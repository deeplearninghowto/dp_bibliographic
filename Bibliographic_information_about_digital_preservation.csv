C. Harris,1991,The preservation considerations in electronic security systems,"Preservation of library collections has not been a concern in design and implementation of security systems. However, electronic security systems affect the long term preservation of ma-terials and damage should be as limited as possible. Electronic Security Systems arc only one in a range of security measures that must be used by a library. To meet the goals of preserving the collection for future access, the security systems must relate to the types of materials and the mission of the library. © 1991 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

M. Foot,1994,ASPECTS OF MASS CONSERVATION,"During the 19th century, increasing demand for paper and advances in science and technology transformed paper making from a craft to an industrial manufacturing process. Different raw-materials and new processes have produced paper that is chemically unstable. The increase in atmospheric pollution has accelerated the chemical degradation of paper, while the growth in library use has increased mechanical breakdown. The ''brittle book problem'' is one which concerns all libraries. It is of such magnitude that conventional hand treatments are no longer sufficient.A number of mass conservation treatments are available, others are still in an experimental stage. They can be divided into processes that preserve the information content through re-formatting and those that preserve the format as well as the content. Among the former are microfilming (microfiche production) and digitizing, while the latter include mass-deacidification and paper strengthening.Microfilming is by far the most widely used and best tested method. However, it is both costly and slow. The most recent re-formatting method is by digitizing texts, either directly or from microform. A number of experiments have shown that digital preservation depends on copying, not on the survival of the physical media. New media formats themselves constitute a preservation problem.Three mass-deacidification processes are currently in use; a further three claim both to deacidify and to strengthen the paper. The basic principles of these processes have been briefly described and their effectiveness and their pros and cons discussed. Nothwithstanding the fact that not all these processes have been properly verified and that the results of comparative studies to analyze and evaluate them have not yet been published, the following observations can be made:1. No existing treatment can be applied to all kinds of paper and to all constituents of the bound book.2. There are doubts about the homogeneity and effectiveness of some of these treatments.3. Some of these processes have an adverse impact on the environment.4. None of these processes sufficiently strengthens highly degraded paper.Consequently, libraries must first of all assess their deacidification needs, they must decide which processes are most appropriate for the diversity of their collections, they must assess the impact of mass treatments on their day-to-day management of the collections and they must assess the financial and staffing resources required to meet their present and future conservation needs. They then must try and address those needs in cooperation with other libraries in order to have at least a chance of preserving knowledge recorded on brittle paper worldwide."
J. Gertz,1996,Selection for preservation: A digital solution for illustrated texts,"The point of selection for preservation is to identify endangered library and archival materials that have long-term intellectual value and are therefore worth the effort and cost of long-term preservation. Technical issues cannot be separated from selection for preservation, because the limits of preservation technologies can influence decisions. At least for the present, we need to combine digitization with analog preservation methods. This hybrid approach"" operates on an assumption that we can in fact make a digital version of the original, and that the digital version will be able to serve the needs that justified selecting the item for preservation in the first place. Columbia University Libraries' Preservation Division has been experimenting with the hybrid digital approach, selecting digitization as the preservation method for materials that previously had to be rejected because our reformatting technologies could not copy them in a way that made the contents accessible to users. In 1994 Columbia undertook a project funded by the Commission on Preservation and Access to combine film with digitization and test the hybrid approach on illustrated materials. We have demonstrated that scanning the microfiche can, in fact, produce digital images with legibility equal to the images made directly from the original printed maps. While legibility was quite successfully achieved during the project, questions remain about the quality of the color that can be delivered to the viewer. Capture is one side of the coin, delivery is the other."""
P. Conway,1996,Selecting microfilm for digital preservation: A case study from Project Open Book,"Project Open Book is Yale University Library's multiyear, multifaceted study exploring the feasibility of converting preservation microfilm to digital imagery and enhancing both physical and intellectual access to the resulting collection of digital files. Selection is the central intellectual challenge; challenges are outlined from Yale's case study that will also have bearing on content-oriented selection for digital conversion of books that have been microfilmed in the nation's Brittle Books Program. The approach outlined here for building a digital library from microfilm of the nation's most important brittle books places collection managers under the same umbrella with the other parties interested in creating and then preserving the availability of digital resources. The lessons from Project Open Book about selection of microfilm point to very concrete and achievable solutions for everyone involved in preservation microfilming and the digital conversion of that film."

M. Hedstrom,1997,Digital Preservation: A Time Bomb for Digital Libraries,"The difficulty and expense of preserving digital information is a potential impediment to digital library development. Preservation of traditional materials became more successful and systematic after libraries and archives integrated preservation into overall planning and resource allocation. Digital preservation is largely experimental and replete with the risks associated with untested methods. Digital preservation strategies are shaped by the needs and constraints of repositories with little consideration for the requirements of current and future users of digital scholarly resources. This article discusses the present state of digital preservation, articulates requirements of both users and custodians, and suggests research needs in storage media, migration, conversion, and overall management strategies. Additional research in these areas would help developers of digital libraries and other institutions with preservation responsibilities to integrate long-term preservation into program planning, administration, system architectures, and resource allocation. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

D. M. Levy,1998,Heroic measures: reflections on the possibility and purpose of digital preservation,"Preserving digital information is a difficult and poorly understood problem. The current inability to accomplish digital preservation is a major impediment to the adoption of digital forms on a grand scale. Recognizing this, in December, 1994 the Commission on Preservation and Access (CPA) and the Research Libraries Group (RLG) convened a Task Force on Digital Archiving. In May, 1996 the Task Force issued its report, entitled 'Preserving Digital Information: Report of the Task Force on Archiving of Digital Information.' This paper has been written in the context of, and partly as a response to, the Task Force report. It analyzes migration as a preservation strategy and, as a counterweight to an overly narrow technical focus on 'the digital object,' it argues that use considerations - the purposes for which the digital materials being preserved are to be used - must figure centrally in any preservation strategy."

P. Z. Adelstein; F. S. Frey,1998,New Developments on Standards for the Permanence of Electronic Media,"One of the major obstacles to the long-term preservation of electronic media is the lack of standards. Existing industry standards"" tend to be distillations of vendor responses to the imperatives of a competitive marketplace. As such, preservation is seldom a priority. Preservation of electronic media is dependent upon the permanence of the media, the hardware and the software. All three are essential for retrievability of information which is only machine readable. Permanence of the magnetic tape or optical disk media is very dependent upon the material as manufactured. Hardware availability requires that parts be obtainable when they become worn out. Consequently format obsolescence is a major consideration. In the United States, a committee accredited by the American National Standards Institute was formed to address the subject of magnetic tape and optical disk permanence. This committee has been meeting regularly since 1989 and to date two standards have been published and several more are in progress. The first is a test method to establish the expected life of CD-ROM optical disks. Since optical disks do not undergo physical stress when used, the test method was based on an optical readout after accelerated incubation. The second standard concerns the proper storage conditions for magnetic tape. Work in progress on test methods is to determine the useful life of CD-MO and CD-R disks, and recommended storage for optical disks. A document on the care and handling of magnetic tape is in preparation. The promise of broadly accepted standards is that institutions charged with the preservation of cultural material can embrace new technology while managing the inevitability of equipment and file format obsolescence."""

Despite the growing importance of digital data, the wider community pays almost no attention to the problems of preserving this digital information for the future. Even within the archival and library communities most work on digital preservation has been theoretical, not practical, and highlights the problems rather than giving solutions. Physical libraries have to preserve information for long periods and this is no less true of their digital equivalents. This paper describes the preservation approach adopted in the Victorian Electronic Record Strategy (VERS) which is currently being trialed within the Victorian government, one of the states of Australia. We review the various preservation approaches that have been suggested and describe in detail encapsulation, the approach which underlies the VERS format. A key difference between the VERS project and previous digital preservation project is the focus within VERS on the construction of actual systems to test and implement the proposed technology. VERS is not a theoretical study in preservation."

An integrated approach is presented that provides solutions to problems related to newspaper page image enhancement, segmentation of pages into various items (titles, text, images etc), article identification and reconstruction, and, finally, recognition of the textual components. Emphasis is placed on the most difficult intermediate stages of page segmentation and article identification and reconstruction. Detailed experimental results, obtained from a large testbed of old newspaper issues, are presented which clearly demonstrate the applicability of our methodology to the successful retro-conversion of newspaper material. © 2000 Springer-Verlag."

D. Huttenlocher; A. Moll,2000,On DigiPaper and the dissemination of electronic documents,"Encoding electronic documents involves a tradeoff between maximizing the ease of dissemination and preserving the document appearance. For instance, a simple text file is the most easily and universally disseminated form of document, but it preserves none of the appearance. This paper proposes a new image-based document representation, called DigiPaper, which is designed to easily disseminate electronic documents with a guaranteed appearance, thus eliminating the tradeoff. DigiPaper provides fixed appearance by representing documents in image form, but uses new compression techniques to make the file size comparable to formats such as Word, PowerPoint or PDF. DigiPaper compression is based on two technologies, the Mixed Raster Content (MRC) color image model and token-compression. DigiPaper files are much smaller than current image formats used for scanning, achieving about a factor of 7 improvement in compression over TIFF Group 4 compressed images. Electronic documents have forever changed the ways in which we share information, primarily due to the ease with which they can be disseminated compared to physical documents. Electronic documents can be more widely and cheaply disseminated because they can be transmitted across networks, replicated virtually for free, and accessed simultaneously by multiple users. Thus, as a medium for the dissemination of information, electronic documents are considerably more powerful than physical media such as paper. Certain underlying assumptions that aid in the dissemination of electronic documents limit their usefulness, however. One such assumption is that the information in a document is carried primarily by its textual content, at the expense of the information carried by other elements such as layout and design. For instance, markup languages such as SGML and HTML focus on the textual content and make the specification of most layout, font, and other design content secondary. While this assumption is most evident in HTML, it is reflected to some degree in every electronic document representation, including layout based"" representations such as PostScript and PDF. Because it is assumed that a document can be successfully transmitted by distributing its text, electronic documents have an intrinsic malleability in their rendering. This is manifested in common features which allow networked documents to be displayed on a multitude of platforms, such as the ability to make a font substitution when the specified font is not available or to adapt the aspect ratio of a document to that of the monitor or browser window. The most malleable (least fixed) form of a document is simple ASCII text, which specifies no information about appearance. A highly malleable document format is preferable when a document is to be presented in highly different ways, such as color versus monochrome, or on very different devices, such as a Palm Pilot and a photographic printer. In these situations, breadth of dissemination is privileged over appearance, and a malleable format that preserves text content over appearance is greatly advantageous. While document malleability increases the potential for dissemination of the textual content, it limits the potential for dissemination of design and layout information, which are often very important in conveying information. The world of printed-paper documents has a centuries-long tradition of valuing document presentation for the information that it carries and for its communicative effect. Print publications have traditionally used the graphic elements of documents as an important aid in conveying meaning. Fonts, layout, and graphics appeal to our senses, reinforcing the connotations and emotional response the document tries to elicit. The physical characteristics of the medium allow the designer to determine to a large extent the visual experience of the reader. Graphic design has an increasing presence in today's business documents (e.g., annual reports, brochures, and product catalogs), making company literature more appealing and easier to understand fo the reader. Many authors and designers moving to the digital medium have been unwilling to abandon the practice of controlling document appearance. Despite the difficulties entailed in precisely encoding the layout of a page in HTML, the majority of well-designed web sites go to great lengths to control the page seen by the reader to the finest detail. They often use elements of HTML such as tables and images in ways not originally intended. In the minds of the designers of these web sites, the value of document appearance clearly outweighs the advantages of the malleable electronic document. Extensions to HTML such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are intended to extend the ability of the designer to fix the appearance of the document. However, these extensions still do not provide the kind of control over appearance that is afforded by paper documents. Furthermore, for a malleable form of document, the document creator does not really know how the document will look, and cannot control the document's visual impact on the reader. By neglecting document presentation, the electronic document risks losing this valuable avenue of expression. In this paper, we argue that there is an important role for electronic documents with a guaranteed fixed appearance that can be controlled by the document creator, much as with paper documents. Today, the need for networked documents with a fixed appearance is met by one of two methods. The first method is using a standardized page description language (PDL), such as Postscript or PDF. This approach has the advantages that Postscript and PDF are widely used, they are relatively compact (e.g., compared to image formats such as TIFF), and they encode much of the document structure. Nevertheless, the disadvantages of this method are substantial. To varying degrees, PDLs are not sufficiently standardized and require considerable processing power to display. Moreover, in practice they cannot guarantee the document appearance. Standard PDF and PostScript files are rendered differently on each device. This is sometimes imperceptible, but many users encounter documents they cannot view or print, or that appear in a distorted manner, especially when the correct fonts are not available. A few niche markets, such as publishing, use digital images of a document as a means of addressing the need for a fixed electronic form of the document. Digital images provide guaranteed appearance: the placement of text and graphic art is fixed, fonts are not an issue, and text, art, and photographs can be mixed at will. In addition, the document can be viewed or printed without requiring the application that generated it (such as MS Word or PowerPoint), nor requiring a PDL renderer such as Adobe Acrobat or a Postscript viewer. This solution of transmitting electronic documents using an image representation has become standard in communities such as publishing and digital archiving. Publishers send books to press as TIFF images (often embedded in PostScript), thus avoiding problems caused by the lack of appropriate fonts in the printer. In digital archival repositories, the current practice is to use TIFF files with CCITT Group 4 compression as a preservation format. However, digital document images have one main drawback that prevents them from being used more widely: they tend to be very large. Consequently, they use a lot of storage and transmit too slowly for the majority of users. Their use is only cost effective in very specific cases where storage and bandwidth considerations are not an issue. This paper proposes a new image-based document representation, DigiPaper,1 to encode efficiently document appearance and maintain the high dissemination potential characteristic of the electronic medium. DigiPaper provides guaranteed appearance, relies to a minimum on the environment in which it is rendered (e.g., does not require particular fonts or the application that created the document), and thus is readable by a varied audience. It eliminates the tradeoff between maximizing dissemination and preserving documen appearance that today faces the creator of electronic documents. DigiPaper is designed to meet the need for a fixed electronic form of a document, while keeping file sizes small. It can be used successfully both with scanned and electronic source documents. Electronic source documents include those rendered to page images from page description languages such as Postscript (so called RIPped documents), and those generated with text processors or presentation software such as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. DigiPaper is a structured image representation for documents. One of the main reasons document images are so large is that current formats do not take sufficient advantage of the special nature of document images. For instance, most documents are composed of different types of content. Text, photographs, graphs, tables, and business graphics often appear together in a single page. A single treatment (i.e., resolution, color depth, compression) is never suited to all these kinds of material, but conventional document image formats do not provide good support for combining multiple encoding techniques. By using a structured image representation, with different layers for different kinds of material, it is possible to obtain much better compression. DigiPaper applies to each such layer an encoding method that is appropriate to that type of material, thereby providing a good trade-off between storage efficiency and image quality. To represent the different content types in the multiple layers, DigiPaper uses the Mixed Raster Content (MRC) imaging model. For compression, DigiPaper makes heavy use of token compression."""

Paper records, for the most part, could be stored for decades and thus formed the backbone of corporate memory. In today's business environment, records of value are being created in applications that may be obsolete in as few as three years. Yet those ephemeral records have begun to house more and more of the corporate memory that will likely be required for the organization's functioning for many years. Government agencies face even greater challenges since records may need to be kept for hundreds if not thousands of years. And even when organizations do preserve their electronic records, what guarantees do they have that the electronic records they DO save are authentic and reliable?The InterPARES (INTERnational Research on the Preservation of Authentic Records in Electronic Systems) project was conceived to conduct systematic research into the problem of preserving authentic electronic records over time; to research the state of the art in electronic records management and preservation; and to develop strategies for the long-term preservation of electronic records. The project, officially begun in 1999, is a collaborative effort, drawing together researchers from universities, industry, and national archives from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, with backgrounds in computer science, engineering, preservation, archival theory and practice, information systems, research science, business, and government administration.

The case studies consist of interviews with records creators and administrators who are involved with the systems, supported by system schematics, documentation, user manuals, and flow charts. From their analysis of these systems, the researchers are identifying common themes and elements of record-keeping systems and the records within them in order to target those elements that help preserve authenticity over time for preservation purposes; and model record-keeping systems and processes.This panel will discuss the project goals and results of the data analysis to date, conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles under the direction of Dr. Anne Gilliland-Swetland in the Department of information Studies."

N. Beagrie,2000,The British experience in preserving digital library collections,"The increasing amount of information being produced digitally is impacting on and changing forever the expectations of users in all spheres of life. Digital access has many advantages over paper-based access in terms of convenience and functionality. However there are challenges, not yet wholly resolved, associated with ensuring that the many and varied digital resources being created will continue to be accessible. The long-term preservation of research collections in digital form is therefore an issue of increasing concern to research libraries around the world. Preservation and access to this information is dependent on impermanent media and technologies and adapting or re-engineering existing organisational and legal frameworks. © LIBER 1999.

A. Basu; I. Cheng,2001,Super high resolution 3D imaging and efficient visualization,"In this paper we describe and demonstrate our technology for creating super high resolution (SHR) & 3D digital content in a variety of applications including museum artifacts and galleries, archeology, anthropology, art design and heritage conservation. Our hardware can capture minute details of static scenes in a composite panoramic format with details surpassing the human eye. We also propose an approach to storing SHR images for efficient retrieval over bandwidth limited networks, such as the Internet. Regions of interest (ROIs) specified by users are stored in multiple levels of detail hierarchy. This hierarchy can be created by analyzing the contrast, texture or other feature changes with varying levels of resolution and creating a hierarchy of ROIs. The depth of the hierarchy for a given ROI is determined by following the changes in the contrast (or other feature) gradient over adjacent levels. An implementation of the browser for Virtual Museums is also presented. In addition to browsing images, our software provides the ability to support interactive story telling."" As viewers interact with a picture using a mouse, the descriptions of objects in the scene appear depending on the location of the mouse and the level of detail in the scene. Finally, the ""Zoomage"" tools can be used by academic researchers for various applications including object recognition, digital archiving, accurate stereo reconstruction, and 3D visualization."""

There is a global trend towards extending legal deposit to cover digital publications in order to maintain comprehensive national archives. However, including digital publications in legal deposit regulations is not enough to ensure the long-term preservation of these publications. Indeed, there are many practical difficulties associated with the entire deposit process. Concepts, principles and practices that are accepted and understood in the print environment, such as publication, publisher, place of publication and edition, may have new meanings or no longer be appropriate in a networked environment. Mechanisms for identifying, selecting and depositing digital material either do not exist or are inappropriate for some kinds of digital publication. There is a great deal of work on developing digital preservation strategies: this is at an early stage. National and other deposit libraries are at the forefront of research and development in this area, often in partnership with other libraries, publishers and technology vendors. Most of this activity is of a technical nature. There is some work on developing policies and strategies for managing digital resources.

In this paper, we discuss how autonomous sites can cooperate to provide preservation by trading data. We examine the decisions that an archive must make when forming trading networks, such as the amount of storage space to provide and the best number of partner sites. We also deal with the fact that some sites may be more reliable than others. Experimental results from a data trading simulator illustrate which policies are most reliable. Our techniques focus on preserving the bits"" of digital collections; other services that focus on other archiving concerns (such as preserving meaningful metadata) can be built on top of the system we describe here."""
B. Ludäscher; R. Marciano; R. Moore,2001,"Preservation of digital data with self-validating, self-instantiating knowledge-based archives","Digital archives are dedicated to the long-term preservation of electronic information and have the mandate to enable sustained access despite rapid technology changes. Persistent archives are confronted with heterogeneous data formats, helper applications, and platforms being used over the lifetime of the archive. This is not unlike the interoperability challenges, for which mediators are devised. To prevent technological obsolescence over time and across platforms, a migration approach for persistent archives is proposed based on an XML infrastructure. We extend current archival approaches that build upon standardized data formats and simple metadata mechanisms for collection management, by involving high-level conceptual models and knowledge representations as an integral part of the archive and the ingestion/migration processes. Infrastructure independence is maximized by archiving generic, executable specifications of (i) archival constraints (i.e., “model validators), and (ii) archival transformations that are part of the ingestion process. The proposed architecture facilitates construction of self-validating and self-instantiating knowledge-based archives. We illustrate our overall approach and report on first experiences using a sample collection from a collaboration with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)."""
B. Ludäscher; R. Marciano; R.

Current archival approaches build upon standardized data formats and simple metadata mechanisms for collection management, but do not involve high-level conceptual models and knowledge representations. This results in serious limitations, not only for expressing various kinds of information and knowledge about the archived data, but also for creating infrastructure independent, self-validating and self-instantiating archives. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a scalable XML-based archival infrastructure, based on standard tools, and subsequently show how this architecture can be extended to a model-based framework, where higher-level knowledge representations become an integral part of the archive and the ingestion/migration processes. This allows us to maximize infrastructure independence by archiving generic, executable specifications of (i) archival constraints (i.e., model validators""), and (ii) archival transformations that are part of the ingestion process.

From the OAIS reference model to practical applications,"Long term preservation of digital information poses critical new problems in all modern society business sectors. The Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System, soon to become an ISO standard, provides us with a vocabulary and a set of unifying concepts which can be used to understand the problem as a whole and also to enable communities, which were previously completely unknown to each other, to become acquainted and consult together on the joint solutions which may be envisaged. This Model does not constitute an implementation diagram, however, it is a permanent conceptual background for all implementations. Now we can use this background as an aid to improve analysis of past difficulties encountered in the preservation of digital information in the space field.The primary pragmatic rules implemented to counteract these difficulties may be described and analyzed in the light of the OAIS RM concepts."

In this paper, we describe the initial results of our efforts towards understandingdi gital (as well as traditional) preservation problems from first principles. Our approach is to use the language of mathematics to formalize the concepts that are relevant to preservation. Our theory of preservation spaces draws upon ideas from logic and programming language semantics to describe the relationship between concrete objects and their information contents. We also draw on game theory to show how objects change over time as a result of uncontrollable environment effects and directed preservation actions. In the second half of this paper, we show how to use the mathematics of universal algebra as a language for objects whose information content depends on many components. We use this language to describe both migration and emulation strategies for digital preservation. [Due to space constraints, the second part of the paper has been omitted.

L. Sijtsma,2001,The Dutch Deposit of Electronic Publications (DNEP) - 1995-2000,"In 1993 the Internet took off with the introduction of HTML and the first browser (Mosaic). Two years later, in 1995, the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) decided to start a series of experiments and projects which would lead to a deposit system for Dutch Electronic Publications. In the same year the KB made a policy decision to include electronic material into its deposit. That marked the start of the Dutch Deposit for Electronic Publications (DNEP). Both as an operational service and at the same time as a test-bed for research into digital archiving. Early 1999 a Request For Information (RFI) was sent out to selected companies. This was done to establish whether the functionalities the KB deemed neccessary for a digital deposit were available in the marketplace. On the basis of the positive outcome of this Request a European Tender was started. The KB developed a process model for a digital deposit as well as detailed functional requirements for such a system. A supplier, IBM, was selected. At the moment (early June 2000) talks about the implementation are in progress. The project will start in the summer of start of autumn of 2000 and will take 24 months. The Dutch government has acknowledged that the establishment of the Dutch electronic bibliography and the DNEP itself are indeed tasks of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek. We expect that appropriate structural funding to supports these tasks will become available. In this paper an overview is given of what the KB has done since 1995 up till now and how this has led to the implementation-project that is about to start. © LIBER 2001. All rights reserved."

M. L. Nelson,2001,A new digital library technology for preserving NASA research,"A fundamental task of research organizations is the preservation and dissemination of their intellectual output. Historically, this has been accomplished with hard copy formats through a multitiered approach of using the open literature, self-publishing, and an array of cooperative libraries and depositories. It can be argued that the historical approach is less than optimal with respect to results achieved and resources expended. However, there have been recent advances in the area of digital libraries (DLs) that address some of the shortcomings of traditional hard copy preservation and dissemination. One of these technologies is buckets,"" an aggregative, intelligent construct for publishing. Buckets exist within the ""Smart Object, Dumb Archive"" (SODA) DL model, which can be summarized as promoting the importance and responsibility of individual information objects and reducing the role of traditional archives and database systems. The goal is that smart objects will be independent of and more resilient to the transient nature of information systems. This paper examines the motivation for buckets and SODA, as well as discussing some initial experiences in using these DL technologies in some US government research laboratories in NASA, the Air Force, and the Department of Energy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

M. Maass; M. Kosonen; M. Kormano,2001,Radiological image data migration - Practical experience and comparison of the costs of work,"Purpose: To identify costs deriving from data migration of obsolete digital archives by measuring the workload, and to analyse migration-associated problems.Material and Methods: Two digital archives were used (DTL and MOD) and the capacity of these archives could no longer support the needs of the Medical Imaging Centre. The entire content of the DLT archive and selected data from the MOD archive were transferred to the current higher capacity (17 TB) tape archive. The running time of work processes was measured by self-reporting, and the cost of work was calculated.Results: The transfer of 43,096 studies required 314 working hours over the course of 15 months in total. The work was partly manual, partly automatic. The percentage of non-retrievable MOD images was 35. Less than 0.2% of the DLT image transfers failed due to incorrect patient or image data. The MOD DLT transfer cost was six times higher per study than the DLT - DLT transmission cost.Conclusion: At present, data migration may be inevitable as the amount of data increases and technology advances. The data transfer proved to be labour intensive, with high fault sensitivity regarding the MOD archive. The cost of work of data migration was 0.4% of estimated digital archiving total yearly cost. Automated data migration is preferable."

P. A. Sykas,2001,The north west pattern book survey,"In 1998, a group of 26 museums, libraries, record offices, and educational institutions in the North West of England commissioned a preliminary survey of their collections of textile pattern books. The aim was to ascertain the quantity, range and quality of the collections, and to provide basic information about access, storage, and conservation needs. This information gathering was the first step in formulating strategies that would enable institutions to promote and expand access to their collections, while providing sufficient standards of care to ensure long-term preservation. Textile manufacturers' pattern books straddle the boundary between manuscripts and museum objects, encompassing both art and industrial production. In the past, this ambiguity led to a lack of consistent policy not only for collecting of material, but also with regard to funding for a acquisition and care. This initiative sought to generate an atmosphere of mutual help that could overcome structural barriers so as to engender further regionally-based collaborative projects."

R. A. Lorie,2001,Long term preservation of digital information,"The preservation of digital data for the long term presents a variety of challenges from technical to social and organizational. The technical challenge is to ensure that the information, generated today, can survive long term changes in storage media, devices and data formats. This paper presents a novel approach to the problem. It distinguishes between archiving of data files and archiving of programs (so that their behavior may be reenacted in the future). For the archiving of a data file, the proposal consists of specifying the processing that needs to be performed on the data (as physically stored) in order to return the information to a future client (according to a logical view of the data). The process specification and the logical view definition are archived with the data. For the archiving of a program behavior, the proposal consists of saving the original executable object code together with the specification of the processing that needs to be performed for each machine instruction of the original computer (emulation). In both cases, the processing specification is based on a Universal Virtual Computer that is general, yet basic enough as to remain relevant in the future."

While a number of commercial systems have been developed for the scanning of bound volumes, there has been a very few efforts to develop a system for the scanning of fragile books. Here we present a bookscanner system developed at Xerox PARC specifically for the scanning and preservation of rare and fragile books. The initial requirements for the design were originally taken from guidelines proposed by the US Library of Congress for their preservation efforts. The present design consists of an operator controlled 90° book cradle and wedge platen which precisely defines the image plane; a 4k×4k 12 bit CCD camera with external color filters; a rotating mirror which allows for the computer to select which of the two opposing pages to capture. The combined camera, mechanical, optical and control systems allow the capture of 10×12 inch, 300DPI grayscale and color images. The optimal throughput of this system approaches that of current benchmark microfiche systems (500 grayscale pages/hour) without appreciably impacting the handling of the fragile books. Considerations during the design process and customer research results will be presented along with the present design and performance data."

As examples, libraries and archival institutions need to support flexible online learning services; support collaborative cross-sectoral cultural programs; respond to the challenge of digital preservation and encourage a program of research and collaboration; manage traditional and digital collections in an integrated manner; manage text in different scripts in an integrated manner; and ensure persistent access to digital information resources. © 2001, MCB UP Ltd."
B. F. Cooper; H. Garcia-Molina,2002,Peer-to-peer data trading to preserve information,"Data archiving systems rely on replication to preserve information. This paper discusses how a network of autonomous archiving sites can trade data to achieve the most reliable replication. A series of binary trades among sites produces a peer-to-peer archiving network. Two trading algorithms are examined, one based on trading collections (even if they are different sizes) and another based on trading equal sized blocks of space (which can then store collections). The concept of deeds is introduced; deeds track the blocks of space owned by one site at another. Policies for tuning these algorithms to provide the highest reliability, for example by changing the order in which sites are contacted and offered trades, are discussed. Finally, simulation results are presented that reveal which policies are best. The experiments indicate that a digital archive can achieve the best reliability by trading blocks of space (deeds), and that following certain policies will allow that site to maximize its reliability. © 2002 ACM."
B. Heterick,2002,Applying the lessons learned from retrospective archiving to the digital archiving conundrum,"Since 1995, JSTOR has been converting the backfiles of important scholarly journals, in a multitude of academic disciplines, from their paper origins to a digital archive. As a not-for-profit organization, JSTOR's mission is to create a shared and trusted archive of important journal literature, regardless of whether that literature is pulp-based or born digital"". As we now begin to take on the varied challenges involved in receiving, enabling for display, and archiving content published electronically, we will draw from the extensive experience base we have developed from our seven years of work in creating and maintaining a substantial electronic database. While not all of JSTOR's experience in the retrospective conversion of paper journals is directly applicable to the digital world, we do believe it is reasonable to say that what we have learned to this point can be a useful guide in (1) asking the right questions and (2) challenging certain assumptions."""
B. Smith,2002,Preserving tomorrow's memory: Preserving digital content for future generations,"There is an increasing attention being paid to the problem of long-term digital preservation, and in particular that associated with born digital"" material. This paper was prepared in order to better understand the challenges, identify topics that need to be treated at a policy level, and prepare for a possible action package on the issue. The paper can be seen as a background document to a series of expert meeting that will be held during the year 2002, as such it is not written in a formal style, nor is it intended to have a persistent impact on the subject. The reader is encouraged to contact the author to obtain up-to-date information on the topic. The overall topic of long-term preservation is a challenge in itself, however it has also been identified in an ongoing initiative sponsored by the European Commission concerning digitisation policies and programmes (see the Lund Conclusions, http://www.cordis.lu/ist/ka3/digicult/en/eeurope.html)."""
B. Wegner,2002,EMANI - A project for the long-term preservation of electronic publications in mathematics,"With the rapidly growing activities in electronic publishing ideas came up to install global repositories, which deal with three main-streams in this enterprise: storing the electronic material currently available, pursuing projects to solve the long-term archiving problem for this material with the ambition to preserve the content in readable form for future generations, and to capture the printed literature in digital versions providing good access and search facilities for the readers. Longterm availability of published research articles in mathematics and easy access to them is a strong need for researchers working with mathematics. Hence in this domain some pioneering projects have been established trying to tackle the above-mentioned problems.The article will describe some of these activities and touch the plan to develop a global Digital Mathematical Library (DML). As a special project for mathematics in the archiving area the Electronic Mathematics Archives Network Initiative (EMANI) had been designed. Having in mind that a distributed architecture would be more suitable and reduce the load on the partners for such a project, a network is proposed, which also might be a more open approach for extending the project from a initially restricted solution to a more comprehensive enterprise. For the core of the network, a co-operational system of reference libraries and content providers like publishers and editors has been be set up. On the side of the libraries the following partners have agreed to set up a prototype for the archive: the Tsinghua University Library in Beijing, the Cornell University Library in Ithaca (N.Y.), the French partner Math-Doc and the Lower Saxony State and University Library in Gottingen. The first group of content providers consists of the Springer publishing house, associated publishers and journals posted in the Electronic Library of EMIS. This report refers to the state of EMANI after the fourth EMANI workshop in Paris at the beginning of April 2003."
C. L. Borgman,2002,Challenges in building digital libraries for the 21st century,"After a decade of research and development, digital libraries are becoming operational systems and services. This paper summarizes some of the challenges required for that transition. Digital libraries as systems are converging with digital libraries as institutions, particularly as we consider the service aspects. They are enabling technologies for applications such as classroom instruction, information retrieval, and electronic commerce. Because usability depends heavily upon context, research on uses and users of digital libraries needs to be conducted in a wide array of environments. Interoperability and scaling continue to be major issues, but the problems are better understood. While technical work on interoperability and scaling continues, institutional collaboration is an emerging focus. Concerns for an information infrastructure to support digital libraries is moving toward the concept of “cyber infrastructure,” now that distributed networks are widely deployed and access is becoming ubiquitous. Appropriate evaluation methods and metrics are requirements for sustainable digital libraries that have received little attention until recently. We need to know what works and in what contexts. Evaluation has many aspects and can address a variety of goals, such as usability, maintainability, interoperability, scalability, and economic viability. Lastly, two areas that have received considerable discussion elsewhere are noted -- digital preservation and the role of information institutions such as libraries and archives. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002."

Goldman,2002,Access to large spoken archives: Uses and technology,"With recent advances in information technology, digital archiving is emerging as an important and practical method for capturing the human experience. Large amounts of spoken materials and audiovisual materials in which speech is an important component are becoming available. This panel will discuss the uses of these materials for education, information retrieval and dissemination, and research, the requirements that arise from these uses, and speech recognition and retrieval technologies being developed to meet these requirements. These materials have tremendous potential for enriching the presentation of information in education, newscasts and documentaries, but retrieval from and access to these large repositories pose significant challenges.

E. Roel,2002,The Journal of Insect Science: Challenging the dominant electronic journal pricing paradigm or how to create your own scholarly publication in partnership with your campus faculty,"The Journal of Insect Science is a collaborative project between the Digital Library Initiatives Group, a faculty member in the Department of Entomology, and the Library's faculty liaison to the Department of Entomology at the University of Arizona. This is a journal of international scope, with prestigious international advisory and editorial boards. With the Editorial Board serving to ensure the caliber of accepted articles, the acceptance rate of the Journal is no higher than those of prestigious print journals. The Journal was developed due to a common philosophy between Editor and Library faculty: that the costs of accessing electronic journals are becoming prohibitive, and that authors must once again become the copyright holders of their own work. As a unit serving the academic faculty, we have an ethical obligation to present alternatives to these two post-modern trends in electronic publishing to ensure a robust environment of scholarly exchange. JIS is currently produced and technically supported by the University of Arizona Library. Our SPARC-affiliated journal has been extremely well-received, and is currently indexed in Biosis, Agricola, Chemical Abstracts, Commonwealth Agriculture Bureaux, and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts. JIS (beta) is currently under development: this version of the Journal will exist as XML documents, allowing for its submission for indexing in PubMed Central and BioOne. The process of creating an online journal in conjunction with a campus faculty member and with international submitters is still under development, with considerations on our end of production being shaped by best practices in digital archiving, preservation, and access. JIS is serving as a model for others interested in challenging the dominant electronic publishing paradigm."
G. M. Hodge,2002,Digital preservation: Overview of current developments,"ICSTI and ICSU Press, with support from UNESCO, co-sponsored a workshop on digital archiving that brought major stakeholders together to identify the key issues for each group in January 2000. The state of digital archiving art and practice at the time of that conference is compared to February 2002 based on several maturity factors"". These factors include: the existence and adoption of a framework, operational systems, guidelines and standards, supportive technologies, and policies. An analysis of these factors shows that digital preservation is maturing. The trend is toward practical implementations, operational systems, and the institutionalization of best practices and standards. The move is toward more cooperative efforts, particularly in the areas of international standards development. Many current projects include multiple stakeholder groups. Science has benefited and contributed to the maturing of this field. However, incorporation of these principles into the workflow of scientists and engineers remains critical to preserving the record of science."""
H. Berthon; S. Thomas; C. Webb,2002,Safekeeping: A cooperative approach to building a digital preservation resource,"In May 2001 a project commenced that aimed to build a distributed and permanent collection of digital resources from the field of digital preservation. All resources incorporated in this 'safekeeping' project have been selected from the PADI (Preserving Access to Digital Information) subject gateway database. This article describes the first phase of the safekeeping project that is being undertaken by the National Library of Australia, with funding from CLIR (Council on Library and Information Resources). This project aims to identify significant resources in digital preservation early in their lifecycle. It also aims to facilitate the cooperative development of a distributed network of 'safekept' material with resource owners, or parties nominated by them, providing long-term access to their material. We anticipate that a diversity of technical and organizational solutions will be employed within this project that relies on cooperation within the digital preservation community, rather than on formal agreements, to realize an asset of communal value. This article discusses some early findings and outcomes of the safekeeping project; however, a full assessment of this approach must await evaluation over an extended period."

J. F. Steenbakkers,2002,Preserving electronic publications,"Scientific journals are more and more published electronically. Gradually the amount of e-books increases and on Internet a vast amount of digital information is being published. Electronic publishing offers major opportunities for dissemination and for access but at the same time imposes new challenges on national libraries and other deposit institutes in charge of preserving countries' cultural heritage. The challenges that have to be addressed are preservation of the electronic publications. In the past years national libraries have taken the lead in developing practical solutions for digital preservation. Together with IBM both the Koninklijke Bibliotheek - national library of the Netherlands - and the British Library - national library of England - are developing an OAIS compliant deposit system. The system of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek will be operational at the end of 2002 and will be the core of the Electronic Deposit of the Netherlands. As a deposit system could not be bought of the shelf, the approach chosen was to team up with a major ICT partner and jointly develop the deposit system. Parallel with the development of the deposit system, the aspects of long-term access were investigated. A proof of concept was done by IBM with 'data preservation' using a Universal Virtual Computer (UVC). The Koninklijke Bibliotheek and IBM jointly will soon publish a series of reports on the long-term preservation aspects of a deposit system."

Through creation of a multi-agency digital repository, state government can provide for the lawful management of email records and build a large knowledge base that can be tapped for information that will enhance business and growth. The proposed trusted repository concept ensures that records of a truly transitory nature are destroyed efficiently and legally rather than left to accumulate in ever increasing numbers in an unwieldy manner in networked computing systems. The repository preserves the official business records of state government and can expand access services to a customer base that includes the agencies within state government and the public it serves. Finally, it is anticipated that lessons learned in its implementation will allow its eventual expansion to encompass all the digital records of Texas state government."

P. Mellor; P. Wheatley; D. Sergeant,2002,"Migration on request, a practical technique for preservation","Maintaining a digital object in a usable state over time is a crucial aspect of digital preservation. Existing methods of preserving have many drawbacks. This paper describes advanced techniques of data migration which can be used to support preservation more accurately and cost effectively. To ensure that preserved works can be rendered on current computer systems over time, “traditional migration” has been used to convert data into current formats. As the new format becomes obsolete another conversion is performed, etcetera. Traditional migration has many inherent problems as errors during transformation propagate throughout future transformations. CAMiLEON’s software longevity principles can be applied to a migration strategy, offering improvements over traditional migration. This new approach is named “Migration on Request.” Migration on Request shifts the burden of preservation onto a single tool, which is maintained over time. Always returning to the original format enables potential errors to be significantly reduced. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002."

Unlike paper records that can survive for hundreds of years unless measures are taken to destroy them, electronic records do not persist unless deliberate steps are taken to preserve them. This paper suggests that most Israeli (and possibly other) government institutions naturally take steps to preserve electronic records necessary for their ongoing immediate operational needs. Nonimmediate or extraoperational needs, such as archiving according to state laws, are not given the fullest attention. To preserve the historical record of government institutions, computer systems must be designed and budgeted to comply with state archive laws and the long-term needs of society. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This is obviously good news in that an expanded body of digital records, publications, and other objects will be preserved and made available. What is less obvious is that there is no magic bullet in the offing for dealing with all permanent digital materials: only a fraction will meet necessary conditions for optimal preservation and use. Materials that deviate from these conditions can still be included in digital collections, but finding and using them will be more difficult, perhaps substantially so. This article outlines conditions that govern the persistence of digital materials and suggests a model for future levels of service for digital repositories."

Muir,2003,Copyright and licensing issues for digital preservation and possible solutions,"The preservation of digital publications involves various technical, legal, economic and organization issues. Copyright law and licensing arrangements may prevent problems for libraries that wish to preserve digital resources in the long-term or even short term. Digital preservation strategies involve copying and it is not clear with copyright legislation in the UK and Europe will allow the sort of copying needed. The complex nature of digital publications and new publishing models present various problems including resource intensive rights clearance and reliance on publishers to continue to provide access and preserve digital publications. Extension of legal deposit laws may go some way to overcoming access versus ownership issues, but the issue of rights to copy deposited material remains. Other possible solutions include model licence agreements that that provide for preservation in some way. There is a need for research to clarify issues identified in the preservation and legal literature and to provide a clearer picture of the activities and perceptions of stakeholders in digital preservation, including authors, publishers and libraries."

D. S. H.

The fundamental problem for any digital preservation system is that it must be affordable for the long term. To reduce the cost of ownership, the LOCKSS system uses generic PC hardware, open source software, and peer-to-peer technology. It is packaged as a “network appliance”, a single-function box that can be connected to the Internet, configured and left alone to do its job with minimal monitoring or administration. The first version of this system was based on a Linux boot floppy. After three years of testing it was replaced by a second version, based on OpenBSD and booting from CD-ROM. We focus in this paper on the design, implementation and deployment of a network appliance based on an open source operating system. We provide an overview of the LOCKSS application and describe the experience of deploying and supporting its first version. We list the requirements we took from this to drive the design of the second version, describe how we satisfied them in the OpenBSD environment, and report on the initial deployment of this second version of the appliance. © 2003 The Aerospace Corporation."
E. Oltmans,2003,Legal deposit of digital materials,"Digital publishing is causing a real paradigm shift for research institutions and publishers, as well as for libraries. As a consequence these institutions have to develop new policies, new business models and new infrastructures and techniques. A major problem is that, at the same rate at which our world is becoming digital, the digital information is threatened. New types of hardware, computer applications and file formats supersede each other, making our recorded digital information inaccessible in the long-term. In the past years libraries and archives have undertaken several actions and studies on digital preservation issues. For instance the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) has jointly with IBM developed a standard-based deposit system: Digital Information Archiving System (DIAS). Using DIAS the KB realised in 2002 an electronic deposit (the e-Depot) and signed archiving agreements with major science publishers for permanent keeping of their digital materials. In this paper I will discuss the fully operational e-Depot at the KB. I will focus on the data flow of processing the digital publications, and I will address the issue of digital preservation in detail. © LIBER 2003, All rights reserved."

L. Siew Lin; C. K. Ramaiah; P.

The advent of electronic information introduces new preservation requirements. Medium preservation has been addressed in discussions on environmental and handling concerns for tapes, magnetic disks, optical disks, and the like. Greater attention should instead be directed to the obsolescence of technologies. It is a challenge to imagine not only how to technically preserve electronic records indefinitely, but also how to choose what to preserve and how to guarantee the electronic record's reliability and authenticity in the future. The combined problems of immense volume, unstable storage media, and obsolete hardware and software add up to some very tough problems, which have to be dealt with. Digital preservation is becoming a business issue. Not only are historians, librarians and archivists alarmed by the loss of cultural and government records due to a lack in digital preservation, but certain industries have also realised that they need to keep data longer and longer for regulatory or business reasons. © 2003, MCB UP Limited"

M. Napoli; M. Nanni; S. Cimarra; L. Crisafulli; P. Campioni; P. Marano,2003,Picture archiving and communication in radiology,"After over 80 years of exclusive archiving of radiologic films, at present, in Radiology, digital archiving is increasingly gaining ground. Digital archiving allows a considerable reduction in costs and space saving, but most importantly, immediate or remote consultation of all examinations and reports in the hospital clinical wards, is feasible. The RIS system, in this case, is the starting point of the process of electronic archiving which however is the task of PACS. The latter can be used as radiologic archive in accordance with the law provided that it is in conformance with some specifications as the use of optical long-term storage media or with electronic track of change. PACS archives, in a hierarchical system, all digital images produced by each diagnostic imaging modality. Images and patient data can be retrieved and used for consultation or remote consultation by the reporting radiologist who requires images and reports of previous radiologic examinations or by the referring physician of the ward. Modern PACS owing to the WEB server allow remote access to extremely simplified images and data however ensuring the due regulations and access protections. Since the PACS enables a simpler data communication within the hospital, security and patient privacy should be protected. A secure and reliable PACS should be able to minimize the risk of accidental data destruction, and should prevent non authorized access to the archive with adequate security measures in relation to the acquired knowledge and based on the technological advances. Archiving of data produced by modern digital imaging is a problem now present also in small Radiology services. The technology is able to readily solve problems which were extremely complex up to some years ago as the connection between equipment and archiving system owing also to the universalization of the DICOM 3.0 standard. The evolution of communication networks and the use of standard protocols as TCP/IP can minimize problems of data and image remote transmission within the healthcare enterprise as well as over the territory. However, new problems are appearing as that of digital data security profiles and of the different systems which should ensure it. Among these, algorithms of electronic signature should be mentioned. In Italy they are validated by law and therefore can be used in digital archives in accordance with the law."

P. Rödig; J. Scheffczyk; U. M. Borghoff; L. Schmitz,2003,Preservation of digital publications: An OAIS extension and implementation,"Over the last decades, the amount of digital documents has increased exponentially. Nevertheless, traditional document engineering methods are applied. Even worse, the long-term preservation issues have been neglected in standard document life cycle implementations. Our digital (cultural) heritage is, therefore, highly endangered by the silent obsolescence of data formats, software and hardware. Severe losses of information already happened. It is high time to implement concrete solutions. Fortunately numerous institutions already target these issues. Moreover, with the OAIS reference model1 a rich standardized conceptual framework is available, which already serves as implementation basis.2 This paper discusses an extension to the OAIS reference model and illustrates a prototype implementation of a document life cycle that is enriched by functions for long-term preservation. More precisely, this paper aims to provide first solutions to the following three problem areas: 1. Detachment: OAIS defines no functions for the process of detaching digital documents prior to the ingest function. This detachment function is modeled in great detail and implemented for the provision of the so-called OAIS's submission information packages (SIP). 2. DBMS: OAIS defines a very complex functionality. We show how a standard database management system (DBMS) can support a wide variety of required functionalities in an integrated and homogenous way. Among others OAIS's data management, archival storage, and access are supported. 3. Metadata: So far, OAIS does not cover any aspects of the metadata generation. Here, we briefly discuss the (semi-)automatic generation of a metadata set. In order to evaluate the feasibility of our approach, we built a first prototype. We carried out our experiments in close cooperation with the Bavarian State Library, Munich, which is engaged in numerous international initiatives dealing with the problem of long-term preservation. Our University Library also supported us by delivering a representative test set of digital publications.3 We conclude our paper by presenting some lessons learned from our conceptual work and from our real world experiments."
R. C. Jimerson,2003,Deciding what to save,"Archival appraisal is the process of determining which manuscripts and archives acquired by a repository are worthy of long-term preservation. The abundance of modern records prevents saving everything, so archivists must make difficult choices. Records have value as evidence of organizations’ functions and activities, or for their informational content. Appraisal criteria include analysis of functions, context, content, future uses, and cost-benefit of retention. Decisions to discard manuscripts are irreversible, so choices must be carefully weighed. Reappraisal and deaccessioning may also be applied to legacy holdings. The challenging task of appraisal also contributes to the preservation of institutional evidence, cultural heritage, and social memory. © 2003, MCB UP Limited"

While we have invested significant time and effort to create and capture information in the digital form, and are making great strides towards making digital information available in every community across the world, we do not have the ability to make this information available across generations of information technology, making it accessible with future technology and enabling people to determine whether it is authentic and reliable. This paper reports on the current status of digital preservation, an emerging field involving computer science, information technology, library science, and archival science. Digital preservation must be considered in a broader context, namely the life cycle of information. In the life cycle of information, we describe all essential factors for preserving digital records, including not only formats, structures, and types of digital records but also access software services, computing environments, even security keys and authenticity signatures and certificates of the records.

A. M. Donovan; M. Esteva; P. Galloway; A. Sonder; S.

We reviewed the literature and practice in website archiving and applied what we learned to the specific problem of identifying and archiving the unambiguously institutionally-controlled content on the website of the School of Information, University of Texas-Austin (UT-SI). In the process of developing policies and procedures with content-providers and website managers, we found that a single appraisal episode cannot suffice for dynamic and ephemeral objects like websites, but we also found that if properly specified, an archival harvesting protocol can be effectively integrated with normal backup procedures. This project in the archiving of websites, using MIT's open-source DSpace repository software for its implementation of the Open Archival Information System model, will be used to discuss the task of appraising and identifying archival digital objects for capture and permanent preservation."
A. Muir,2004,"Digital preservation: Awareness, responsibility and rights issues","Digital preservation is likely to involve copying and it is not clear whether UK law will allow the copying required. Negotiation of permission to copy for preservation purposes is likely to be time consuming and complex. Access rather than ownership models means that libraries may not be able to preserve material and other arrangements have to be made. There are various possible approaches to dealing with the issues, including extending legal deposit law, amending copyright and related law, development and use of preservation clauses in licences or collective licensing and the provision of preservation rights metadata. Surveys of libraries and publishers in the UK suggest that there is some lack of awareness of the legal situation and it is not clear how publishers will implement preservation. There is a need for clarification of the legal situation and a raising of awareness. Roles and responsibilities in digital preservation and the impact of new trends in electronic publishing also need to be investigated."

C. C. Marshall; G. Golovchinsky,2004,Saving private hypertext: Requirements and pragmatic dimensions for preservation,"The preservation of literary hypertexts presents significant challenges if we are to ensure continued access to them as the underlying technology changes. Not only does such an effort involve standard digital preservation problems of representing and refreshing metadata, any constituent media types, and structure; hypertext preservation poses additional dimensions that arise from the work's on-screen appearance, its interactive behavior, and the ways a reader's interaction with the work is recorded. In this paper, we describe aspects of preservation introduced by literary hypertexts such as the need to reproduce their modes of interactivity and their means of capturing and using records of reading. We then suggest strategies for addressing the pragmatic dimensions of hypertext preservation and discuss their status within existing digital preservation schemes. Finally, we examine the possible roles various stakeholders within and outside of the hypertext community might assume, including several social and legal issues that stem from preservation."

This model translates the functions and concepts defined in the OAIS Reference Model into services, interfaces, resources and human competencies. It structures the archive into three largely autonomous services: data collection and preparation, longterm storage, and finally data management and dissemination. This paper will analyse the detailed characteristics of these three services and the human competencies required to implement them. The model in question can be used by institutions responsible for national assets, whose main function is to preserve the data sent to them for safekeeping.

An overview of existing approaches to digital preservation related to shape modeling is presented and corresponding problems are considered. We propose a new digital preservation paradigm based on both constructive modeling reflecting the logical structure of the objects and open standards and procedures. Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) and Function Representation (FRep) are examined and practically applied as mathematical representations producing compressed yet precise data structures, thus providing inter-operability between current and future computer platforms crucial to archiving. Examples of CSG reconstruction of historical temples and FRep modeling of traditional lacquer ware are given. We examine the application of fitting of a parameterized FRep model to a cloud of data points as a step towards automation of the modeling process. Virtual venues for public access to cultural heritage objects including real time interactive simulation of cultural heritage sites over the Web are discussed and illustrated."

We exploit the notarization paradigm and propose a mechanism for cumulative data notarization that results in a successive trust transition towards new entities, modern technologies, and refreshed data. A future relying party will have to trust only the information provided by the last notary, in order to verify the validity of the initial signature, thus eliminating any dependency on ceased entities, obsolete data, and weak old technologies. The proposed framework uses recursive XML elements so that a notarization token structure encapsulates an identical data structure containing a previous notarization token. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

E. G. Fenton,2004,Preserving content: A case study of a multi-faceted approach,"Fundamentally, preservation is about ensuring the ongoing usability of valued content. The media which convey this content to a reader-paper, microform, CD-ROM, or online product-continue to change over time. But regardless of media variation, the fundamental goal of preservation does not change; the goal remains ensuring the longevity of the content. The challenge is to ensure that there are sufficient provisions and support for the successful transition of the content from one medium to another in a way that is compatible with the goal of long-term preservation. The likelihood of meeting this challenge is increased through a multi-faceted approach implemented within an organizational framework designed to provide the necessary support for the work of preservation. JSTOR, a not-for-profit organization with a mission focused on the long-term preservation of and access to scholarly resources, provides an opportunity to examine how content preservation and media transitions can be conducted within an organizational framework designed to robustly support this work. Drawing upon her experience as the former director of JSTOR's production unit and the leader of its Electronic-Archiving Initiative, the author suggests several elements useful for preserving journal literature in various media and highlights how these elements may be combined with key organizational components in order to meet the challenges of long-term content preservation.1 The preservation components discussed include stewardship of print originals, migration of print content to digital media, and preservation of electronic publications. These components by themselves, however, are insufficient to ensure the preservation of content; they will lead to preservation only when developed within an organizational context which includes an institutional commitment to the preservation goal; a business model which can ensure the sustainability of the archival operation; a technical infrastructure able to meet the demands of the content; and appropriate relationships with libraries and content owners and producers."

H. Van Wijngaarden; E. Oltmans,2004,Digital preservation and permanent access: The UVC for images,"Since early 2003, the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB) maintains a deposit service called e-Depot, based on the IBM product DIAS (Digital Information and Archiving System). By using this service, the KB has developed a workflow for archiving electronic publications and has implemented the other parts of the infrastructure in which the deposit system is embedded. Now that the infrastructure is in place and the service is operational, new plans and projects have started to technically and functionally extend the e-Depot. These include the development and implementation of a Preservation Manager, tools for permanent access to digital objects, and a new project that addresses massive storage and preservation of TIFF-images, delivered by museums and other cultural institutions. Thus, the e-Depot does not only provide a long-term solution for born-digital material (like e-journals), but for digitized objects as well. In this paper we will focus on the development and practical use of one of the permanent access tools: the Universal Virtual Computer (UVC) for images. Developed in collaboration with IBM as part of a new Preservation Subsystem for the e-Depot, the UVC may prove its value for the future rendering of images like JPEGs or TIFFs. We will explain how and why the UVC can be implemented in an operational digital archiving environment to provide permanent access; we will not elaborate on all technical details. For a fully technical description of this new approach, we refer to several articles by Raymond Lorie, the initiator of the UVC concept.5,7."

By periodically comparing preservation metadata for digital objects in a collection with a software version registry, potential object obsolescence can be detected and a notification message sent to the relevant agent. By making preservation software modules available as Web services and describing them semantically using a machine-processable ontology (OWL-S), the most appropriate preservation service(s) for each object can then be automatically discovered, composed and invoked by software agents (with optional human input at critical decision-making steps). We believe that this approach represents a significant advance towards providing a viable, cost-effective solution to the long term preservation of large-scale collections of digital objects."

J. Meyer; A. Pahwa,2004,A novel method for efficient archiving and retrieval of biomedical images using MPEG-7,"Digital archiving and efficient retrieval of radiological scans have become critical steps in contemporary medical diagnostics. Since more and more images and image sequences (single scans or video) from various modalities (CT/MRI/PET/digital X-ray) are now available in digital formats (e.g., DICOM-3), hospitals and radiology clinics need to implement efficient protocols capable of managing the enormous amounts of data generated daily in a typical clinical routine. We present a method that appears to be a viable way to eliminate the tedious step of manually annotating image and video material for database indexing. MPEG-7 is a new framework that standardizes the way images are characterized in terms of color, shape, and other abstract, content-related criteria. A set of standardized descriptors that are automatically generated from an image is used to compare an image to other images in a database, and to compute the distance between two images for a given application domain. Text-based database queries can be replaced with image-based queries using MPEG-7. Consequently, image queries can be conducted without any prior knowledge of the keys that were used as indices in the database. Since the decoding and matching steps are not part of the MPEG-7 standard, this method also enables searches that were not planned by the time the keys were generated."

JPEG2000 allows archivists to preserve culturally significant digital objects using lossless compression while making the collection more accessible to a wider audience. From a single master JPEG2000 image, one can extract a highly compressed image for transmission and display it in a web browser. The layered file format supports extracting any desired image size or quality. Tiling, Progressive Display, and Client-Side Region of Interest can be combined to provide for effective viewing of archive-quality files over a limited bandwidth. Compliance with an ISO standard and embedded support for multiple types of metadata each help ensure that the archive content outlives the systems that created it.

K. Devlin; A. Chalmers; E. Reinhard,2004,Displaying digitally archived images,"In the area of cultural heritage, images - photographic, scanned, or computer-generated - are often used as virtual representations of real artefacts or scenes. For these images to be authoritative, they should be a faithful representation of the original object. To interpret these images, they must be displayed. The conditions under which an image is displayed can adversely affect its appearance, so care must be taken to ensure that the user sees the end product in the way that it was intended to look. However, in digital image archiving, perceptual fidelity between the stored image and the displayed image is desirable, regardless of the medium of display or the environment in which it is exhibited, but this requires careful consideration of such diverse factors as tone and color reproduction, display device specifications and physical viewing conditions, which all contribute towards the final displayed image that the user perceives. This paper summarises the issues concerning display quality control for digital archiving."

Conservation of the physical artifact of a copyrighted work presents no significant legal impediments, but any preservation that requires making a copy of a copyrighted work may infringe the rights of the copyright holder. Increasingly, libraries are turning to digital preservation both for analog works and naturally to works originally published in digital format. The Copyright Act of 1976 contains three subsections that deal with library preservation, but each has significant requirements libraries must meet and restrictions that may limit the library's making the preserved work available to the public. The law does not serve the public's interest in preservation of the cultural record which should be at least as important as protecting the economic rights of the copyright holder."

In particular, libraries need a preservation strategy for digital objects, since digitization alone provides access but not preservation. The digital library community is also focusing on the problem of designing and implementing long-term archives or repositories. Digital repository management includes the development and enforcement of policies for tasks such as managing access to collection contents and preserving items in the collection. Comprehensive standards and best practices are currently starting to emerge, and ongoing work has deepened the understanding of the needs and requirements that must be met to carry out effective digital preservation. One of these requirements is the creation and maintenance of metadata in support of the preservation process. This paper would like to share findings from earlier and ongoing work that serve as “groundwork” for the current directions leading to the idea of making metadata a more useful and powerful tool to contribute to the technical solution of digital preservation. © 2004, "

N. J. Shih; C. Y. Lin; C. Y. Liau,2004,A 3D Information System for the Digital Preservation of Historical Architecture,"The purpose of this study is to build 3D models for the digital preservation of Chinese architecture. A historical architecture, the main hall of the Pao-An Temple, was scanned with a long-range 3D laser scanner. This temple is 19.68 meters wide, 18.2 meters wide, and 15.7 meters high. In total, the exterior and interior were registered into 1958 scans in order to cover the main hall. Scanned point clouds were converted into 3D computer models, sections, and boundary projections. Digital models were used as references for chronological records and comparison. Scanned components included the roof ridge, wood structure, dragon column, and a hanging flower. This research, which was sponsored by the National Science Council, created a two-way construction process, integrated geometric and image data, and established a digital reservation work process. Web pages were made to display 3D color components by using a plug-in to enable browsing of large files. © 2004, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

This is particularly true in the case of digital media such as DVD and CD where a sufficient number of errors may render the disc unreadable. This paper describes an initial stability study of commercially available recordable DVD and CD media using accelerated aging tests under conditions of increased temperature and humidity. The effect of prolonged exposure to direct light is also investigated and shown to have an effect on the error rates of the media. Initial results show that high quality optical media have very stable characteristics and may be suitable for long-term storage applications. However, results also indicate that significant differences exist in the stability of recordable optical media from different manufacturers."

However, systematic collecting did not begin until the 1950s. Collections of animal sound recordings serve many uses in education, entertainment, science and nature conservation. In recent years, technological developments have transformed the ways in which sounds can be sampled, stored and accessed. Now the Largest collections between them hold altogether around 0.5 million recordings with their associated data. The functioning of a major archive will be described with reference to the British Library Sound Archive. Preserving large collections for the long term is a primary concern in the digital age. While digitization and digital preservation has many advantages over analogue methods, the rate of technology change and lack of standardization are a serious problem for the world's major audio archives. Another challenge is to make collections more easily and widely accessible via electronic networks. On-line catalogues and access to the actual sounds via the internet are already available for some collections. Case studies describing the establishment and functioning of sound libraries in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil are given in individually authored sections in an Appendix."

Large collections of such manually mounted cryosections are available for digital archiving. Scanning these slices at high resolution helps preserving them for future generations. The obtained data can also be used to restore the original shape of the specimen, i.e., to create a three-dimensional model. This task usually requires time-consuming individual alignment of the slices. We present a framework that uses a pipelining approach to aid in the alignment process of a large data set, and to automate most of the steps."
R. Van Horik; H. Koppelaar; K. Van Der Meer; P.

Durable high quality digital master images available today enable the creation of specific derivatives in the future. As historical photographs often are very vulnerable and the conversion process is expensive, the creation of high quality digital master images is important. This paper presents three building blocks that can be used to realize a situation in which high quality digital surrogates of historical photographs are accessible and usable in the long run. The first building block for digital preservation is the application of a standardized image file format. This building block is based on the assumption that standards can be considered as durable. The second building block concerns the storage of the bit stream that makes up the digital surrogate in a durable data format. It is assumed that the XML data format as a non-proprietary data-encoding standard facilitates digital longevity. The third building block takes the creation of preservation metadata into consideration and is based on the assumption that metadata of digital objects is essential to understand and process the objects in the future."

This allows one to ascertain the effects of undertaken preservation action on archival records. Test-bed is researching three different approaches to long-term digital preservation: migration, XML and emulation. Not only will the effectiveness of each approach be evaluated, but also their limits, costs and application potential. Experiments take place on four different record types: text documents, spreadsheets, emails and databases of different size, complexity and nature. At the end of 2003 the digital preservation test-bed project was to provide: advice on how to deal with current digital records, recommendations for an appropriate preservation approach or a combination of approaches per record type, functional requirements for a preservation function, cost models of the various preservation strategies, a decision model to select the right preservation strategy, and recommendations concerning archival guidelines and regulations. © 2004, .

R. Wright,2004,"Digital preservation of audio, video and film","Digitisation is used for preservation of audiovisual material. This preservation work is a major producer of digital collections – which then need digital preservation for sustainability. EC Project Presto surveyed the holdings and status of ten major broadcast archives – a significant portion of total European broadcast archives, including some of the largest individual collections. The main findings are that approximately 75 per cent of this material is at risk or inaccessible and that the collections are growing at roughly four times the rate of current progress in preservation work. This paper gives further results of the project, and gives practical guidance for preservation of audiovisual material. Presto demonstrated the effectiveness of the “preservation factory” concept for major broadcast archives – a way to reduce cost while still maintaining or even increasing quality. There is now a new EC project, Presto-space, which will make the preservation factory available to small and medium-sized collections. © 2004, . All rights reserved."

S. C. Biswas,2004,Access versus preservation of library collections in a hybrid environment: Is digitization the right solution?,"Historically, library collections have served four basic purposes: dispensing, bibliographic, preservation and symbolic. All these purposes change in character with digital and hybrid (i.e., both print and digital) collections. Highlights the situations that a library manager faces in his/her endeavour to provide access to and preservation of library collections in a hybrid environment consisting of both print and digital documents, especially when he/she has to make a trade-off between the two. Digitization is often proposed as an alternative method of preservation of print and other media, because it is excellent for access, But, notwithstanding many advances in relevant technologies, digitisation is poor for preservation due to technical, economic, and legal constraints. Concludes that a hybrid library, containing digital documents and pointers to non-digital documents, is the most feasible digital library at present times."
S. Chapman; S. L. Abrams,2004,"Steering resources to safe-harbor repositories: The need for reliable, accurate and affordable ingest services","With the emergence of centralized, large-scale digital archives, geography becomes a key factor in the preservation of cultural heritage materials. Objects inside"" archives will be actively monitored and managed, whereas those ""outside"" will be at greater risk of loss and obsolescence. Developing ingest systems and services to process, package and transport objects into managed safe-harbor repositories is an immediate need.1 Standards, frameworks, and business models for digital archiving must also evolve in due time to support these services. Ingest solutions must address a range of challenges: legal, technical, and financial. Software development, however, is a logical starting point, since tools that automate pre-archiving tasks meet technical requirements for viability and economic ones for affordability. The key tasks to automate are production of preservation metadata, transformation and validation of formats, and creation of repository-compliant transfer packages. The Harvard University Library (HUL) Office for Information Systems (OIS) has developed two applications to promote use of the HUL Digital Repository Service. JHOVE, developed with JSTOR, is a format-validation program; Dmart is a batch deposit tool for audio preservation packages. In Harvard's experience, the target user for such applications has typically been a professional depositing agent with technical expertise, who consults as needed with curatorial experts. With greater understanding of ingest requirements, and the profiles of persons or agencies likely to perform these services, it is hoped that industry will develop and support tools for the digital archiving market."""

The format, thus opted for conversion, may be latest and the life of the source will be longer than the previous format, The most reliable format is digital format and stored in the CD or DVD and the same can be played in CD player or computer."
S. Kriegsman; L.

Unfortunately digital preservation is not something enough people have considered as an aspect of emerging imaging technology. Not all data, or digital images in this particular instance, should be saved far into the future but those worth maintaining need more consideration than they are getting now. The problems of digital preservation will have an impact on the development of imaging science and technology, and learning about digital preservation is the first step in being able to achieve preservation goals. There are four primary communities who will be most affected by digital preservation: industry, digital labs, home consumers and collection managers. Acknowledging the relationships and points of interaction between the communities will facilitate preservation activities. There are basic concepts that can be put into practice now to help maintain digital images and foster ongoing research. All four communities must recognize the pivotal roll education plays in long term digital preservation."
S. L. Abrams,2004,The role of format in digital preservation,"The concept of representation format permeates all technical aspects of digital repository architecture and is, therefore, the foundation of many, if not all, digital preservation activities. Digital formats need to be understood both as general classes of encodings and in the specific instances of digital objects. The Digital Library Foundation (DLF) has sponsored an initial investigation into the creation of a global digital format registry (GDRF) to maintain format representation information. Using such information, ancillary tools and services can be created for additional repository and preservation-related functions such as format-specific object identification, validation, and characterization. JSTOR and the Harvard University Library are cooperating on the development of an extensible format validation framework called JHOVE. This paper introduces both the GDFR and JHOVE projects. © 2004, . All rights reserved."

S. L. Abrams; S. P. Levenson,2004,PDF/A: An electronic document file format for long-term preservation,"PDF has emerged as one of the predominant formats for creating, capturing, storing, and delivering electronic documents. As it is increasingly applied to content deserving or requiring long-term retention, questions arise as to what technical mechanisms and best practices can ensure effective preservation. Long-term preservation entails not merely maintaining the fixity of the byte stream, but also ensuring continuing access to, and interpretation of, the full information content of archived PDF documents. PDF supports many sophisticated features that tend to subvert efforts towards effective preservation. To address these concerns the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established a joint working group to develop a standard to specify how to use PDF for long-term preservation of electronic documents. ISO 19005-1, known familiarly as PDF/A, defines a constrained subset of the file format and a set of functional requirements for PDF/A readers. This paper provides a snapshot of the evolving PDF/A standard and addresses its potential impact for digital preservation."
S. Mao; G. R. Thoma,2004,Bayesian learning of 2D document layout models for preservation metadata extraction,"Digital preservation addresses the storage, maintainance, accessibility, and technical integrity of digital materials over the long term. Preservation metadata is the information required to perform these tasks. Given the volume of these journals and high labor cost of manual metadata entry, automated metadata extraction is necessary. Document layout analysis is a process of partitioning document images into hierarchically structured and labeled homogeneous physical regions. Descriptive metadata such as bibliographic information can then be extracted from these segmented and labeled regions using OCR. While numerous algorithms have been proposed for document layout analysis, most of them require manually specified rules or models. In this paper, we first define the hierarchical 2D layout model of document pages as a set of attributed hidden semi-Markov Models (HSMM). Each attributed HSMM represents the projection profile of the character bounding boxes in a physical region on either the X or Y axis. We then describe a Bayesian-based method to leam 2D layout models from the unstructured and labeled physical regions in a set of training pages. We compare the zoning and labeling performance of the learned HSMM-based model, a learned baseline model, and two rule-based systems on 69 test pages and show that the HSMM-based model has the best overall performance, and comparable or better performance for individual fields."
S. Mao; J. W. Kim; G. R. Thoma,2004,A Dynamic Feature Generation System for Automated Metadata Extraction in Preservation of Digital Materials,"Obsolescence in storage media and the hardware and software for access and use can render old electronic files inaccessible and unusable. Therefore, the long-term preservation of digital materials has become an active area of research. At the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), we are investigating the preservation of scanned and online medical journal articles, though other data types (e.g., video sequences) are also of interest. Metadata of different types have been proposed to save the information needed to preserve digital materials. Given the ever-increasing volume of medical journals and high labor cost of manual data entry, automated metadata extraction is crucial. A system has been developed at NLM to automatically generate descriptive metadata that includes title, author, affiliation, and abstract from scanned medical journals. A module called ZoneMatch is used to generate geometric and contextual features from a set of issues of each journal. A rule-based labeling module (called ZoneCzar) then uses these features to perform labeling independent of journal layout styles. However, if there are significant style variations among the issues of a same journal, the features generated from one set of journal issues may not be very useful to label a different set. In this paper, we describe a dynamic feature updating system in which the features used for labeling a current journal issue are generated from previous issues with similar layout style. This new system can adapt to possible style variations among different issues of the same journal. Experimental results presented show that the new system delivers improved labeling performance accuracy."

S. Thomas; D. Yakimischak,2004,High resolution image compositing as a solution for long-term preservation,"JSTOR, a non-profit archive of academic journals, selected a 600 DPI bitonal TIFF G4 image format as its long-term digital preservation standard. This provided for very clean and crisp text and line-art. Accurate imaging of text is important because we OCR the textual material to provide access to the journals via our search engine. Because of the significance of images in some of the new journals we were considering adding to the JSTOR archive, we were faced with the need to include high resolution grayscale and color images. Rather than move to full-page color imaging, JSTOR decided to retain the bitonal TIFF images as its preservation standard for text and line-art content, and to scan grayscale and color images separately as 8- or 24-bit TIFF files. At delivery time, we then composite (or paste"") the deeper images over the bitonal scans, in order to deliver the best combination of text and image resolutions. We arrived at this decision by considering the intended use of each of the various page components and chose the storage and delivery formats that would best serve those uses. This article discusses the background, problem description, solutions, implementation and experience to date from this recent JSTOR development."""

To realize easy and high quality digitization of documents and photographs, we propose a novel digitization method that uses a movie captured by a hand-held camera. In our method, first, 6-DOF(Degree Of Freedom) position and posture parameters of the mobile camera are estimated in each frame by tracking image features automatically. Next, re-appearing feature points in the image sequence are detected and stitched for minimizing accumulated estimation errors. Finally, all the images are merged as a high-resolution mosaic image using the optimized parameters. Experiments have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method. Our prototype system can acquire initial estimates of extrinsic camera parameters in real-time with capturing images."

Particularly for dance motions, we think these primitives must be synchronized to the musical rhythm. In this paper, we introduce musical information for motion structure analysis.

The volume of data produced by such technology is so large that it cannot be read"" using traditional film-based methods, and once in digital form, it creates a massive data integration and archiving challenge. Despite the benefits of digital imaging and archiving, there are several key challenges that healthcare organizations should consider in planning, selecting, and implementing the information technology (IT) infrastructure to support digital imaging. Decisions about storage and image distribution are essentially questions of ""where"" and ""how fast."" When planning the digital archiving infrastructure, organizations should think about where they want to store and distribute their images. This is similar to decisions that organizations have to make in regard to physical film storage and distribution, except the portability of images is even greater in a digital environment. The principle of ""network effects"" seems like a simple concept, yet the effect is not always considered when implementing a technology plan. To fully realize the benefits of digital imaging, the radiology department must integrate the archiving solutions throughout the department and, ultimately, with applications across other departments and enterprises. Medical institutions can derive a number of benefits from implementing digital imaging and archiving solutions like PACS. Hospitals and imaging centers can use the transition from film-based imaging as a foundational opportunity to reduce costs, increase competitive advantage, attract talent, and improve service to patients. The key factors in achieving these goals include attention to the means of data storage, distribution and protection."""

A. Japzon; N. Anderson,2005,Wallops Island Balloon technology: Can't see the repository for the documents,"Since the Wallop's Balloon Technology documents repository began approximately 9 years ago, the Goddard Library has become increasingly involved in developing digital archiving capabilities. The Library developed the Digital Archiving System (DAS) which is a prototype infrastructure for creating a combined metadata repository that allows metadata for heterogeneous digital objects to be searched with a single search mechanism and presented in a single results page. With this, the opportunity has been presented to expand the usability of the print repository. The Balloon Technology documents relate only to the specific subject of construction of scientific balloons and at the current time number over 4,300. The documents exist primarily in paper format and are organized according to the accession number. The project is currently at a crossroads where decisions will have to be made regarding the reorganization of the database from many different perspectives. An assessment of the project was conducted to determine future direction. An assessment survey was created using the Knowledge Management Assessment Tool (KMAT) from the American Productivity & Quality Center and from the recommendations that The Scholarly Publishing & Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) put forth in The Case for Institutional Repositories: A SPARC Position Paper. Survey participants agreed to move forward with project by scanning the documents, mapping existing database records to the current metaclata elements, seeking copyright permissions, and forming a joint committee of balloon scientists and librarians. All have agreed on the importance of digitizing this collection to the balloon science community. Further, it was agreed that once complete, the addition of the balloon documents to the DAS (an institutional repository) could serve as a model for other NASA and/or government projects trying to organize, collect and preserve specialized knowledge that manifests largely in grey literature."""

JPEG 2000 has many features for archiving and distribution such as: encode once; decode many"" flexibility, optimized network transfer, and extensibility to other imaging applications such as document imaging, intra-frame video, low-delay real-time video, and more. We will discuss a case study in document imaging and low-delay real-time video forming a basis for a unified archiving and distribution system. A case study is presented for a Japanese newspaper company utilizing JPEG 2000 in their internal workflow to archive, distribute, and work more effectively. The next step is to utilize JPEG 2000 as the format to archive and distribute video. In this paper, Arch-BEAM, is introduced in detail. Arch-BEAM system is a complete: capture, encode, storage, and delivery system for real-time or on-demand streaming video. Arch-BEAM also has real-time quality of service technology for efficient bandwidth utilization, real-time error control and recovery. From Arch-BEAM, a new concept of real-time archiving and scalable distribution for video is introduced. The Arch-BEAM system allows one to monitor the capture in real time and at the same time to archive the master and distribute various lower resolutions for various clients over various networks. With more organizations adopting JPEG 2000 as a standard format of their own, interchange between organizations will be easier and support between them will multiply with enhanced resources. To simplify workflows and technical support, using JPEG 2000 is the best choice for not only from an archive point of view but for distribution as well. Adoption of JPEG 2000 in archiving will bring digital archiving and distribution to a new level."""

A. Stanescu,2005,Assessing the durability of formats in a digital preservation environment: The INFORM methodology,"Purpose - To describe INFORM, a new methodology for investigating and measuring the risk factors of digital formats and providing guidelines for preservation action plans. Design/methodology/approach - Construction of a model which aims to discover specific threats to preservation and measure their possible impact on preservation decisions. The methodology defines: risk categories of digital formats and their dependencies; risk factors for each category; scales to measure probability of occurrence and impact; and methods to collect, report and interpret the results. Findings - While individuals are biased and subjective in their aversion to risk, collating the assessments of many individuals should generate group-consensus or group-averaged objective results. Hence, preservation plans can be based on objective analysis of risk trends instead of individuals' opinions developed in the relative isolation of their institutions. The methodology takes into consideration individuals' aversion to risk, therefore refraining from imposing specific courses of action, but simply making suggestions of possible actions. Research limitations/implications - A comprehensive approach to the format assessment must also consider, in addition to the risk factors, two other considerations, reflecting the quality of the digital format specification: significant properties of the format under consideration; the features of the format as defined in the format specification. These two aspects will be defined at a later time. Practical implications - Digital archives, institutional repositories and digital libraries can take advantage of the measurements offered by the INFORM method to select digital formats most apt for long-term viability. Moreover, by repeating the process, involved parties can detect changes in the threat model over time, to which digital collections managers can act accordingly. Originality/value - Risk management has been previously used to detect the potential of loss of web resources and has been inspirational to this author. However, this method is the first to use risk factors to measure digital preservation viability of digital formats. The results of the measurements described here can be used by: content creators and publishers, to suggest best formats to use; content curators, to restrict what is collected; content managers, to know in advance how difficult to handle a certain collection may be; and preservation planners, to define and implement preservation plans, in the form of either, migration strategies or short-term emulation solutions. © 2005 OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc."

F. L. Walker; G. R. Thoma,2005,Image preservation through PDF/A,"The preservation of image collections is a goal of many libraries and organizations. Among the considerations for long-term preservation is the choice of file format. An emerging file format for preservation is PDF/A, which is a proposed international standard for long-term electronic document preservation. Since this file format can be used for image preservation, there are a number of considerations to be followed for converting image files to PDF/A, and also for ultimately migrating from PDF/A to successor file formats. As a result of research and development in electronic document delivery and file conversion, an Internet-based file migration system called MyMorph has been created at the National Library of Medicine. MyMorph was developed as a file migration service that allows the bulk conversion of electronic documents to PDF in a manner that minimizes certain aspects of the migration cost. The user interface permits file migration to proceed in batch mode, requiring minimal user interaction regardless of the number of files converted. After more than two years of use, the system is being modified to facilitate the creation of PDF/A files from source files consisting of scanned images. This paper details the design decisions for extending MyMorph to create image-based PDF/A files."

Lore,2005,Trustworthy 100-year digital objects: Durable encoding for when it's too late to ask,"How can an author store digital information so that it will be reliably intelligible, even years later when he or she is no longer available to answer questions? Methods that might work are not good enough; what is preserved today should be reliably intelligible whenever someone wants it. Prior proposals fail because they generally confound saved data with irrelevant details of today's information technology - details that are difficult to define, extract, and save completely and accurately. We use a virtual machine to represent and eventually to render any data whatsoever. We focus on a case of intermediate difficulty - an executable procedure - and identify a variant for every other data type. This solution might be more elaborate than needed to render some text, image, audio, or video data. Simple data can be preserved as representations using well-known standards. We sketch practical methods for files ranging from simple structures to those containing computer programs, treating simple cases here and deferring complex cases for future work. Enough of the complete solution is known to enable practical aggressive preservation programs today. © 2005 ACM."
H. R. Tibbo; A. Bardeen; T.

Materials must be made available in a coherent and context-rich environment that will elucidate their content and reveal their significance to researchers decades in the future. The Minds of Carolina project seeks to develop a cost-effective, decentralized, and ubiquitous approach to self-archiving and long-term preservation that directs the content creator in the development of rich, contextualizing metadata. It is currently developing tools, methodologies, and guidelines to help scholars at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill contextualize and submit their materials for archiving within a trusted digital repository at UNC. Such tools should be applicable to faculty in all institutions of higher education and adaptable to a wide variety of individuals in other professions. Now in its second phase, Minds of Carolina is developing deposit templates that will provide natural context for faculty contributions. Based on a content analysis of vitae from across campus, we are currently exploring the use of this document as the backbone of the deposit tool. Contributors will be asked to cut and paste their vitae into the template and then be prompted with contextualizing questions about the sections. The goal is for contributors to write their own finding aids"" that will provide significance for, and elucidate relationships among, the objects they contribute to their digital collection within the larger MOC repository."""

This evolution has encouraged the development of various approaches to represent complex digital objects. Approaches that are of specific relevance to the digital library and archiving community include the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS), the Content Packaging XML Binding of the Instructional Management System (IMS) project, and the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM). The MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration MPEG-21 DID) is yet another packaging approach that, so far, has received little attention in the digital library community. The primary goal of this article is to offer a method to compare these packaging approaches in the context of the needs of the digital library community and the rising digital preservation programs. The contribution of this paper is the definition of an integrated reference framework, based on both the ISO OAIS Reference Model and a set of additional significant properties that affect the quality, usability, encoding, and behavior of complex digital objects. This article also gives a brief insight into MPEG-21 DID and examines its potential relevance by showing the results obtained from applying the proposed reference framework. © Springer-Verlag 2005."

The advantage of digital publishing is obvious: immediate accessibility anywhere. Gradually a disadvantage is also becoming clear: digital publishing endangers the continuity of research information. As a consequence of the obsolescence of formats, hardware, software, and carriers, digital information will be lost unless we act. Digital publishing is also causing a shift in the roles and responsibilities of publishers and libraries concerned with archiving digital publications for future use. Archiving digital publications requires a major turnaround in the policy and practice of national libraries. Although some actions have been taken, digital preservation research and implementation are still in their infancy. National libraries will need substantial funding for venture research activities and development of archival infrastructures. They will also have to work together more closely to successfully organize digital archiving in the twenty-first century. © 2005 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois."
J. Grimard,2005,Managing the long-term preservation of electronic archives or preserving the medium and the message,"The author invites readers to reflect on the use of electronic records. He defines the term as encompassing all those records produced and accessible only by means of electronic equipment. He shows that electronic information must be maintained through a global approach that preserves both the medium and the message. He underlines the opaque nature of electronic information, which has no natural structure even though it is regulated by a range of codes and conventions; the multiplicity of formats in which it is found; and the fluidity and malleability that characterize it. He proposes three solutions to the problem of preserving the contents of electronic records: changing the medium, standardizing formats, and conversion of the information. In the third part of his paper the author examines the fragility of electronic media and the lifespan of supporting technology. As solutions to the problem of preserving the media, the author underlines the importance of storage conditions, information conversion, research, and standardization. In conclusion, he reminds readers of the importance of preserving recorded memory. To succeed, not only must the message and the medium be preserved, but early, appropriate, and timely intervention is needed."

J. Spence,2005,Small organisations and cultural institutions - A digital future?,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine how technology presents both problems and opportunities for the historian, the researcher, small organisations, and cultural heritage institutions. Ways of safeguarding historical material in digital form are suggested, and the role of cultural heritage bodies as managers of sustainable digital collections is examined. Design/methodology/approach - The tools available for online access to historical material are discussed, with some comparison made between current efforts on access provision and long-term preservation. Findings - At present, access to historical material in digital form is often given precedence over its preservation. This could have potentially serious long-term implications. Lack of funding for the traditional collecting bodies suggests that new mechanisms for dealing with digital archive collections need to be found. Managing digital material from its creation moves responsibility back to owners, but can provide a platform for effective transfer to new custodians at the appropriate time. Small organisations can participate, increasing the volume and diversity of available material, enriching the base of knowledge upon which history is created. Research limitations/implications - Further research is required into possible models to enable seamless transfer through the custodial chain. Limitation: lack of quantitative analysis of existing and planned digital preservation projects. Originality/value - The paper challenges the status quo and sets out some radical ideas concerning the creation, acquisition, management and preservation of digital records, and the roles of the key stakeholders in the cultural and historical domains. © ."

M. Ellis,2005,Establishing a research culture for Archive Administration in the UK,"This paper is concerned with the current state of academic research within the discipline of archive administration in the UK. It identifies and examines a number of reasons why research output from the UK is so low when compared with activity on an international basis. These reasons include the historic nature of archival education in the UK, the expectations of training on the part of practitioners, perceptions of the value of research and archival theory within the UK profession, and the size and capacity of the archival academic community. This is contrasted with much greater activity and debate around the issue of research in Canada, the USA and Australia. The article makes a number of suggestions for fostering greater research activity in the UK such as a mapping of the research landscape to identify need, the development of a research agenda, and the introduction of modules in research training into postgraduate courses. The profile of current research activity could be raised by, for example, the publication of abstracts of masters' dissertations. Work carried out by organisations like the National Archives into areas such as digital preservation could also be recognised as research. © 2005 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved."
M. Harris,2005,ICT and institutional change at the British Library,"The new information and communications technologies (ICTs) have stimulated a wide-ranging debate on the future of learning institutions in the age of the 'network society'.

This paper investigates the extensive programme of digitisation now under way at the British Library (BL), one of the world's largest knowledge providers and a key player in the UK research libraries network. The findings presented in the paper do not reflect the belief that the spread of global information networks will undermine the public service remit of large knowledge providers such as the BL but the evidence does show that these providers are becoming more connected to other players in the digital environment, with inherently complex, and potentially far-reaching implications for the production of knowledge in the emergent 'network society'. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd."

N. Sinha,2005,Secure embedded data schemes for user adaptive multimedia presentation,"In this Digital/Internet Age, digital multimedia holds an unlimited potential, and virtually all forms of media content, including books, video games, music and software are now available for digital distribution. Digital multimedia libraries, comprising a large amount of such digital media (the so-called Digital Intellectual Property), in the form of images, video, audio and graphics are rapidly growing. Also, due to the unprecedented growth of the World Wide Web, vast amounts of multimedia data is readily available leading to an explosion of multimedia and hypermedia database creation and sharing. Digital information embedding techniques for various types of media, for a variety of applications including digital libraries, museum cataloging, medical and healthcare industries, digital preservation systems, educational systems and personalization systems, are of significant interest in two areas. Firstly, these are useful for the realization of efficient database indexing schemes and customization, which in turn lead to efficient tools for the organization, retrieval, adaptive presentation, and distribution of digital media content. Secondly, these are useful in developing tools to protect, detect and verify ownership and/or usage rights for the Digital Intellectual Property and also the tracking of these in the distribution medium. In either of these applications, information embedding schemes which allow for a detailed level of source description, and which are robust to some of the distortions encountered in the distribution medium (e.g., JPEG compression for images), are particularly attractive. This paper presents an overview of multimedia presentation adaptation through the use of robust information descriptors and a novel information embedding technique for digital images that allows for significantly higher information throughput and increased robustness compared to many of the existing techniques."

P. M. A. van Ooijen; P. J. M. ten Bhomer; M. Oudkerk,2005,PACS storage requirements - influence of changes in imaging modalities,"In current radiology departments, imaging modalities are changing rapidly. One reason for these changes is the continuous technical development providing new imaging modalities with higher spatial and temporal resolution and increased capabilities. Another important reason for change is the replacement of non-digital modalities by digital DICOM modalities to ensure easy storage into the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Besides the impact on working procedures for both radiologists and technologists, these changes in imaging modalities also influence the storage requirements of the PACS. In the University Hospital Groningen, digital archiving of imaging data started late 1999. From this time on, monthly production figures were collected from different modality types and the dates of changes in imaging modalities were recorded. Our results show that increase in data production is not limited to the recent advancement of multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT), but also new ultrasound (US) devices, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X-ray angiography (XA) could have major impact on the storage capacity requirements. Our measurements show that PACS storage capacity planning should take into account a large margin for growth because of image modality replacement. (c) 2005 CARS & Elsevier B.V.

We identify two basic approaches to address the problem of digital preservation using peer-to-peer systems: conservation and consensus. We highlight the design tradeoffs involved in using the two general approaches, and we provide a framework for analyzing the characteristics of peer-to-peer preservation systems in general.

R. A. Lorie; R. J. Van Diessen,2005,Long-term preservation of complex processes,"A sequence of bits ingested, say, in 2005, is meaningless in 2055 if it cannot be interpreted at that time to produce the same essential information that was available to a 2005 user. Such an interpretation requires a program (a format interpreter). In a method initially proposed in Refs. 1 through 3, the format interpreter is written, in 2005, for a Universal Virtual Computer (UVC) that can be easily emulated in the future. A current implementation of the UVC exists and interpreters have been written for a variety of formats including JPEG and GIF, and (partially) Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, and PDF. However, these applications only handle static features of the formats and do not involve general interaction with the outside world. The purpose of this paper is to show how the UVC method can preserve more complex objects by exploiting its communication facility (between the UVC program and a new 2055 application). If the format interpreter needs some input, it communicates with the new application program which interacts with the outside world in a way en vogue in the future. Since the new application can receive parameters from the user and transfer them to the UVC program, the latter can compute new results, therefore supporting dynamic objects. To capitalize on the fact that the whole functionality of the original application can potentially be executed on the UVC, it is important to think about how existing code can be transferred to the UVC with a minimal effort. The involvement of format owners may be the key to success."
R. Guenther; S. C. I. Soc Imaging; Technol,2005,PRIEservation metadata: Implementation strategies,"PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies, or PREMIS, is an activity jointly sponsored by OCLC and RLG, focusing on issues associated with implementing preservation metadata in digital archiving systems. It was established to develop a common, implementable core set of metadata elements for digital preservation, since most published specifications for preservation-related metadata are either implementation-specific or broadly theoretical. PREMIS is composed of nearly 30 international experts representing national and university libraries, museums, archives, government agencies, and the private sector. PREMIS was charged to define a set of semantic units that are implementation-independent, practically-oriented, and likely to be needed by most preservation repositories as well as to identify and evaluate alternative strategies for encoding, storing, managing, and exchanging the core elements within a digital archiving system.Initiated in June 2003, PREMIS will conclude its activities in early 2005. This paper will report on the findings and conclusions of the PREMIS working group. The deliverables of the group consist of a survey of existing preservation repositories, a final report, and a data dictionary.As part of the PREMIS work, existing preservation repositories were surveyed about their architectural models and metadata practices. This paper will summarize the results of this survey which addressed the mission, policy, economic, and technical aspects of digital repositories, as well as current practices for creating, managing, and maintaining preservation metadata within the repository environment. Analysis of the survey responses suggests that the digital preservation community is beginning to coalesce around several emerging trends and best practices in the use and management of preservation metadata, which will be enumerated.The second deliverable of the group is a data dictionary and final report. The semantic units that support long term preservation are represented in a data dictionary with implementation details and in METS-compatible XML schemas. In the course of this work, the group also developed a glossary of terms and concepts, a data model, and a typology of relationships. The paper will discuss the data model as well as key issues that arose in the consensus-building process during the development of the data dictionary.The PREMIS working group report and data dictionary will be issued in March 2005, with the XML schemas to follow shortly thereafter. In addition to providing the data dictionary and accompanying documentation, the paper will also suggest follow-on activities to test the PREMIS data element set."

Digital repositories should be able to preserve electronic materials for periods at least comparable to existing preservation methods. Modern computing technology in general is barely fifty years old and few of us have seen or used digital objects that are more than ten years old. While traditional preservation practices are comparatively well-developed, lack of experience and lack of consensus raise some questions about how we should proceed with digital-based preservation processes. Can we preserve a digital object for at least one-hundred years? Can we answer questions such as Is this object the digital original""? or ""How old is this digital object""? What does it mean to be a trusted repository of digital materials? A basic premise of this article is that there are many technologies available today that will help us build trust in a digital preservation process and that these technologies can be readily integrated into an operational digital preservation framework."""

Although tremendous work has been undertaken in defining the problems and challenges, much more remains to be done, and the tough task of actually doing digital preservation (and digital rescue) remains ahead.""[1] Many institutions internationally have begun this ""tough task"" and are beginning to build preservation repositories for their own communities. To mention only a few, the Koninklijke Bibliotheek's eDepot and the JSTOR Electronic Archiving initiative are both tackling the problems of archiving electronic journals; the Internet Archive and the Library of Congress"" Minerva Project are capturing websites; Australia's PANDORA Archive preserves documentary resources of Australia. Other initiatives target federal or state government publications, electronic records, science and social science research data, media art, television broadcasts, and other special genres and formats. Despite these efforts, the field of digital preservation is in its infancy, and answers to many fundamental questions are not selfevident. Is digital preservation even possible, given the ephemerality of formats and platforms, the magnitude of investment required, and the early state of preservation research? Can you have preservation without access? Are distributed grassroots efforts or coordinated top-down programs more likely to succeed? This panel brings together representatives from four current digital preservation initiatives in libraries and archives to consider these questions and more. Panelists will be asked to describe their own initiatives and explain why they believe their own efforts will succeed. The Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) is a not-for profit library cooperative with an international membership. The OCLC Digital Archive is a fee-based service available to any cultural heritage institution.

The Florida Center for Library Automation is a state center serving the libraries of the public universities of Florida. The FCLA Digital Archive will begin operation this year, with the directors of the eleven university libraries serving as the Advisory Board. It will focus on electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) and other born-digital intellectual property.

A. Boyko; B. Hamidzadeh; J. Littman,2006,A framework for object preservation in digital repositories,"The term digital repository"" is used in disparate contexts, in both in a formal sense to describe a complex and complete preservation system and its policies, and in a more intuitive but less clearly defined sense, often implying simply a robust storage system, or a content management system. Lack of formalism in use of this term can impede development of formal requirements for building specific repository systems and, consequently, the widespread use of such systems. On the other hand, the complexity of a formal, system-wide view can impede understanding and implementation in many environments. To attempt to reconcile these concerns, we present a pragmatic definition and scope for digital repositories (systems whose primary function is the long-term preservation of digital objects). Taking a ""bottom-up"" approach that builds abstractions on top of reliable storage systems, we establish a minimal general vocabulary for the expression of digital objects, independent of policy, in the form of a low-level content model. We show that the "" primitives"" supplied by this vocabulary can be used to express the particular content and metadata models for several disparate repository case studies."""

Design/methodology/approach - Critically analyses the principles of computer forensics in the context of records characteristics - authenticity, reliability, integrity and usability - and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) principles and procedures for the collection of digital evidence. Findings - The disciplines of records management and computer forensics are potentially mutually compatible. Computer forensics allows for identification of incidents, gathering of evidence, analysis of evidence and potentially recovery of records. Records managers can utilise computer forensics principles to positively enhance records management and have valuable knowledge and expertise to share with their computer forensics colleagues; e.g. metadata expertise, functional requirements for electronic records management, recordkeeping systems design and implementation methodologies, digital preservation and retention management. Research limitations/implications - Discusses how computer forensics can be used to highlight inadequate recordkeeping and provide a different perspective on records management based on an analysis of principles and concepts rather than empirical data. Practical implications - Highlights the need for records managers to understand computer forensics and computer forensic scientists to understand recordkeeping to support better records management in the electronic environment; raises the implications for educators, trainers and professional societies.

A.

From this perspective, the necessity for adequate, well-managed and high quality Metadata is becoming increasingly essential for successful long-term high quality data preservation. Metadata's assistance in reconstruction or accessibility of preserved data, however, bears the same predicament as that of the efficient use of digital information over time: long-term metadata quality and integrity assurance notwithstanding the rapid evolvements of metadata formats and related technology. Therefore, in order to ascertain the overall quality and integrity of metadata over a sustained period of time, thereby assisting in successful long-term digital preservation, effective long-term metadata curation is indispensable. This paper presents an approach to long-term metadata curation, which involves a provisional specification of the core requirements of long-term metadata curation. In addition, the paper introduces Metadata Curation Record"", expressed in the form of an XML Schema, which essentially captures additional statements about both data objects and associated metadata to aid long-term digital curation. The paper also presents a metadata schema mapping/migration tool, which may be regarded as a fundamental stride towards an efficient and curation-aware metadata migration strategy."""
A. Stanescu; J. Cobb; T. Surface,2006,Rip - mix - burn: Why content repurposing is the answer to digital preservation,"Traditional preservation arguments focused on two technological options, emulation [4, 5] and format conversion [1, 2, 3] or a combination of both [6]. All provide solutions to some preservation scenarios but also list limitations of scalability [3] and unsustainable loss [7], respectively, a common belief which led us to employ a procedural hybrid focused on access and usage, incorporating migration on access advantages described by LOCKSS [3]. This strategy is based on the philosophy that any preservation action made directly to the original digital objects must be postponed until absolutely necessary, arguably forever. However, access is given immediately by employing current-era rendering programs and translating to current-era digital formats which are sufficiently-featured to fully represent the intellectual content in need of preservation. Therefore, we will argue that access, to mix and remix digital content, generates sufficient and necessary incentives [8, 15] to extend the life of digital objects, and indirectly that of digital formats, for as long as they are relevant to some user subgroup. Additionally, we will introduce assessment and measurement processes complementing the Rosenthal's LOCKSS model. We will develop the main argument by showing the relationships between the three distinct classes of costs incurred by any preservation program. We will show how INFORM methodology [10] is used to time the selection of new programs and formats. Lastly, we will show how translation loss can be measured, managed and validated, by employing a process built on the project at the Library of Congress to analyze the sustainability of digital formats [111]."

B. Pymm,2006,Building collections for all time: The issue of significance,"One of the major roles adopted by libraries is the long-term preservation of selected material within their collections. Traditionally, this role comprised identifying individual physical objects or collections based upon the library’s own view of its role and the significance of items in its collections. With the rapid growth of digital materials there has been a blurring of the divide between museum, archive and library collections, with a growing concern amongst all cultural heritage sectors about the identification and ongoing preservation of digital objects. Due to the size and complexity of the issues and, in particular, the volume of digital material and costs involved in its long-term preservation, there has been a resurgence in the debate on identifying significance in materials and thus their priority in preservation programs. This debate has sparked widespread discussion in the museum, archives and recordkeeping professions which can inform the more recent concerns now being voiced within librarianship.

B. Sutradhar,2006,Design and development of an institutional repository at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur,"Purpose - To describe how an institutional repository (IR) was set up, using open source software, at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Kharagpur. Members of the IIT can publish their research documents in the IR for online access as well as digital preservation. Material in this IR includes instructional materials, records, data sets, electronic theses, dissertations, annual reports, as well as published papers. This opens up the world of scholarly publishing in a way that causes re-examination of many of the current practices of scholarly communication and publishing. Design/methodology/approach - Details of the hardware and software requirements are provided along with information about available open source software. The steps involved in uploading and submitting material in the IR are described. Findings - This paper provides evidence on how to set up an IR and how to create different communities and, under each community, many collections using the DSpace software. It was found that setting up an IR is very simple but its maintenance is very difficult. One person needs to have the computer knowledge, particularly in the Linux operating system environment and must be dedicated to carry out the IR administrative activities like registration, permission authenticity, submission and grant, installation of the updating version of the software, etc. Research limitations/implications - Before setting up an IR, the institution should have sufficient funds to acquire computer hardware and other related software, and computer knowledgeable manpower. It can also be noted that after setting up a successful IR, the administrator must train the faculty members and research scholars regarding the proper uploading and submitting of metadata into the repository. Practical implications - Guidelines are provided to assist those in setting up an IR. Appropriate staff are required to administer and run the IR smoothly. Originality/value - An IR provides the IIT with a central and cost-effective facility for the orderly and systematic archiving of research results and other documents that is accessible worldwide. Eventually, the library hopes to build a full IR, and make the resource available to other sites using a data harvesting protocol like OAI-PMH. This paper gives an idea that setting set up interoperable IRs among the same type of institutions in a particular state or country enables data to be transferred through OAI-PMH protocol from one IR to another. © ."
C. A. Lee; H. R. Tibbo; D. Howard; Y. Song; T. Russell; P. Jones,2006,Keeping the context: An investigation in preserving collections of digital video,"There has been a recent dramatic shift from analog to digital creation, management and use of video, creating unprecedented opportunities to develop rich, interactive collections, but without proper care, much of this digital video could be inaccessible or incomprehensible in the future. Several projects have explored technical challenges and potential strategies for ensuring long-term access to digital video collections. A number of initiatives have also generated sets of proposed metadata for digital video. Most of the above activities have focused on ensuring that videos can be discovered, accessed and rendered over time. Another active steam of research has examined how users can best navigate, understand, view, interact with and annotate collections of digital video. This research has generated valuable lessons, tools and observations to support current users. However, it has generally not investigated how the components of a digital video collection might support or fail to support future users of videos. The Preserving Video Objects and Context (VidArch) project - NSF Grant # US 0455970, involving the authors, Gary Marchionini and Gary Geisler - lies at the intersection between the two streams of research described above. We are developing a preservation framework for digital video context. Among other issues, we are considering: Are there interface elements from current collections (e.g. surrogates, navigation aids, behaviors) that should be retained over time, in order to support long-term use and understanding of the videos? How might curators of digital video collections decide which contextual elements are important and then devise strategies for preserving them? According to the glossary of the Society of American Archivists, context is the organizational, functional, and operational circumstances surrounding materials' creation, receipt, storage, or use, and its relationship to other materials."" Documents derive value and meaning from relationships with other documents within the same collection. Rather than treating each item as a discrete entity, archival theory and practice suggests that digital videos should be managed, preserved and presented to users in a way that reflects the social and documentary context in which they were originally embedded. Access Systems for text-based collections often rely on surrogates, such as indices, catalogs, and abstracts. In addition to facilitating information navigation, discovery and retrieval, surrogates also provide valuable contextual information about the documents. In archival descriptive practices, attention to context is expressed through the creation of finding aids, which include not only inventories of the contents of collections, but also background information about the actors and activities that generated the materials, and the ways they were organized by their original creators or recipients. Recent research has produced and investigated an analogous set of surrogates for digital video collections. These include textual descriptions, title, captions, and annotations, but they also include surrogates that are themselves still or moving images: video segments, keyframes, slide shows, and fast forwards. VidArch is focused on two collections within the Open Video repository: the complete set of videos that National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) produces and broadcasts to advance learning and appreciation for science; and a set of videos of juried presentations to various annual Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conferences. The two collections reflect several forms of documentation that may be valuable to preserve in order to convey the context of the videos: text-based surrogates, image-based surrogates (story boards and fast forwards), links to related videos, use history data, and supporting documents (e.g. lesson plans). We have generated archival finding aids to the two collections in order to reflect contextual information that is not readily available within Open Video. Such documentary elements should not simply be treat d as part of the current interface to the collection but should also be considered as potential targets of long-term preservation in their own right. This poster presents an information model for digital video context and places the information model within the context of recent guidance on metadata for digital video, metadata for digital preservation, and the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)."""
C. C. Marshall; S. Bly; F. Brun-Cottan,2006,The long term fate of our digital belongings: Toward a service model for personal archives,"We conducted a preliminary field study to understand the current state of personal digital archiving in practice. Our aim is to design a service for the long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative ?efforts, and records. Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently. Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials: (2) personal storage is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate, creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats; and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies; and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked storage."

National Taiwan University created a portal web site, the Digital Archives Resource Centre (DARC), to provide the digital archives communities with preservation base for their rich research materials, and to provide the public with a helpful information retrieval service. Several modifications and extensions for the DSpace system are made in order to integrate various database resources with different formats among university departments. In this paper, we will present our empirical case in which adjustments of the DSpace system are made in areas such as data submission, metadata mapping, digital rights management, user interface and visualization. Our discussion will be focused on the useful applications in which digital archives communities benefit from the adapted DSpace system in disseminating their contents and long-term preservation within NTU campus. We will also discuss the ways in which the users benefit from the new system for searching and using digital archives."

D. Boudia; R. M. G. de Regil,2006,TEF: Metadata for French dissertations,"Since 2000, universities and research institutions have been encouraged to promote and preserve scientific and technical productions by disseminating digital theses and dissertations. This national program implies that new practices and new tools impacting thesis identification are going to be established at different levels (administrative circuit, theses production mode, theses submission methods, document processing chain, dissemination platforms, digital preservation systems...). It is important to describe theses and dissertations using metadata in Internet shared formats to gain information visibility. TEF (Theses Electroniques Francaises) standard objective is to permit quality metadata production, exchange and dissemination for French digital theses and dissertations. TEF defines a metadata set for French digital theses. It proposes two standardization levels: a metadata set and an XML schema (exchange format and validation tool). TEF will be composed of descriptive metadata (bibliographical data) and administrative metadata (administrative circuit, rights and preservation data). The XML schema explicitly defines valid XML documents structure. TEF standard has to facilitate metadata exchange at local level (universities) and at national level (SUDOC, CINES). At local level, it will manage theses production and validation, metadata production and full text access. The descriptive metadata set derives from Dublin Core standard, which guarantees a good interoperability with different kinds of documents or different dissemination environments (cf. OAI-OMH protocol). It is also compatible with NDLTD (Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations) Dublin Core application profile, named ETD-MS (Interoperability Metadata Standard for Electronic Theses and Dissertations)."

D. Rehberger; M. Fegan; M. Kornbluh,2006,"Reevaluating access and preservation through secondary repositories; needs, promises, and challenges","Digital access and preservation questions for cultural heritage institutions have focused primarily on primary repositories - that is, around collections of discrete digital objects and associated metadata. Much of the promise of the information age, however, lies in the ability to reuse, repurpose, combine and build complex digital objects[1-3]. Repositories need both to preserve and make accessible primary digital objects, and facilitate their use in a myriad of ways. Following the lead of other annotation projects, we argue for the development of secondary repositories where users can compose structured collections of complex digital objects. These complex digital objects point back to the primary digital objects from which they are produced (usually with URIs) and augment these pointers with user-generated annotations and metadata. This paper examines how this layered approach to user generated metadata can enable research communities to move forward into more complex questions surrounding digital archiving and preservation, addressing not only the fundamental challenges of preserving individual digital objects long term, but also the access and usability challenges faced by key stakeholders in primary digital repository collections - scholars, educators, and students. Specifically, this project will examine the role that secondary repositories can play in the preservation and access of digital historical and cultural heritage materials with particular emphasis on streaming media. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."

E. Maitland; C. Hall,2006,Cryogenics and creativity: The Frankenstein factor in cultural preservation,"The emergence of new media technologies and their integration into the creative process has led to an explosion of hybrid works whose complexities (both conceptual and material) challenge received ideas about the nature of art and its relationship with the future. 'Variable media' has been coined as a descriptor for creative projects incorporating elements whose viability within future incarnations of the same works may be compromised. The flexible and imaginative approach taken by the innovative new media arts community has much to offer information professionals facing the conservation challenges presented by digital materials. By the same token, the potential application of principles emerging in the field of digital preservation extends well beyond digital resources to encompass works of art and creative enterprises whose material constitution paradoxically threatens them with extinction. The paramount role played by 'process' (as opposed to 'object') has led us to explore various metadata development initiatives, including an extensive online questionnaire developed by the Variable Media Initiative at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and the IFLA Requirements of Bibliographic Standards, with a view to combining elements of each and developing a new model to accommodate the complex documentation of the life cycles of new media artworks and of digital objects. © 2006 Oxford University Press."

Design/methodology/approach - Using a framework that draws on sociological attributes, the main text provides a historical analysis derived from primary and secondary sources, together with a brief overview of current educational provision for the discipline. Findings - The article finds that graduate education in archives and records management has developed in the UK over a period of 60 years (1947-2005) and is well established, with seven Master's-level programmes offered across England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, in a variety of learning modes (full- and part-time, open learning, face-to-face) and from different perspectives and contexts (history, information science, digital preservation). The university research community in the discipline has developed more recently and needs to progress quickly and soundly to support the future intellectual life of the profession. Research limitations/implications - The geographical scope is limited to the UK and focuses in particular on England. Practical implications - The paper identifies some gaps in educational provision, for instance mid-career cross-domain research opportunities, and an apparent lack of interest in academic research by UK practitioners, which might be further investigated. Originality/value - No study of the historical development of the academic discipline of archives and records management has previously been published. © ."
F. Berman,2006,One hundred years of data,"The 20th century brought about an information revolution"" which has forever altered the way we work, communicate, and live. In the 21st century, it is hard to imagine working without an increasingly broad array of enabling technologies and the data they provide. Much of this data will form the foundation for new discovery, advances, and policy over the next 100 years and beyond. The care and management of today's tidal wave of data has become an increasingly important focus for technology development. Collecting, providing, and preserving data responsibly presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Whereas books can be preserved for years and even centuries, the preservation of digital data is dependent on the technologies on which it is stored. In the next 100 years, storage technologies will advance tens of generations, and the digital collections preserved on up - to - date storage technologies will need to transition through each new generation, and many times over. Without a planned approach to preservation, valuable data will be damaged or lost. The stakes are high - some data collections such as the Shoah Collection of Holocaust survivor testimony are irreplaceable, and some data collections such as the longitudinal Panel Study of Income Dynamics used by social scientists, and the Protein Data Bank used by biologists, are fundamental research tools. The challenges of responsible data preservation are great. Key questions that must be addressed in the preservation of long - lived digital data include: 1) What should we save? We can't save everything, and even if we could, it would be exceedingly difficult to find useful information within the mass of data. Some data collections will need to be marked for preservation from the outset, and some collections will need to be ""rescued"". 2) Who is responsible? Digital collections are of interest to many constituents - data generators, users, stewards, etc. Who is responsible for preserving the digital data over the long - term? Who will pay for upkeep, technology transition, and the development of tools and interfaces to make the data accessible? 3) How do we keep data safe? Digital media is more fragile than paper. Software bugs, power outages, hackers, and other problems threaten the reliability of digital collections. The risks can be mitigated when multiple copies of the data collection are generated and updated consistently. 4) How should we save it? Communities vary widely in their usage patterns, formats, standards, and policies with respect to digital data. The cyberinfrastructure in which digital repositories are embedded must provide reliable, safe and usable access. Data collections must be available for analysis, modeling, public access, dissemination, and other types of usage. These questions and many other challenges must be addressed for responsible digital preservation. In this talk we focus on the development and deployment of Cyberinfrastructure for data management and preservation, and the challenges of developing a framework for data management and preservation over the foreseeable future."""

H. Hockx-Yu,2006,Digital preservation in the context of institutional repositories,"Purpose - To discuss the issues and challenges of digital preservation facing institutional repositories and to illustrate the Joint Information Systems Committee's (JISC) view on institutional repositories and its key initiatives in helping UK institutions address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A combination of published work and JISC documents (public facing or internal) were used as reference material. Findings - Digital preservation is a complex process and there are still many unsolved issues which make it a challenging task for institutional repositories. However, the wide deployment of institutional repositories also provides new opportunities for digital preservation. Much could be done to consider digital preservation from the outset, to involve the authors and to embed digital preservation into repository workflow, which will ease the later preservation tasks. Research limitations/implications - A number of ongoing JISC-funded projects are briefly reported which explore different models for the provision of digital preservation services for institutional repositories. These models may be a way forward to tackle collectively the issue of long-term preservation within the setting of institutional repositories. Depending on the outcomes of the projects, further investigation and implementation could be undertaken to test the models. Practical implications - This paper will help the reader to gain a better understanding of the issues related to digital preservation in general and how JISC's work has helped to tackle these issues. Originality/value - This paper clearly states JISC's view on, and future plan for, digital repositories.

Printed information can be accessed directly and easily, provided a physical copy is obtained. It is suggested that the challenge of long term preservation and permanent access can only be met if all parties concerned cooperate in creating solutions such as the permanent R&D effort and the development of business models for cost recovery. It is believed that more official national deposit libraries will build electronic deposits for the long-term preservation of their national scientific publications. The long term preservation functions requires an unremitting research and development commitment and for that new means need to be devised for maintaining accessibility."

J. B. Kopena; J. Shatter; W. C. Regli,2006,CAD archives based on OAIS,"Within the past few years, there has been a steady, substantial growth of interest in long-term"" archiving of digital data. This problem is particularly acute in many branches of engineering design, where cycles of technological obsolescence in supporting tools happen much more rapidly than those of designed products. Capturing and preserving design knowledge through these cycles is a major challenge that has come to be recognized by many government, industry, and research organizations. The ability to do so has important operational, efficiency, and legal ramifications for the manufacturing industry and its customers. This paper describes this problem, presenting examples of both why it must be addressed and why it is a challenge. In particular it relates preservation of engineering data to digital archiving efforts in other domains as well as ongoing work within the engineering research community on design repositories. As is shown, long term archiving of digital design knowledge draws upon both but possesses its own unique issues. Much of this discussion is couched within the language of the ISO Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) Reference Model, including a mapping from an existing significant design repository into the OAIS model. In this way, it is hoped that this paper will widen the discussion on digital archiving within the community of this conference as well as help connect to research in other areas.

J. C. Romero,2006,The role of metadata in digital preservation,"The problem of preserving digital information has now taken on great importance. As the amount of digital information continues to grow, the concern about maintaining access to this information accessible will increase. As elements for describing digital documents or DLO (Document Like Object), metadata play an important role in providing information about the logical aspects of the DLO they refer to, and consequently, in all the tasks related to preservation. At the same time, metadata are digital information, so their preservation must be borne in mind. In this respect, several projects and work groups have been devoted to studying the use of metadata for digital preservation and the preservation of metadata themselves."
J. Currall; P. McKinney; C. Johnson,2006,Digital preservation as an albatross,"'Digital Preservation' as a concept is an albatross. The complex and somewhat arcane nature of the practice has kept it from being embraced by those that perhaps need it most. Changes in terminology, misunderstandings of meanings and a lack of direct business planning have brought about a state of affairs that has the digital preservation community fighting the problem of technological obsolescence without sustained support from organisations that supposedly need it most. Organisations care about ensuring their continued existence and profitability. Investment is only undertaken after reflection on business cases. In creating a business case most people focus primarily on cost, but there must be a counter-veiling focus on value. There is no point in making an investment unless it has worth to the investor. A good business case will display a strong understanding of the value of information objects that organisations create. Information professionals must ensure that their desire to ensure longevity of information is tied coherently and explicitly to that of the organisation's future and detail why the digital materials are of value to it. Exploring value in this way allows engagement with senior management as it wraps the need for action in the terminology of their strategic vision and allows for a strong and successful business case to be made."
J. F. Blanchette,2006,The digital signature dilemma,"The last ten years have seen an enormous amount of legal, regulatory, and technological activity aimed at designing a proper electronic equivalent to handwritten signatures. One such design, that of cryptology-based (or digital) signatures, has succeeded over other solutions to the point where, in certain legal systems, such as those of the Member States of the European Union, electronic signatures are almost exclusively understood to be based on public-key cryptography. Yet, several archival institutions (including the National Archives of Canada, Australia and the US) have expressed ambivalence at the prospect of preserving digitally signed records. This paper argues that discrepancies between technical, legal and archival responses to the problem of long-term preservation of digitally signed documents are founded on diverging understandings - physical vs. contextual - of electronic authenticity."
J. H. Wang; H. C. Chang; C. Y. Lin; L. F. Chien,2006,A peer-to-peer approach to collaborative repository for digital libraries,"Growing amount of precious content digitized in digital libraries (DLs) could cost much digitization, backup, and restoration effort. To meet the requirements in a digital archiving system, several issues must be addressed. First, it usually requires much storage and network bandwidth for each individual DL to maintain its own backup service. Second, the manual effort makes it difficult to maintain. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to collaborative repository for DLs. Cooperating spiders are utilized to facilitate efficient and scalable archiving without much manual effort. The spidering-based approach can automatically keep the structure of content thus enabling simpler implementation and easier support for cross-archive applications.

J. Hunter; S. Choudhury,2006,PANIC: An integrated approach to the preservation of composite digital objects using Semantic Web services,"To date, long-term preservation approaches have comprised of emulation, migration, normalization, and metadata - or some combination of these. Most existing work has focussed on applying these approaches to digital objects of a singular media type: text, HTML, images, video or audio. In this paper, we consider the preservation of composite, mixed-media digital objects, a rapidly growing class of resources. We describe an integrated, flexible system that we have developed, which leverages existing tools and services and assists organizations to dynamically discover the optimum preservation strategy as it is required. The system captures and periodically compares preservation metadata with software and format registries to determine those objects (or sub-objects) at risk. By making preservation software modules available as Web services and describing them semantically using a machine-processable ontology (OWL-S), the most appropriate preservation service(s) for each object (or sub-object) can then be dynamically discovered, composed and invoked by software agents (with optional human input at critical decision-making steps). The PANIC system successfully illustrates how the growing array of available preservation tools and services can be integrated to provide a sustainable, collaborative solution to the long-term preservation of large-scale collections of complex digital objects."

Regarding digital preservation specifically, the 2005 RLG/NARA Audit Checklist for the Certification of a Trusted Digital Repository, Draft for Public Comment (Audit Checklist) is a current document under consideration for determining an institution's ability to be a Trusted Digital Repository. The NDIIPP-sponsored ECHO DEPository project is proposing a framework of evaluation for repository software applications based on the Audit Checklist in conjunction with a common software evaluation scoring methodology.

J. P. McDonough,2006,METS: Standardized encoding for digital library objects,"METS is an XML document format intended for the encoding of complex objects within digital libraries. It provides the means to record all of the descriptive, administrative, structural and behavioral metadata needed to manage and provide access to complex digital content. While it was designed to promote interoperability of digital content between digital library systems and contribute to the preservation of digital library materials, a variety of practical barriers to achieving these goals remain. However, many of these obstacles are shared by other communities of practice, such as the eLearning community working on the IMS content packaging standards and the MPEG-21 community, and the digital library community faces a unique opportunity at the moment to work closely with others to try to improve the interoperability of our content not only with our own repository systems, but those being used by others."

J. Spence,2006,Preserving the cultural heritage: An investigation into the feasibility of the OAIS model for application in small organisations,"Purpose - The purpose of this research is to assess the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model from the perspective of small organisations and to offer a tentative methodology for the provision of a standard framework to serve the movement and preservation of digital materials and associated metadata between organisations, maintaining OAIS compliance throughout. Design/methodology/approach - Structured analysis of the INGEST function, moving through three scenario-based transfers of digital materials, using Lavoie's economic models for digital preservation to demonstrate the relevance of the function and sub-functions. Findings - Provides a conceptual example of how the OAIS model can be used in a multiple transfer context, working through three scenarios for one function of the standard. Describes how the research will be carried forward to complete the analytical framework and test with a real digital deposit. Practical implications - Provides a means by which small organisations can begin to consider the preservation of their digital assets and assess their position in relation to the OAIS model. Originality/value - This paper addresses the difficulties of practical implementation of the OAIS model and suggests a way forward for achieving seamless transfer of digital records that can be used by both small donor organisations and larger receiving institutions. © ."

L. Groarke; G. Warrick,2006,Stewardship gone astray? Ethics and the SAA,"After much deliberation and debate, the Society for American Archaeology (the SAA) has ‘strongly’ endorsed ‘Principles of Archaeological Ethics’. It ‘urges’ archaeologists to use these principles in establishing the responsibilities they have to archaeological resources, to those who have an interest in these resources and to those affected by archaeological work (SAA 2004; SAA Ethics in Archaeology Committee 2000). In this paper, we discuss the implications the SAA principles have for the treatment of archaeological artefacts other than skeletal remains. We have excluded the latter from our discussion for a number of reasons: because skeletal remains raise complex issues that warrant extended discussion on their own; because these issues are investigated in other contributions to this volume; and because we have examined these issues in another context (see Groarke 2001). According to the set of principles the SAA proposes, the basic principle of archaeological ethics is the following principle of stewardship: The archaeological record, that is, in situ archaeological material and sites, archaeological collections, records, and reports, is irreplaceable. It is the responsibility of all archaeologists to work for the long-term conservation and protection of the archaeological record by practicing and promoting stewardship of the archaeological record. Stewards are both caretakers of and advocates for the archaeological record for the benefit of all people; as they investigate and interpret the record, they should use the specialized knowledge they gain to promote public understanding and support for its long-term preservation.

L. Rosenthaler,2006,The (short) history of digital archiving,"Digital long-term archival seems to be an antagonism in itself given that the history of digital computing machinery is only about seventy years old The first concept of a modern digital computer has already been conceived in the 19th century by Charles Babbage. However the construction of the steam driven computer failed because of the limits of precision in the mechanical workmanship of the time. About a hundred years later, his vision started to become reality. With the construction of the first programmable electronic computers, the digital revolution started. As soon as digital computers became general purpose machines, archiving of digital data became a necessity. Archiving of digital data is plagued by (at least) three problems: 1. The medium into which the data is recorded may fail with time 2. The technology (hard- and software) to read and write the medium may become obsolete 3. The information on how to decode the digital code on a medium gets lost In the short history of computing machinery, many attempts have been made to find the best"" storage and archival medium. I will present in this paper experiences of success and failure in the quest of permanent archival of digital data, from the beginning of the history of computing to the visions that loom on the horizons of the future."""

The costs of doing so often determine whether the service is economically viable. We make the case that these applications' demands on large scale storage systems over long time horizons require us to reevaluate traditional system designs. We examine threats to long-lived data from an end-to-end perspective, taking into account not just hardware and software faults but also faults due to humans and organizations. We present a simple model of long-term storage failures that helps us reason about various strategies for addressing some of these threats. Using this model we show that the most important strategies for increasing the reliability of long-term storage are detecting latent faults quickly, automating fault repair to make it cheaper and faster, and increasing the independence of data replicas."

JaJa,2006,"Using scalable and secure web technologies to design a global digital format registry prototype: Architecture, implementation, and testing","One of the most challenging problems confronting the long term preservation of digital information is how to handle format obsolescence. Several methodologies have been suggested in the literature, which include migration, emulation, and standardization to a few common formats. Clearly, a combination of these methodologies will be in use for the foreseeable future. Given this fact, some form of a community-based registry of digital representation formats and their supporting tools will be critical to managing format obsolescence. In this paper, we present the architecture, design, and testing of a Global Digital Format Registry (GDFR) based on scalable, extensible, and secure web technologies. Our architecture will easily be able to incorporate advances achieved through various methodologies and will easily adapt with emerging technologies as it is based on platform independent technologies."

The results of this exploratory study suggest directions for further research and help archivists understand how user needs and preferences may inform selection of preservation methods. Further research on the effectiveness of emulation and migration needs to account for the quality of the emulator, the impact of specific approaches to migration on document attributes and behaviors, and numerous aspects of the original computing environment that may affect the user experience.

In contrast to traditional storage systems in which data lifetimes are measured in months or possibly years, data lifetimes in an archival system are measured in decades. Secure archival storage has the added goal of providing controlled access to its long-term contents. In contrast, public archival systems aim to ensure that their contents are available to anyone.Since secure archival storage systems must store data over much longer periods of time, new threats emerge that affect the security landscape in many novel, subtle ways. These security threats endanger the secrecy, availability and integrity of the archival storage contents. Adequate understanding of these threats is essential to effectively devise new policies and mechanisms to guard against them. We discuss many of these threats in this new context to fill this gap, and show how existing systems meet (or fail to meet) these threats. © 2006 ACM."

This level of resourcing may have been underestimated hitherto in the process of proselytising for institutional repositories. Research limitations/implications This practice-based supposition could be tested more rigorously by proper research investigation. Practical implications Suggests that libraries and librarians are well placed to give input to the metadata and digital preservation activities inherent in building institutional repositories.

Findings That the comprehensive nature of traditional print deposit collection often absolves national libraries from the more intractable problems of stock selection; whereas the difficulty of collecting the entire national digital web space means that intelligent selection is vital for the building of meaningful digital deposit collections. Research limitations/implications These are indicative and partial insights based on small scale interrogation of trial digital deposit collections: the issue of collection development and selection biases in digital collection building needs greater in-depth research before hard and fast recommendations about collection management criteria can be arrived at.

P. Van Garderen,2006,Web 2.0 and access to digital archives,"This is a brief abstract of the 'Web 2.0 and Access to Digital Archives' presentation at the IS&T Archiving 2006 conference. A webcast of the full presentation is available online at: http://archivemati.ca/papers-presentations. Much of the activity in the digital archiving community over the past decade has been focused on critical (and necessary) preservation issues like file formats, preservation metadata and repository architectures. However, the purpose of establishing digital archives is to ensure the ongoing accessibility and usability of the digital information that they preserve. One of the key concept in the Open Archival Information System (OAlS) reference model is that of the 'Designated Community' and the archives' responsibility to make preserved information available and understandable to this community. So how do we make digital information more accessible, usable and understable to designated communities? This presentation reviews the technical and functional architectures of digital archives access systems and speculates whether and how Web 2.0 technologies might be used to improve the quality and effectiveness of these systems. Web 2.0 is mostly a marketing buzz-word that is currently being used to refer to a number of next-generation web trends and technologies. These are clmracterized by open system architectures, integrated web services, rich client interfaces, syndication, personalization, and location-specific services. However, Web 2.0 trends are much more than a new set of tools and technologies. Web 2.0 is most recognizable by a shift towards de-centralized management of information (e.g. folksonomy tagging, Wikipedia, etc.) which includes an explicit trust in the end-user and systems that get better as more people use them. It is these emerging practices that offer the most promise to improving the accessibility of information that is preserved in digital archives."

The San Diego Supercomputer Center has been researching and prototyping preservation cyberinfrastructure for over a decade. In this latest work, we explore a digital archiving framework which focuses on the design, development, automation and reuse of preservation processes (including accessioning, description, arrangement, storage, and preservation) which can be embedded into existing digital production environments. This current work is funded in part by a joint Library of Congress and National Science Foundation program called Digarch, Digital Archiving and Long-Term Preservation. "" We prototype this approach with a collection called ""Conversations with History"" which is produced in a distributed workflow environment (University of California Berkeley with Harry Kreisler and University of California TV with Lynn Burnstan). The collection includes video, audio, images, text, transcripts, web-based material, databases of administrative and descriptive metadata, and contains diverse types of data, created at multiple stages within the content production workflow. Additional partners include the University of California San Diego Libraries. The test collection is 3.5TB in size (7TB when replicated across two different storage devices)."""
R. R. Larson; R. Sanderson,2006,Cheshire3: Retrieving from tera-scale grid-based digital libraries,"Recent research in designing and developing digital library services has been focused on approaches to indexing- and searching in a steadily increasing range of genres and materials. An important aspect of this research is concerned with providing effective and scalable IR services for digital libraries as these diverse collections grow to sizes measured in terabytes and petabytes. The Cheshire project has had a central research focus on large-scale digital library collections for more than a decade, with a current focus on supporting distributed digital libraries in a Grid evironment. At the same time we have have been prototyping systems for very long term digital preservation, and examining how grid-scale information retrieval systems can interoperate with petabytes of diverse data stored over many years. In order for Information Retrieval (IR) in the evolving Grid"" parallel distributed computing environment [1] to work effectively, there must be a single flexible and extensible series of ""Grid Services"" with identifiable objects and a known API to handle the IR functions needed for Digital Libraries or other retrieval tasks. The Cheshire3 system builds on the work of the Cheshire project [4] over the past decade to define and implement an easy to use set of IR objects with precisely defined roles that can effectively provide a Grid Service for IR. This demonstration will show how the Cheshire3 system is being applied in distributed information retrieval tasks in large-scale grid-based digital libraries. We will show how the system has been integrated with ""Datagrid"" services provided by distributed storage systems like the Storage Resource Broker (SRB)[3], and how this enables very large scale storage and retrieval systems with support for data preservation services using the ""Multivalent Document"" framework [2]. In this demo we will present the results of testing Grid-based parallel approaches in indexing and retrieval for a variety of information resources, ranging from small test collections like the TREC and INEX collections, to medium-scale metadata collections like Medline and a test version of University of California Online Union Catalog, MELVYL (with 15 million and 9.5 million records respectively) ranging up to large-scale collections like the US National Records and Archives Administration (NARA) Preservation Prototype. We will describe our approaches to indexing and retrieving from these collections and the architecture of the system that supports them, as well as providing a live demonstrations of Grid-based retrieval over these collections. We will also-show how the system is managed, in both standalone and distributed processing, by a set of user defined workftow descriptions (which are specified simply through XML configuration files). We will demonstrate how Cheshire3 databases are created and how each database is actually a logical collection of records, that can be easily split across many nodes in a Grid environment or combined at a single location. We will show the performance statistics for indexing and retrieval using standard test collections, and examine the performance issues in a distributed environment."""
R. Simha; K. Gopinath,2006,Insurable storage services: Creating a marketplace for long-term document archival,"Digital storages is a key element not only of computing systems, but is now considered an essential component of the infrastructure of any modern organization. This need has co-evolved with the technology that has grown rapidly in recent years to provide low-cost high-capacity storage. At the same time, the storage needs of users have now become more sophisticated and diverse. Sonic users require very long-term preservation; others need high security; and still others ask for highly-reliable, distributed storage solutions. These needs pose a problem for solution providers in that no single solution seems to meet all needs. Similarly, users must construct services out of disk systems on their own. This paper proposes a way to streamline the marketplace through insurable storage services, a combination of two ideas. The first is to define different categories of storage service; the assumption here is that a refined categorization will better identify particular user needs. The second, and more substantive idea, is to treat digital documents as insurable property. The insurance of storage will provide economic incentives for both producers (storage service providers) and consumers (individuals, organizations) to jointly create a marketplace that provides a diversity of differentially-priced services. For example, insurers can help assess the durability of storage solutions and provide, consumers with a quantitative valuation (It'll cost you $x per GB to ensure that your documents last 100 years""), Similarly, storage service providers will have incentives to maintain multiple geographically distributed copies, and to continually move the copies onto emerging technologies (""You'll need to store more copies if you want a higher reliability rating""). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000."""
R. Verdegem; J. Van Der Hoeven,2006,Emulation: To be or not to be,"Emulation is often looked upon with skepticism. Although it may be the only way to render complex digital objects in the future without affecting their authenticity and integrity, emulation is considered to be too technically challenging and therefore too expensive and time consuming. This line of thought has thus far prevented emulation from being developed for digital preservation purposes. The Nationaal Archief of the Netherlands and the National Library of the Netherlands (KB) believe that a preservation approach based on emulation is worthwhile and that it needs further development and testing in order to establish its true value. This paper presents an overview of emulation as a preservation approach, a conceptual model of modular emulation, experiment results and goals of the emulation project."

The certificate can also be used as an instrument to support open access. Findings - Repository certification will not be the main factor in achieving open access to academic information globally, but it can support the spread of institutional repositories and enhance visibility of the ""institutional repository""-service. Research limitations/implications - The DINI Certificate as a ""soft"" certificate aims towards interoperability of digital repositories, the coaching idea prevails. It does not provide an exhaustive auditing tool for trusted digital long-term preservation archives. Practical implications - The ""DINI certificate for document and publication repositories"" pushed the development of institutional repositories in Germany according to certain organisational and technical standards and contributes to the interoperability amongst digital repositories worldwide.

Support has been provided by the Digital Archiving and Preservation program funded by NSF/CISE and the Library of Congress. In addition to the more than 92,000 objects stored in the SIOExplorer Digital Library, the testbed provides access to data, photographs, video images and documents from WHOI ships, Alvin submersible and Jason ROV dives, and deep-towed vehicle surveys. An interactive digital library interface allows combinations of distributed collections to be browsed, metadata inspected, and objects displayed or selected for download. The digital library architecture, and the search and display tools of the SIOExplorer project, are being combined with WHOI tools, such as the Alvin Framegrabber and the Jason Virtual Control Van, that have been designed using WHOI's GeoBrowser to handle the vast volumes of digital video and camera data generated by Alvin, Jason and other deep submergence vehicles. Notions of scalability will be tested, as data volumes range from 3 CDs per cruise to 200 DVDs per cruise. Much of the scalability of this proposal comes from an ability to attach digital library data and metadata acquisition processes to diverse sensor systems. We are able to run an entire digital library from a laptop computer as well as from supercomputer-center-size resources. It can be used, in the field, laboratory or classroom, covering data from acquisition-to-archive using a single coherent methodology. The design is an open architecture, supporting applications through well-defined external interfaces maintained as an open-source effort for community inclusion and enhancement."

Morris,2006,Geospatial web services and geoarchiving: New opportunities and challenges in geographic information services,"Over the course of the past fifteen years the role of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has changed significantly. Initially the role of the map library was confined to that of building and providing access to collections of hard copy maps and imagery. Later, digital data, whether on CD-ROMs or network based, was added as a new type of resource within that collection and service model. By the late 1990s some academic libraries began to take on a Web map server role, providing interactive Web mapping access to collections of digital geospatial data. In the new era of distributed, interoperable map services, libraries will have an opportunity to explore new roles as portals to streaming content available in the form of geospatial Web services.

The purpose of the spaceflight experiments data archive is to establish an entire information system, which is capable to store flight and ground data for long times according to the ESAs Data Policy for Space Flights and to provide an user friendly access to all experiment related mission data. HyperTest® uses meta data to organize the storage in meaningful logical relationships. The meta information about experiments are searchable and lead to the data. In addition, a full text search is implemented. Searching through documents leads to information and data linked to it. In summary, a combination of navigating in logical structures and searching quickly leads to the data. The HyperTest® data archive was currently used to archive the data of the parabolic flight campaign of the Electromagnetic levitation (EML) pay load in May 2006. After each flight day the data were injected into the HyperTest® data storage. After the injection process the meta data were attached to the data and the mission information was directly accessible via HyperTest®. Thus the system could be used already during or shortly after the campaign for the participating experimenters to get access to the scientific data."

T. Reichherzer; G. Brown,2006,Quantifying software requirements for supporting archived office documents using emulation,"This paper addresses the issues associated with building software images to support a collection of archived documents using machine emulators. Emulation has been proposed as a strategy for preservation of digital documents that require their original software for access. The creation of software images is a critical component in archiving documents via emulation. The software images include the operating system, application software, and supporting software artifacts such as fonts and Codecs (Compression-Decompression algorithm). A practical emulation environment to support a digital document requires both an emulator and a software image. This paper considers the issues associated with creating such software images to support Microsoft Office documents. In particular, we discuss a set of software tools and strategies that we developed to automatically analyze the dependencies of Microsoft Office documents on software resources and supporting files. As a proof of concept, the tools and strategies have been applied to establish dependencies of Office documents from a document library containing approximately 200,000 documents and to automatically collect missing resources such as fonts. The software tools are a first step toward an interactive system that aids in the construction of robust emulation environments for preserving digital artifacts. However, they may also be used in other contexts, for example, to support screening of documents for archiving and migration to new platforms to ensure correct visualization. Copyright 2006 ACM."

Besides, folklore and religious rituals embed spiritual meanings. Step-by-step procedure of a ritual is not trivial for a people or a religion. The motivation of this project are manifested in three aspects: (1) folklore crafts, skills, and rituals play the same important roles in preserving our ancestor's wisdom in addition to folklore artifacts; (2) media richness facilitates learning of courses with high uncertainty and equivocality; and (3) e-learning with interactive videos gains more learner satisfaction than non-interactive and traditional classroom learning according to recent studies.

Y. Iwakiri; T. Kaneko,2006,High-precision texture mapping on 3D free-form objects,"Cultural heritage objects such as historical buildings and sculptures are being lost every year due to such causes as earthquakes and fires, so that the need of preserving such objects digitally is becoming widely recognized. Digital preservation is carried out by measuring both 3D shape and optical property of an object of interest. The shape is usually measured with a laser scanner while the optical property is measured with a digital camera. It has been found to be difficult to match textures on the object surface exactly. Matching is carried out usually via camera parameters associated with the digital camera employed. Such camera parameters are usually derived based upon object silhouettes or perimeters. This paper proposes utilization of both silhouettes and textures for a more precise match of textures on the object surface. Furthermore, it proposes an algorithm to derive an optimal set of camera positions to realize a constant overlapping ratio. The proposed methods were applied to two examples, resulting in excellent matching. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) has undertaken research to automate the extraction of metadata from documents in PDF([22]). Documents may include scientific journal papers, lab notes or even emails. We suggest genre classification as a first step toward automating metadata extraction. The classification method will be built on looking at the documents from five directions; as an object of specific visual format, a layout of strings with characteristic grammar, an object with stylo-metric signatures, an object with meaning and purpose, and an object linked to previously classified objects and external sources.

This paper describes and evaluates a configurable archive construction system, which integrates document image pre-processing and analysis with text post-processing tools and a standard OCR package to meet digital archiving requirements. The prototype system is currently being used in conjunction with the UK Natural History Museum to help convert more than 500,000 cards of Lepidoptera (Butterflies and Moths) and Coleoptera (Beetles) to searchable digital archives. Evaluation results covering different aspects of the system from card scanning to overall word recognition rates for different database fields are summarised for two datasets comprising over 5,000 cards selected from different parts of these archives. First-pass end-to-end word recognition rates of 70-90% are reported for key data fields, subject to availability of suitable electronic dictionaries. Further validation and correction is supported through web-editing of the online digital archive. © Springer-Verlag 2006."

A. Japzon; D. E. Agosto,2007,Exploration of the motivation for and knowledge of preservation practices for personal digital artifacts,"Libraries and other cultural institutions are very aware of the crisis in digital preservation and are taking steps to preserve our collective cultural heritage. In contrast, most individual consumers are much less aware of the impermanent state of their digital possessions. As a result, valuable representations of personal memories intended for future generations will be lost through ignorance and/or benign neglect. This research will explore user behavior as it relates to the preservation of personal digital objects. We seek to understand: value and digital objects, what steps individuals are taking towards preservation, and how preservation decisions are informed. The theory of information source horizons will be used to examine the criteria for value and the relationship between the continuum of physical and digital artifacts. Qualitative research methods will be used to explore the behaviors, attitudes and beliefs of individuals regarding digital preservation. In the first phase of this research, 12 semi-structured interviews will be conducted with Friends Groups' members of a large urban public library. Analysis of the interview transcripts will lead to insights into the affective and cognitive issues surrounding personal digital artifacts in their own right and in comparison to personal physical artifacts. Further, the analysis will provide insight regarding the contexts in which individuals value information and how that sense of value impacts both the organization of and preservation of personal information."

DigIn is a graduate college-approved study program consisting of six newly developed graduate-level courses to be delivered online. The certificate serves as an entry point for students who are considering pursuing master's degrees in archives or library science and who also have an interest in technology and digital curation. For those already holding or concurrently pursuing a master's or doctoral degree in library and information science, it serves as a post-master's certificate of specialty or an area of concentration. Finally, the certificate offers current practitioners a practical way to update and enhance their skills for existing employment or in contemplation of new opportunities. Curriculum development is grounded in a functional approach designed to integrate the practices of librarians, archivists, records managers and technologists within a framework of disciplinary knowledge and the work of interrelated communities of practice. The coursework balances subject knowledge and practical hands-on skills relevant to digital curation and insures that students acquire an understanding of the professions while demonstrating comfort and proficiency with technology and the ability to continue to develop their technical skills upon completion of the program."

OAR uses precision metrology and digital image processing to obtain and convert groove contour data into digital audio for access and preservation. This contactless and imaging-based approach has considerable advantages over the traditional mechanical methods, such as being the only optical method with the potential to restore broken stereo records. Although past efforts on monophonic phonograph records have been successful, no attempts on 33rpm long-playing stereo records (LPs) have been reported.

C. Dallas,2007,An agency-oriented approach to digital curation theory and practice,"Digital curation emerged as an important new concept in the theory and management of cultural information, not least because of its broad applicability and promise of a universal approach to ensure future fitness for purpose"" of digital information. This paper explores curatorial traditions in the field of museums and cultural heritage, in order to contribute to the active current debate on the nature, scope and methods of digital curation. It uses an approach inspired by cultural-historical activity theory in order, first, to understand current digital curation practice, its achievements and limitations; secondly, to explore key activities in the cultural heritage field, i.e., knowledge production in archaeological fieldwork and publication, museum curation, and meaning interaction in exhibition visitor experience. On account of these insights, it concludes that, in order to ensure the declared objective of future ""fitness for purpose"", and avoid the risk of epistemic failure, more effort should be dedicated by the digital curation community to developing adequate knowledge representation of digital information in specific epistemic and pragmatic contexts; that an agency-based approach, using event-centric approaches to represent knowledge on the content and context of information, would be particularly useful in some application domains; and that formal methods to curation lifecycle based on belief change and ontology evolution could also be used in modeling the co-evolution of the epistemic content and context of curated knowledge."""
C. Normand; R. Gschwind; P. Fornaro,2007,"Digital images for eternity"": Color microfilm as archival medium""","In the archiving and museum communities, the long-term preservation of artworks has traditionally been guaranteed by making duplicates of the original. For photographic reproductions, digital imaging devices have now become standard, providing better quality control and lower costs than film photography. However, due to the very short life cycle of digital data, losses are unavoidable without repetitive data migrations to new file formats and storage media. We present a solution for the long-term archiving of digital images on color microfilm (Ilfochrome® Micrographic). This extremely stable and high-resolution medium, combined with the use of a novel laser film recorder is particularly well suited for this task. Due to intrinsic limitations of the film, colorimetric reproductions of the originals are not always achievable. The microfilm must be first considered as an information carrier and not primarily as an imaging medium. Color transformations taking into account the film characteristics and possible degradations of the medium due to aging are investigated. An approach making use of readily available color management tools is presented which assures the recovery of the original colors after re-digitization. An extension of this project considering the direct recording of digital information as color bit-code on the film is also introduced. © 2007 SPIE-IS&T."

Archiving the vast amounts of digital data that we are producing for future generations is becoming a huge challenge. Physical preservation for centuries using media types that have only been in existence for decades is only one part of the problem. Making sure that future generations can read the information is another; it's unlikely that someone in 2050 will be using today's Microsoft Office formats, for example, or even have a computer that could run the software.

D. Lee,2007,Practical maintenance of evolving metadata for digital preservation: Algorithmic solution and system support,"Metadata (i.e., data describing about data) of digital objects plays an important role in digital libraries and archives, and thus its quality needs to be maintained well. However, as digital objects evolve over time, their associated metadata evolves as well, causing a consistency issue. Since various functionalities of applications containing digital objects (e.g., digital library, public image repository) are based on metadata, evolving metadata directly affects the quality of such applications. To make matters worse, modern data applications are often large-scale (having millions of digital objects) and are constructed by software agents or crawlers (thus often having automatically populated and erroneous metadata). In such an environment, it is challenging to quickly and accurately identify evolving metadata and fix them (if needed) while applications keep running. Despite the importance and implications of the problem, the conventional solutions have been very limited. Most of existing metadata-related approaches either focus on the model and semantics of metadata, or simply keep authority file of some sort for evolving metadata, and never fully exploit its potential usage from the system point of view. On the other hand, the question that we raise in this paper is when millions of digital objects and their metadata are given, (1) how to quickly identify evolving metadata in various context? and (2) once the evolving metadata are identified, how to incorporate them into the system?"" The significance of this paper is that we investigate scalable algorithmic solution toward the identification of evolving metadata and emphasize the role of ""systems"" for maintenance, and argue that ""systems"" must keep track of metadata changes pro-actively, and leverage on the learned knowledge in their various services. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."""
D. Lekkas; D. Gritzalis,2007,Long-term verifiability of the electronic healthcare records' authenticity,"Purpose: To investigate whether the long-term preservation of the authenticity of electronic healthcare records (EHR) is possible. To propose a mechanism that enables the secure validation of an EHR for long periods, far beyond the lifespan of a digital signature and at least as long as the lifetime of a patient.Approach: The study is based on the fact that although the attributes of data authenticity, i.e. integrity and origin verifiability, can be preserved by digital signatures, the necessary period for the retention of EHRs is far beyond the lifespan of a simple digital signature. it is identified that the lifespan of signed data is restricted by the validity period of the relevant keys and the digital certificates, by the future unavailability of signature-verification data, and by suppression of trust relationships. In this paper, the notarization paradigm is exploited, and a mechanism for cumulative notarization of signed EHR is proposed.Results: The proposed mechanism implements a successive trust transition towards new entities, modern technologies, and refreshed data, eliminating any dependency of the relying party on ceased entities, obsolete data, or weak old technologies. The mechanism also exhibits strength against various threat scenarios.Conclusions: A future relying party will have to trust only the fresh technology and information provided by the last notary, in order to verify the authenticity of an old signed EHR. A Cumulatively Notarized Signature is strong even in the case of the compromise of a notary in the chain. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

E. Meyer; P. Grussenmeyer; J. P. Perrin; A. Durand; P. Drap,2007,A web information system for the management and the dissemination of Cultural Heritage data,"Safeguarding and exploiting Cultural Heritage induce the production of numerous and heterogeneous data. The management of these data is an essential task for the use and the diffusion of the information gathered on the field. Previously, the data handling was a hand-made task done thanks to efficient and experienced methods. Until the growth of computer science, other methods have been carried out for the digital preservation and treatment of Cultural Heritage information. The development of computerized data management systems to store and make use of archaeological datasets is then a significant task nowadays. Especially for sites that have been excavated and worked without computerized means, it is now necessary to put all the data produced onto computer. This allows preservation of the information digitally (in addition with the paper documents) and offers new exploitation possibilities, like the immediate connection of different kinds of data for analyses, or the digital documentation of the site for its improvement. Geographical Information Systems have proved their potentialities in this scope, but they are not always adapted to the management of features at the scale of a particular archaeological site. Therefore this paper aims to present the development of a Virtual Research Environment dedicated to the exploitation of intra-site Cultural Heritage data. The Information System produced is based on open-source software modules dedicated to the Internet, so users can avoid being software driven and can register and consult data from different computers. The system gives the opportunity to do exploratory analyses of the data, especially at spatial and temporal levels. The system is compliant to every kind of Cultural Heritage site and allows management of diverse types of data.

This standard seeks to guarantee the long-term visual appearance of an electronic document. For collections to be archived as PDF files, it makes sense to select the PDF/A file format, because this particular type of PDF file makes it easier to migrate to future file formats. However, in the years before the PDF/A specification became a standard, many organizations began creating archives of collections in PDF, but in formats not necessarily compatible with PDF/A. Because of its value to preservation that PDF/A offers, there is an advantage to migrating collections to PDF/A. Commercial software tools are becoming available, both for creating PDF/A files and for evaluating their compatibility with the PDF/A standard. One such tool was used to study PDF files culled from the Internet as well as from an in-house collection to determine the chances of success for migrating an archived collection of PDF documents to PDF/A. This study explores the types of problems posed by such a migration, and determines the circumstances in which a migration would be successful."

The reconstructions were performed using our web-repository crawler named Warrick which recovers missing resources from the Web Infrastructure (WI), the collective preservation effort of web archives and search engine caches. We examine several characteristics of the websites over time including birth rate, decay and age of resources. We evaluate the reconstructions when compared to the crawled sites and develop a statistical model for predicting reconstruction success from the WI.

The study was conducted in the interest of implementing best practices in information life-cycle management, to dispel any misunderstandings related to digital formats, and to provide scientific and technical information agencies with enough information so they can determine the most appropriate preservation format for their environment. Four formats commonly used or being considered for use by CENDI agencies and other organizations for preserving documents, TIFF, PDF, PDFA, and XML, were reviewed. A previous assessment of these formats, which was conducted by the Library of Congress (LC) as part of a more comprehensive evaluation of LC collections, is put in the context of the CENDI agencies.

Without action, much of what has been created in digital form is likely to become unusable. Although a decade has already elapsed since this challenge was clearly articulated, nobody has described a complete procedure for preventing such loss - until now. Leading industry consultant Henry M. Gladney outlines a technical solution and justifies its correctness and optimality. His presentation focuses on long-term digital preservation principles as a basis for producing the software that will be needed. The method described will work for any kind of digital document, multimedia file, business record collection, or scientific information, and is believed to be optimal with respect to both the quality of the preserved information and end-user convenience.

However, when preservation and widespread access are most critical, some curators are considering how best to build digital library systems without databases. In many instances, XML-based formats are recommended because of many known advantages. This paper discusses the Bleek and Lloyd Collection, where such a solution was adopted. The Bleek and Lloyd Collection is a set of books and drawings that document the language and culture of some Bushman groups in Southern Africa, arguably one of the oldest yet most vulnerable and fragile cultures in the world. Databases were avoided because of the need for multi-OS support, longterm preservation and the use of large collections in remote locations with limited Internet access.

I. Barnes,2007,The digital scholar's workbench,"In this paper I present the reasoning behind the development of a new end-to-end publishing system for academic writers. The story starts with investigating digital preservation of word processing documents. What file formats are suitable for long-term preservation of text? I believe that the answer is a high-quality structured XML format like DocBook XML or TEI. The next question is how do we get word processing documents into that format without incurring a prohibitive cost? Conversion is possible, but it requires human intervention at some point. It would be far too expensive to have archivists editing every document by hand on ingest, so how can we get authors to do the necessary work, particularly as most academics aren't at all interested in digital preservation of their work? The answer I propose is to offer them more than just an archiving solution. Instead of just getting preservation, they get a full end-to-end digital publishing solution, the digital scholar's workbench, tailored to their needs for document interoperability, collaboration and publication in multiple formats oh, and they get preservation too."
J. A. Smith; M. L. Nelson,2007,Generating best-effort preservation metadata for Web resources at time of dissemination,"HTTP and MIME, while sufficient for contemporary webpage access, do not provide enough forensic information to enable the long-term preservation of the resources they describe and transport. But what if the originating web server automatically provided preservation metadata encapsulated with the resource at time of dissemination? Perhaps the ingestion process could be streamlined, with additional forensic metadata available to future information archeologists. We have adapted an Apache web server implementation of OAI-PMH which can utilize third-party metadata analysis tools to provide a metadata-rich description of each resource. The resource and its forensic metadata are packaged together as a complex object, expressed in plain ASCII and XML. The result is a CRATE: a self-contained preservation-ready version of the resource, created at time of dissemination. Copyright 2007 ACM."
J. C. Fernández-Molina; J. A. C. Guimarães,2007,Las nuevas leyes de derecho de autor: ¿Adecuadas para la preservación digital?,"Introduction. Besides technical and economic-organisational problems, digital preservation also faces legal issues, especially regarding copyright legislation, since all digital preservation strategies involve copying materials and/or using software which is typically copyrighted. The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the extent to which current copyright laws meet the preservation requirements of library materials.. Methodology. A cross-sectional analysis of recently updated national copyright laws as well as the impact of the other two protection methods: contractual and technological. Results. Even after the latest updates current copyright legislation is almost useless for digital preservation activities since the opportunities provided by WIPO Copyright Treaty to adapt and extend copyright exceptions and limitations have been used to the full. Conclusion. We need a legislation reform that will make it possible to carry out all required copying and communication activities and software use, even if circumventing technological protection is needed. But that is not enough for licensed works. The best solution for this kind of work is to include specific clauses in the licences that facilitate preservation activities. Thus, cooperation between both parties, libraries and rights' holders, is essential. © the authors, 2007."
J. C. Ramalho; M. Ferreira; L. Faria; R. Castro,2007,Relational database preservation through XML modelling,"Digital Archives are complex structures composed of human resources, state of the art technologies, policies and data. Due to the heritage keeping role that archives assume in our society, it is important to make sure that, the data that is produced by our organizations is preserved accordingly in order do document is activity and provide evidence of their activities. Information stored in an archive must be treated differently than other types of information because it is kept with the purpose of providing evidence of some organizations activity. Due to this fact some properties should be preserved for long periods of time: integrity, liability and authenticity. The preservation of this information extremely complex as digital objects are far from being stable. They are software and hardware dependent. Normally, their auto-preservation period is about 5 years. In this context digital preservation practices become very important and should be part of the institution's planning. The problem is how to keep digital objects in such a way that their information is accessible long past their auto-preservation period. RODA (Repository of Authentic Digital Objects) is a joint venture between public administration and academic researchers that aims to become the public administration repository. A repository where users can rely on digital objects authenticity and where digital objects are expected to endure long beyond the 5 years expectation. For the first prototype three kinds of digital objects were considered: text documents, still images and relational databases. We will focus this paper on the relational databases component. Relational databases ingestion is accomplished by migrating the original database to an XML representation. This representation (DBML - database markup language) was defined according to a series of requisites, trying to preserve database content, database structure and database attributes. Throughout the paper we will discuss the creation of DBML and report its application to some real case studies. Copyright © 2007 José Carlos Ramalho, Miguel Ferreira, Luís Faria, and Rui Castro."

Hunter,2007,AONS - An obsolescence detection and notification service for Web archives and digital repositories,"This paper describes the results of a collaboration between the University of Queensland, the Australian National University and the National Library of Australia which has developed and deployed an automatic obsolescence detection and notification service (AONS) for digital collections. AONS can be configured to run over different types of collections of digital objects - either institutional repositories (DSpace or Fedora) or Web archives such as the National Library's PANDORA ('Preserving and Accessing Networked DOcumentary Resources of Australia') Archive. This work represents a real-world implementation of the obsolescence detection and notification service originally developed within the University of Queensland's PANIC Project. PANIC (Preservation and Archival of New media and Interactive Collections) was a prototype system based on a semantic Web services architecture which was designed to semi-automate the preservation of digital collections. This paper describes how AONS can be configured to automatically monitor collections for format obsolescence and streamline the subsequent migration of 'at risk' digital objects to current recommended formats, enabling their long-term preservation and accessibility."

J. Doyle; H. L. Viktor; E. Paquet,2007,Long term digital preservation - An end user's perspective,"The issue of long term preservation of digital data has, in recent years, become a critical issue with many diverse groups and organisations recognising the need to preserve digital documents before they fall victim to digital obsolescence. However, there is a distinct lack of discussion regarding the needs of future end users of such preserved documents. This is surprising, given that it is the end user who ultimately determines what information should be archived and in what way. Furthermore, it is essential that a preserved document retains its authenticity and usability through time and is easily interpreted by future end users. To this extent, we present in this paper details of our case study: an emulation framework to preserve 2D and 3D anthropometric data. We describe the testing of this emulation environment, by anthropometric experts, against the original environment and compare the two based on a given set of usability and authenticity criteria. ©2007 IEEE."
J. Liu; D. Yang,2007,Status of the preservation of digital resources in China: Results of a survey,"Purpose - To obtain first-hand data on the main challenges in preserving digital resources in libraries, archives and information centres in China. Design/methodology/approach - The data in this paper have been acquired by e-mail questionnaire. The conclusions are based on feedback from 57 respondents, distributed in 14 provinces in China, who work in libraries, archives and information centres with rich digital collections and long-term experience in preserving digital resources. Findings - The authors consider that the long-term preservation of digital resources in China faces two critical difficulties: firstly, the pressure on preserving digital resources has not been fully recognised and so the relevant training in the management and operation of digital preservation is absent; secondly, government departments attach little importance to this field and lack uniform guidelines. Therefore, the paper suggests that relevant international conferences or workshops should be held in China, and that a working group led by the National Development and Reform Commission of China should be set up to plan the construction, sharing and maintenance of Chinese digital resources. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited to Chinese administration systems. Although the data in this paper are authentic and representative, nevertheless it is a small sample of the numerous document collection organisations in the country. Practical implications - The data and analysis in this paper should greatly help international colleagues understand the status regarding the preservation of digital resources in China. Originality/value - This research is the first of its kind undertaken in China and will provide a new vision for international peers and organisations involved in digital documentary heritage around the world. © ."
J. Redman; M. Mudge,2007,The simultaneous capture of spectral and textural information,"Digital archiving of cultural heritage has heretofore focused on capturing accurate color information via spectral imaging. We review a means of capturing topographical information entitled reflection transformation imaging. This paper discusses an experiment that attempts to merge these two techniques. Several paintings were imaged and color accurate, interactive texture maps were generated. Experimental deficiencies are identified and suggestions are made for remediation. A new dual-imaging technique with improved capability is discussed. Our conclusion is that the simultaneous capture of high-accuracy spectral and textural information is entirely feasible."

J. Steffen; E. Huyck,2007,Change in the publishing sector,"Journals publishing has come a long way since the University of Chicago Press began delivering electronic content in 1995. It has not changed in some fundamental respects: the journal itself remains the primary vehicle of research; there remains a need and a demand for high-quality editing to optimize the communication of that research; and journals publishing done well still has significant but recoverable costs associated with it. There have also been many changes, with more always appearing on the horizon. Some we have been thinking about in some fashion for the last 10 years, including the ever-expanding reach of the journal as construct; wider geographical scope; the prospect of discontinuing printed journals; the increased use and potential of linking and other features realizable only online; and greater attention to the various challenges of long-term preservation of an expanding variety of content in nontraditional formats. We continue to find this an exhilarating evolution of a steadfast scholarly goal."

K. Hänström,2007,Autenticitet i en digital värld Långsiktsbevarande av almänna handlingar,"Long term preservation of electronic records has been an object of debate in the archival community for many years. The increasing use of digital technology by governmental agencies means that current public records often have exclusively electronic form. Long term preservation of electronic records implies new problems, for instance because the information content and the media carrying the information can be separated. Thus traditional means of securing the preservation of records, primarily focusing on physical arrangement and physical custody, have become insufficient. This has practical implications for the handling of records, and has also generated new theoretical models in the archival domain. This study focuses on the problem of authenticity concerning long term preservation of electronic official documents. The aim is to find out whether authenticity problems can occur when governmental agencies create and later transfer electronic records to the National Archives for long term preservation. The study consists of three parts: a literature review aiming at identifying and analysing central theoretical concepts; an analysis of Swedish legislation to identify the legal requirements on electronic official documents relevant according to the concept of authenticity; and finally, testing these legal requirements against the LnterPares project's analytical model for authentic electronic records. The findings show that there are scarce possibilities to establish and maintain long term authenticity within the current legal framework. The study also shows that international theoretical concepts to a large extent are applicable on Swedish conditions, which enables the use of general theoretical models and international standards. However, some differences in the interpretation of the concept of records and records' evidential value can be recognized."

These are relatively large objects existing outdoors and providing various technical challenges. Geometric models of the great Buddhas are digitally achieved through a pipeline, consisting of acquiring data, aligning multiple range images, and merging these images. We have developed two alignment algorithms: a rapid simultaneous algorithm, based on graphics hardware, for quick data checking on site, and a parallel alignment algorithm, based on a PC cluster, for precise adjustment at the university. We have also designed a parallel voxel-based merging algorithm for connecting all aligned range images. On the geometric models created, we aligned texture images acquired from color cameras. We also developed two texture mapping methods. In an attempt to restore the original appearance of historical objects, we have synthesized several buildings and statues using scanned data and a literature survey with advice from experts. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

From the perspective of recreating a performance and/or later analysis, these technologies and media have added much complexity to preservation issues. Preserving an interactive multimedia performance involves keeping human interactions with multimedia systems, the multimedia contents generated (usually music and graphical animation) and the artistic, cultural and technical knowledge embedded in the performance material so that a recreation of the performance is possible in the future. This paper introduces an approach to such a challenging preservation by using 3D motion data for coding human interactions and ontologies for knowledge preservation together with the preservation framework developed in the CASPAR EC IST project, which is based on the standardised Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model.

Klein,2007,Using the web infrastructure to preserve web pages,"To date, most of the focus regarding digital preservation has been on replicating copies of the resources to be preserved from the living web"" and placing them in an archive for controlled curation. Once inside an archive, the resources are subject to careful processes of refreshing (making additional copies to new media) and migrating (conversion to new formats and applications). For small numbers of resources of known value, this is a practical and worthwhile approach to digital preservation. However, due to the infrastructure costs (storage, networks, machines) and more importantly the human management costs, this approach is unsuitable for web scale preservation. The result is that difficult decisions need to be made as to what is saved and what is not saved. We provide an overview of our ongoing research projects that focus on using the ""web infrastructure"" to provide preservation capabilities for web pages and examine the overlap these approaches have with the field of information retrieval. The common characteristic of the projects is they creatively employ the web infrastructure to provide shallow but broad preservation capability for all web pages. These approaches are not intended to replace conventional archiving approaches, but rather they focus on providing at least some form of archival capability for the mass of web pages that may prove to have value in the future. We characterize the preservation approaches by the level of effort required by the web administrator: web sites are reconstructed from the caches of search engines (""lazy preservation""); lexical signatures are used to find the same or similar pages elsewhere on the web (""just-in-time preservation""); resources are pushed to other sites using NNTP newsgroups and SMTP email attachments (""shared infrastructure preservation""); and an Apache module is used to provide OAI-PMH access to MPEG-21 DIDL representations of web pages (""web server enhanced preservation""). © 2007 Springer-Verlag."""

In many cases the databases are still carrying valuable information. The regulations and recommendations by the archivists often advise to store information as sequential files. In those formats the data is safe but in most cases very hard to use when the original applications are no longer available.

The DPAM programme ran from 2004 until 2006 and aimed to establish a basis for the development of institutional strategies and policies for long-term preservation and asset management. Eleven projects were funded by the project across three main themes: Institutional management support and collaboration; Digital asset assessment tools (DAATs); and institutional repository infrastructure development. The study found that the programme was a resounding success. Projects delivered a number of highly relevant and reusable outputs such as demonstrative shared services, survey and assessment tools, costing formulae, case studies,and a number of different training courses. Issues addressed by projects ranged from metadata, repository software and repository frameworks to business planning, life-cycle planning, legal issues and strategy development.In summarising the DPAM synthesis study, this article provides an overview of each of the funded projects and explores project outputs with regards to a selected number of recurring themes. Further themes are explored in thesynthesis study itself and readers are encouraged to refer to the study for more information."
M. Smorul; M. McGann; J. Jaja,2007,PAWN: A policy-driven software environment for implementing producer-archive interactions in support of long term digital preservation,"The ingestion process of digital objects into a long term archive constitutes a critical phase of the overall archiving process during which the object's content, metadata, context, and provenance have to be assembled correctly. This task becomes quite complicated when there are many independent producers involved, each with a possibly different arrangement with the archive. In this paper, we describe the underpinnings of a novel software environment for capturing the interactions between distributed producers and an archive which ensures the inclusion of all the necessary elements to preserve the digital information. A prototype system called PAWN (Producer - Archive Workflow Network) provides a flexible and scalable platform for creating and securely ingesting digital information into a remote archive while allowing flexible interactions between the producer and the archive. PAWN is policy - driven with built-in core functions and policies that can be customized to address ingestion requirements for any archiving community. The environment is platform - independent and is based on open standards and web technologies, and is designed to operate across multiple administrative domains using strong security mechanisms. The latest PAWN release version .5 is currently under testing by a number of projects that involve realistic environments with significant amounts of digital data to be preserved."
M. Vardigan; C. Whiteman,2007,ICPSR meets OAIS: Applying the OAIS reference model to the social science archive context,"This paper reviews the archival process at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), a repository of digital social science data, and maps ICPSR's Ingest and Access operations to the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model. The paper also assesses ICPSR's conformance with the archival responsibilities of trusted"" OAIS repositories, with the proviso that audit criteria for archival certification are still under development. The ICPSR to OAIS mapping exercise has benefits for the larger social science archiving community because it provides an interpretation of the reference model in the quantitative social science environment and points to preservation-related issues that may be salient for other social science archives. Building on the archives' long tradition of shared norms and cooperation, we may ultimately be able to design a federated system of trusted social science repositories that provides access to the global heritage. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."""
N. Ikonomov; M. Dobreva,2007,CREATION OF A DIGITAL CORPUS OF BULGARIAN DIALECTS,"The paper presents our considerations related to the creation of a digital corpus of Bulgarian dialects. The dialectological archive of Bulgarian language consists of more than 250 audio tapes. All tapes were recorded between 1955 and 1965 in the course of regular dialectological expeditions throughout the country. The records typically contain interviews with inhabitants of small villages in Bulgaria. The topics covered are usually related to such issues as birth, everyday life, marriage, family relationship, death, etc. Only a few tapes contain folk songs from different regions of the country. Taking into account the progressive deterioration of the magnetic media and the realistic prospects of data loss, the Institute for Bulgarian Language at the Academy of Sciences launched in 1997 a project aiming at restoration and digital preservation of the dialectological archive. Within the framework of this project more than the half of the records was digitized, de-noised and stored on digital recording media. Since then restoration and digitization activities are done in the Institute on a regular basis. As a result a large collection of sound files has been gathered. Our further efforts are aimed at the creation of a digital corpus of Bulgarian dialects, which will be made available for phonological and linguistic research. Such corpora typically include besides the sound files two basic elements: a transcription, aligned with the sound file, and a set of standardized metadata that defines the corpus. In our work we will present considerations on how these tasks could be realized in the case of the corpus of Bulgarian dialects. Our suggestions will be based on a comparative analysis of existing methods and techniques to build such corpora, and by selecting the ones that fit closer to the particular needs. Our experience can be used in similar institutions storing folklore archives, history related spoken records etc. © 2007 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings."

A historical architecture, the main hall of the Pao-An Temple, was preserved in a digital format with the architectural shapes retrieved more accurate than traditional manual measurements did. The difficulties in measuring as-built free forms and curves up to the size of a building were encountered and solved to enable the display of the hidden inter-relationship between outdoor and indoor profiles through sections. This research identified the most error-prone measurements done by traditional approach by comparing original drawings with the final models which registered 1958 scans and sub-scans. To represent the special characteristics of as-built 3D temple form, the study includes the application of metadata in architecture, the information management of digital data, and the Internet display of large 3D data sets. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N. Joint,2007,"Data preservation, the new science and the practitioner librarian","Purpose - This paper aims to outline the information management principles of the so-called new science"", and to attempt to put these in the context of traditional library and information science principles. Design/methodology/approach - A brief review of some work in the area, in particular focusing on the work show-cased by the annual digital preservation conference series hosted by the Digital Curation Centre in Scotland (www.dcc.ac.uk/). Findings - There is a danger that scientists (as opposed to LIS professionals) will apply the information management techniques of the new science to their own activities inappropriately, especially to research that is best curated as ""old"" not new science. This is something on which information professionals are well placed to give advice and make judgements. Research limitations/implications - More practice-oriented research is needed to enhance understanding of how traditional librarianship practices can be applied to the data-intensive scientific research carried out by so-called ""virtual organisations"". Practical implications - This paper makes some initial suggestions about the how the tools of library and information practice can be related to the ""new science"". In particular, it highlights their relevance to distinguishing between the information management needs of the ""old"" and the ""new"" sciences: these needs are quite distinct, though easily confused. Originality/value - This paper relates terms from pure science such as the virtual organisation, cyberinfrastructure, and e-Science to traditional LIS concepts, and tries to create an understanding of the relationship between the two disciplines for the library practitioner."""
N. Joint,2007,"Digital information and the privatisation of knowledge""""","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to point out that past models of information ownership may not carry over to the age of digital information. The fact that public ownership of information (for example, by means of national and public library collections) created social benefits in the past does not mean that a greater degree of private sector involvement in information provision in the knowledge society of today is synonymous with an abandonment of past ideals of social information provision. Design/methodology/approach - A brief review of recent issues in digital preservation and national electronic heritage management, with an examination of the public-private sector characteristics of each issue. Findings - Private companies and philanthropic endeavours focussing on the business of digital information provision have done some things - which in the past we have associated with the public domain - remarkably well. It is probably fair to say that this has occurred against the pattern of expectation of the library profession. Research limitations/implications - The premise of this paper is that LIS research aimed at predicting future patterns of problem solving in information work should avoid the narrow use of patterns of public-private relationships inherited from a previous, print-based information order. Practical implications - This paper suggests practical ways in which the library and information profession can improve digital library services by looking to form creative partnerships with private sector problem solvers. Originality/value - This paper argues that the LIS profession should not take a doctrinaire approach to commercial company involvement in our"" information world. Librarians should facilitate collaboration between all parties, both public and private, to create original solutions to contemporary information provision problems. In this way we can help create pragmatic, non-doctrinaire solutions that really do work for the citizens of our contemporary information society."""
P. Caplan,2007,The Florida Digital Archive and DAITSS: A working preservation repository based on format migration,"The Florida Digital Archive is a long-term digital preservation repository for the use of the libraries of the public universities of Florida. It is managed by the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) and based on Dark Archive in the Sunshine State (DAITSS), repository software developed by FCLA with the aid of grant funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). DAITSS is designed to implement active preservation strategies based on format transformations including forward migration, normalization, and localization. As a case study, the Florida Digital Archive and DAITSS show that active preservation strategies can be incorporated into repository applications from the start, and that doing so affects all aspects of application design. The Florida Digital Archive has been in production since November 2005. The DAITSS application is nearing completion and will be released as open source software in 2006. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."
P. Doorn; H. Tjalsma,2007,Introduction: Archiving research data,"This article is a general introduction into the special issue of Archival Science on archiving research data"". It summarizes the different contributions and gives an overview of the main issues in this special field of archiving. One of the leading questions is how and why research data archives differ from public record offices. In the past, the developments in these two worlds have been rather separate. There are however signs that they are converging in the digital world. In particular, this can be seen in the areas of metadata and Internet dissemination as these are strongly influenced by the rapid changes in information technology. These changes have also led to important new developments in the infrastructure of research data to which special attention is paid. New concepts such as collaboratories, data curation, Open Access and the Open Archives Initiative are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."""
R. Campos,2007,Digital libraries and engines of search: New information systems in the context of the digital preservation,"The first's library projects occur some years ago with digitization, but just in 1996, the first's web archive initiatives start occurring. Such, was based in the Internet growth and in its increasing use, items that revealed to be an opportunity to transform and readapt the traditional library services. In this context, search engines play a fundamental role of support to the new paradigm of knowledge, by capturing, storing and providing access to the resources, allowing the existence of a digital library in each computer with internet access. In this article we analyze the ways of developing a digital library, taking higher attention to the web harvesting technique, and presenting digital libraries capabilities and limitations. Then we fully summarize relevant projects and initiatives, to finally study the role of search engines in what concerns to, digital preservation, access and information diffusion."
R. E. Scott,2007,e-Records in health - Preserving our future,"Introduction: Papyrus manuscripts nearly 2000 years old, can still be read, but documents composed on a Wang or other word processor just 30 years ago are gone forever. Standards and formats used for storing and accessing information are constantly changing, and the required hardware or software will likely be obsolete or no longer exist in the near future.Purpose: To understand how to urgently address the data preservation issue as we migrate to greater use of e-records, in particular 'lifetime' electronic health records (EHR's), as our primary, perhaps sole, e-record. In principle, these dynamic and critical health data must be preserved and capable of real-time access on a 7/24/365 basis for perhaps 125 years. Without forethought, only a small fraction of the data currently stored within any healthcare jurisdiction will survive for more than a decade or so, or be exchangeable between jurisdictions. The situation will only be compounded as EHR's become ubiquitous.Approach: The literature was reviewed to identify data preservation issues and potential solutions, and guide development of policy recommendations to minimise the impact of this potentially catastrophic system failure. These recommendations are directed at the practice, program, and decision-making levels, and in both the public and private sectors.Conclusion: Data preservation poses a critical barrier to e-health and future healthcare systems. At this time broad awareness of data preservation issues is poor. This paper offers policy recommendations to stimulate debate and development of suitable strategies.

R. Fox,2007,The double bind of e-journal collections,"Purpose - This paper aims to examine technology developed to aid in e-journal archiving and preservation. Design/methodology/approach - This paper examines two organizations and relevant technology which has been developed over the last five years to meet the needs of e-journal archiving and preservation. Findings - This paper is exploratory in nature and examines two potential solutions for the e-journal preservation dilemma. Practical implications - Since the advent of e-journal licensing, concerns regarding the preservation of digital born content have grown. The need to establish means to preserve this content for the future is acute. Originality/value - This paper examines the pros and cons associated with the two primary organizations, Portico and LOCKSS, regarding e-journal content preservation. It is hoped that this information will be useful to librarians and library staff who are responsible for exploring the means to implement digital preservation and will guide them to further resources which will be helpful in making an informed decision."

R. Preston,2007,Do you (still) have the real thing? Using the InterPARES 2 framework of principles to address authenticity in preservation process assessments,"Preservation process assessments assist records creators and preservers in understanding the complex regime of internal and external factors that affect the long-term care of the records under their care, while at the same time highlighting problem areas. Because of the distributed nature of digital preservation, to be effective, these assessments need to take into account issues related to the entire chain of custody, from creation through preservation, so that the authenticity of the records is maintained throughout. Doing so will require that creators and preservers develop new strategies for instituting and sustaining more active and integrated records management collaborations supported by a comprehensive and harmonized intellectual framework of policies, procedures, practices, and standards. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to introduce to professional practitioners involved in digital preservation activities, especially practitioners outside the archival community, the concept of authenticity as it has been developed during the past eight years of intensive research by the InterPARES (International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems) Project, and (2) to examine how the findings of this research, particularly the InterPARES 2 Framework of Principles, and the intellectual framework of model policies, principles and standards it supports, can help encourage and support more comprehensive and integrated preservation process assessments aimed at improving the ability of creators and preservers to establish and maintain the authenticity of the digital records, and other digital content objects, under their care."
R. Rank,2007,Enterprise IT support for NOAA archives,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for archiving and disseminating environmental data collected by a variety of ground and space-based observing systems. Integrating data management across NOAA represents a significant change in NOAA business practices that will require evolution of the management structures and approaches used in NOAA for data management. Historically, archive and dissemination activities have been implemented in dedicated stovepipe"" systems, each focusing on the needs of a particular data collection and its associated user community. Exponential data volume growth, increasing data diversity, user requirements for common and consistent access methods across data types, and the need for economic efficiency are driving a consolidation of the information technology (IT) systems that support NOAA archives. The Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) is a result of this consolidation; CLASS is the enterprise IT solution in support of NOAA archives. Against this backdrop, the meaning of ""archive"" is itself changing as the challenges of long-term digital preservation are better understood. It is no longer sufficient to simply preserve ""bits."" Instead, information content is the target of preservation, with ""bits"" simply providing a medium for representing information. The ISO standard ""Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System"" (OAIS-RM) provides a conceptual framework that describes the responsibilities and activities of organizations attempting to preserve digital information. Applying the OAIS-RM to NOAA's archive efforts provides the means to identify high-level archive responsibilities, delegate roles to various NOAA organizational components, and describe the means by which these entities work together to fulfill archive requirements. At the highest level, NOAA archives maintain and apply information- and user-specific knowledge while CLASS provides IT capabilities in support of archive activities. Together, the archives and CLASS provide the necessary ingredients to fulfill NOAA's archive mission. Currently, CLASS holds POES, DMSP, GOES, and MetOp data. Planned future campaigns include NPP, NPOESS, EOS MODIS, NEXRAD, and model and in-situ data. To ensure the preservation of these data, CLASS has implemented a multiple site distributed system that replicates data and metadata holdings automatically. Additionally, CLASS supports the deployment of ""points of presence"" that allow the co-location of key CLASS capabilities with high-volume or otherwise critical data producers or consumers to mitigate economic constraints or meet quality-of-service requirements. Among the key challenges facing CLASS are: massive increases in data volumes, the extraordinary diversity of NOAA data, evolving user needs and requirements, and the ever-changing technology environment. CLASS must address all of these challenges-and more-at the same time it ensures the safeguarding and availability of its current holdings. CLASS is evolving toward a service-orientedarchitecture that provides the flexibility, scalability, and generality necessary to accommodate the vast amount of change in its environment and at the same time provide interoperability with other systems and systems of systems necessary to support NOAA's position in the environmental data arena. Adoption of standards is critical to NOAA's success, and CLASS is working with NOAA's Global Earth Observation Integrated Data Environment (GEO-IDE) project to identify standards that will ensure CLASS's interoperability with other NOAA systems. The lack of broad, uniform utilization of IT standards that adequately meet NOAA's data integration needs is arguably the most acute factor contributing to the weakness of data integration today. GEO-IDE will ultimately ensure that key NOAA systems, including CLASS, are interoperable within NOAA, with US-Global Earth Observation System (US-GEO), and ultimately with US-Global Earth Observation System (GEOSS). In addition to its work with GEOIDE, CLASS is also dev loping pilots for geospatial capabilities, and dissemination standards to facilitate interoperability and meet user needs. This paper will present the guiding principles and lessons learned while developing CLASS to date. We will discuss our challenges, accomplishments, and future work, as well as how CLASS aligns with NOAA's strategic goals. © 2007 IEEE."""
R. W. Moore; M. Smith,2007,Automated validation of trusted digital repository assessment criteria,"The RLG/NARA trusted digital repository (TDR) certification checklist defines a set of assessment criteria for preservation environments. The criteria can be mapped into data management policies that define how a digital preservation environment is operated. We explore how the enforcement of these management policies can be automated through their characterization as rules that control preservation services. By integrating a rule-based data management system with the DSpace digital archive system, we expect to demonstrate automated audits of the TDR checklist for a defined set of local policies. The system is sufficiently general that one can also demonstrate the completeness and self-consistency of preservation environments. This is the concept that all required preservation metadata are controlled by management policies, and that for each management policy the required preservation metadata are preserved."

S. Hitchcock; T. Brody; J. M. N. Hey; L. Carr,2007,Digital preservation service provider models for institutional repositories: Towards distributed services,"Digital preservation can encompass a range of activities, from simple replication and storage to more complex transformation, depending on the assessed value and risk to the target content. These activities require planning and, in most cases, begin with a need to know the technical format of the target content. In this case, the target is the content deposited in institutional repositories (IRs). The Preserv project [1] set out to investigate the use of The National Archives' (TNA) PRONOM-DROID service (PRONOM is the online registry of technical information; DROID is the downloadable file format identification tool) for file format identification on two pilot IRs using EPrints software, and instead produced format profiles (Preserv profiles) of over 200 repositories presented via the Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR). Thus a primary element of preservation planning has been shown to be possible based on a standard Web interface (OAI) and no formal arrangement between repository and provider. The implications of this go beyond the numbers towards a reconceptualisation of repository preservation service provider models. Repositories and providers can shape preservation services at different cost levels that could range from comprehensive 'black-box' preservation to pick-and-mix lightweight Web-based services that build on the common starting point, format identification. This article describes the evolution of a series of models that have informed progress towards this conception of flexible and distributed preservation services for IRs."
S.

The notion of open access, made possible by rapidly advancing digital technologies, aims to break the limitations that hinder academic developments and information exchange. This paper presents the Electronic Thesis & Dissertation (ETD) Project at the Simon Fraser University Library, British Columbia, Canada, and discusses various technological considerations associated with the Project including selection of software, capture of metadata, and long-term preservation of the digitized data. The paper concludes that a well-established project plan that takes into account not only technological issues but also issues relating to project policies, procedures, and copyright permissions that occur in the process of providing open access plays a vital role for the overall success of such projects."
S. Little; O. Salvetti; P.

In domains such as eScience, digital curation and industrial monitoring, finegrained high-quality labeling of regions enables advanced semantic querying, analysis and aggregation and supports collaborative research. Manual annotation is inefficient and too subjective to be a viable solution. Automatic solutions are often highly domain or application specific, require large volumes of annotated training corpi and, if using a 'black box' approach, add little to the overall scientific knowledge. This article evaluates the use of simple artificial neural networks to semantically annotate micrographs and discusses the generic process chain necessary for semi-automatic semantic annotation of images."

S. Schwartze,2007,Test data and information management for a good scientific praxis and long-term usability of data,"Archives that keep data produced in an industrial or science project must handle lots of information to ensure understanding long time and between different groups of people involved. In lots of research projects formal requirements of long-term preservation of data and information must be fulfilled following a good archiving praxis due to liability. To understand long term why what was developed growing amounts of data and documents in various formats must be kept interpretable. Especially, in the early phases of a project the storage of data and documents follows the practical needs and is built up intuitively. Only some meta data are represented in folder structures and file names. The idea behind this initial nomenclature usually is lost after a while or when people involved are changing. Archiving data in that way holds the risk of at least long search times. Exchange of information amongst people involved is not supported. Moreover data get lost because they cannot be retrieved or they become worthless as they cannot be interpreted in the right way. Werum developed the platform HyperTest® that handles data and all related information through the lifecycle in a use-case specific way."

T. Mark,2007,"National and international library collaboration: Necessity, advantages","The advantages of cooperation between research library associations can be demonstrated quite clearly. Where cooperation becomes essential is where there is a common cause to champion or an initiative to pursue for the common good. Thanks in part to the power of information communications technology, research is becoming increasingly international in scope. The members of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research teams are frequently drawn from across the world. Correspondingly, scholarly publishing (especially in medicine and the sciences) is dominated by a few multinational publishers. In this context, issues that play a vital role in global scholarly communication - such as copyright, journal pricing, the managing of datasets, digital preservation and open access - are issues for the research library community everywhere in the world. Certainly there are many challenges at the local or regional level. However there are definite roles that research library associations can play most effectively at the national or international level. It is clear that by sharing expertise, building partnerships and alliances, it is possible to address common issues much more effectively than when working alone. What is special is that potentially the most powerful form of cooperation is advocacy at the national and international levels. It is essential for research library associations to work together at the political level to move their agenda forward. Examples are lobbying about copyright legislation (nationally, or within the EC or at WIPO); or promoting the cause of Open Access. The unique value of LIBER is to provide a forum and a platform for European research library associations to explore and benefit from cooperation and their shared strength. © LIBER 2007.

Kitsuregawa,2007,A method for language-specific Web crawling and its evaluation,"Many countries have created Web archiving projects aiming at long-term preservation of Web information, which is now considered precious in cultural and social aspects. However, because of its borderless character, the Web poses obstacles to comprehensively gathering information originating in a specific nation or culture. This paper proposes an efficient method for selectively collecting Web pages written in a specific language. First, a linguistic graph analysis of real Web data obtained from a large crawl is conducted in order to derive a crawling guideline, which makes use of language attributes per Web server. The guideline then is formed into a few variations of link selection strategies. Simulation-based evaluation reveals that one of the strategies, which carefully accepts newly discovered Web servers, shows superior results in terms of harvest rate/coverage and runtime efficiency. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
T. Triebsees; U. M. Borghoff,2007,A theory for model-based transformation applied to computer-supported preservation in digital archives,"Model transformation has applications in many areas as, e.g., in model-driven software development or automated knowledge exchange. When applied, model transformations usually have in common that the transformation process shall preserve certain properties. In model-driven software development, e.g., abstract models are transformed into more specific ones while preserving the behavior of the specified software system. In this paper, we present a model transformation approach that implements a preservationcentric iew. We introduce a formal preservation language that allows transformation algorithms to be computed automatically. Additionally, these generated transformations can be proven to respect specified preservation requirements. We demonstrate our approach using a systems specification example that stems from the digital archiving world. We specify a web-archiving system that consists of two components each of which uses its own website model for storage. Internal processes necessitate exchanging websites between these two components and, thus, model transformation. We apply our preservation language and show how the algorithm generation procedure generates a transformation algorithm that guarantees an unchanged external view on the transformed websites. © 2007 IEEE."
T. Triebsees; U. M. Borghoff,2007,Towards automatic document migration: Semantic preservation of embedded queries,"Archivists and librarians face an ever increasing amount of digital material. Their task is to preserve its authentic content. In the long run, this requires periodic migrations (from one format to another or from one hardware/software platform to another). Document migrations are challenging tasks where tool-support and a high degree of automation are important. A central aspect is that documents are often mutually related and, hence, a documentï semantics has to be considered in its whole context. References between documents are usually formulated in graph- or tree-based query languages like URL or XPath. A typical scenario is web-archiving where websites are stored inside a server infrastructure that can be queried from HTML-files using URLs. Migrating websites will often require link adaptation in order to preserve link consistency. Although automated and trustworthy"" preservation of link consistency is easy to postulate, it is hard to carry out, in particular, if ""trustworthy"" means ""provably working correct"". In this paper, we propose a general approach to semantically evaluating and constructing graph queries, which at the same time conform to a regular grammar, appear as part of a document's content, and access a graph structure that is specified using First- Order Predicate Logic (FOPL). In order to do so, we adapt model checking techniques by constructing suitable query automata. We integrate these techniques into our preservation framework [12] and show the feasibility of this approach using an example. We migrate a website to a specific archiving format and demonstrate the automated preservation of link-consistency. The approach shown in this paper mainly contributes to a higher degree of automation in document migration while still maintaining a high degree of ""trustworthiness"", namely ""provable correctness"".

T. Triebsees; U. M. Borghoff,2007,Towards constraint-based preservation in systems specification,"Model transformation has applications in many areas and usually is to preserve certain properties. In model-driven software development, e.g., abstract models are transformed into more specific ones while preserving the behavior of the overall specified system. In this paper we demonstrate how constraint-based preservation, which we have initially developed in the context of digital archiving, can be applied to systems specification. We demonstrate how our approach helps to preserve communication flows inside a component-based system. In particular, formal preservation constraints allow us to prove invariance of certain significant properties of a component interaction specification if the transformation process adheres to a given set of such constraints. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007."
V. Asproth,2007,Integrated information systems - A challenge for long-term digital preservation,"Information technology has led to the fact that much of the information that earlier was produced on paper is now being produced in electronic form. E-government services, where the whole idea is to exchange information electronically, will radically redirect paperbound information towards electronically generated and managed information and documents. Earlier on, long-term preservation was all about paper-bound documents containing content, context and format as well as the legal issues concerning the document, such as signatures and stamps. Although paper-bound documents still are of frequent use, the degree of digital information rapidly increases. Digital information is often compiled from different databases, where content, context, format and signatures can be separated and put together differently. The challenges associated with digital preservation are strategic, organizational and structural as well as technological. The aim of this paper is to present some challenges associated with digital preservation."
V. Asproth,2007,Long-term preservation of electronic information - A study of seven Swedish governmental organizations,"Information technology in combination with changes in organizational structures and forms for work has led to an increasing amount of information and also to totally new forms of information and records creation. Much of the information that earlier was produced on paper is now being produced in electronic form, for example as e-mail and in databases. A 10-year period is a long time when it comes to preserving electronic records. This is of course due to the rapid technological development, for example the problems with obsolete software and file formats. Vitale functions in society such as the social insurance and national registration have to be accessible for long periods of time. Without authentic, accessible, searchable, and reliable records these functions in society are in fact impossible to maintain. There still remain a lot of problems to solve before secure and efficient long-term preservation will be brought about. Digital preservation requires, in addition to the technological development, elaborated strategies, new workflows and organizational structures, standards and common metadata, new specific competences, and close co-operation across different professional fields. Though many problems still remain to be solved, governmental as well as business organizations are in an intermediate stage in the changeover to electronic records and have to deal with this situation. In this paper an empirical study of seven Swedish governmental departments is presented. The study was carried through with help of interviews and in some of the cases examination of complementary documentation. The result of the study shows the stage of changeover organizations are in, and the different strategies they use to handle the mixture of paper-bound documents, scanned documents, electronic records, databases, etc that comprise the information about one single commission or object and which has to be handled both in the short and the long run."

Ckney,2007,Multifunctional encoding system for assessment of movable cultural heritage,"This is an introductory paper of a recent EC project dealing with research in cultural heritage and aiming to communicate new fields of application for optical metrology techniques. The project is in its initial state and more conclusive information is expected to be available at the time of the perspective conference. Nowadays safety, ethical, economical and security issues as well as the increase demand for loaning of art objects for exhibitions in transit, are forcing the Conservation Community to undertake strong initiatives and actions against various types of mistreatment, damage or fraud, during transportation of movable Cultural Heritage. Therefore the interest directs to the development of innovative methodologies and instrumentation to respond to critical aspects of increased importance in cultural heritage preservation, among which of prior consideration are: to secure proper treatment, assess probable damage, fight fraud actions in transportation. The MULTIENCODE aims to create a new standard way of monitoring the condition of artworks by using the latest holographic technology. It will produce innovative methods and tools which will allow conservators to assess the conservation state of an object and the need for any treatment; illustrate any new damage; monitor the impact of transport; and confirm a piece's originality. An object would undergo transient alterations to extract its distinct holographically encoded patterns before being digitally classified and archived. The coded data can then be easily retrieved to be compared with past and any future entries to assess changes to the object. It is thus proposed in this project the development of a novel Impact Assessment Procedure (IAP) based on interferencesignal direct encoding nature by exploiting and further providing to the conservation community the holographic technology advances and innovative tools for a highly secure encoding-decoding system of objects' features required in many critical aspects for sustainable preservation of movable artworks. It may apply in many functional and strategic decision-makings in museums operation, from routine seasonal examination of conservation state, to periodic assessment of conservation treatments and materials compatibility, to deterioration control and definition of early-induced damage, to continuous monitoring of transportation impact, to direct confirmation of originality and control of maintenance for any art object in transit, etc. The effective proposed method relies on the original coded extraction of distinct features from the artwork under conservation, transportation and loan that characterizes the state of conservation of the artwork and its originality. The coding and decoding of such characteristic features can be performed holographically before and after have been optically and numerically transformed for digital archiving. The object features or the archived coded data forming the signature"" of the object can be recollected and compared through repeatable IAP at any later time to provide indication of induced alterations. The project advances the state of the art elaborating in synergy with existing methods and practices and concludes with specific novel instrumentation and standards for universal application and worldwide exploitation. The proposed method advances the state of the art elaborating in synergy with existing methods and practices and concludes with specific novel instrumentation and standards for universal application and worldwide exploitation. It would enable us to make further progress on our previous research into the deterioration of objects through handling, transport and environmental conditions."""

This approach has distinct advantages, but has also been criticized for taking too narrow a view of the dynamic diversity of the digital environment, particularly as found on the Web. To understand what digital heritage is, it is useful to look at the current debate on preservation of intangible heritage, as both share a number of characteristics.

This paper studies the impact of e-organisation of forest service records as used within the workflow in Greek Forest Service, especially in regional Forest District Offices (FDO) through the introduction of digital archiving and furthermore classified FDOs in groups (clusters) which exhibit homogeneity for their archiving and database characteristics and, consequently, similarity as it concerns efficient data archiving. Research was performed with questionnaires in regional forest offices throughout the country. The collected data concern the regional distribution and categories of record archives, the employ of archiving in partial forest bureaus, the software used for information management, its origin and evaluation of performance. Further, cluster analysis was performed in order to identify groups of forest units with common features concerning digital archiving. The digital archiving rate is found to be different among regional forest offices and it comprises various and different forest issues, yet the administration sector and relative applications predominate. Regarding clustering, two groups with similar features have been identified between forest units, one with moderate and one with excessive use of digital archiving. National information policy should focus on the effective introduction of information technology and decision support tools for environmental purposes. Group clustering concerning archiving features should be used aiming to the adaptation of a more suitable data management through archiving policy for each group of forest unit. The perspective for the design and implementation of an integrated forest service database through a public administration master plan is then discussed."

A. Cunningham,2008,Digital curation/digital archiving: A view from the national archives of Australia,"This paper considers similarities and differences among the concepts of digital curation, digital archives, and digital libraries. It argues that, from a recordkeeping perspective, the phrase digital archive has been misused, even hijacked, and that this misuse obscures fundamental issues associated with the capture and long-term management of archival resources. The paper also argues that digital archiving requires active archival intervention across the entire records continuum, and that, as such, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model is deficient because it ignores the need for pre-ingest archival activity. The paper reviews the digital archiving experiences of the National Archives of Australia (NAA), in light of the key messages outlined in the first half of the paper placing those endeavors in the broader Australasian context. These experiences include the NAA's efforts to promote and facilitate improvements in government recordkeeping, the NAA's digital preservation project, and the wider challenges of implementing total end-to-end"" digital archiving in an institution already struggling to fund its more traditional activities. It identifies the major challenges that still require resolution, such as securing access to the various skills and capabilities required for digital curation, Australian style.

As a result, many music libraries across the United States are either beginning a special collections program or are turning to these collections for digitization; as special collections often consist of older materials no longer under copyright, they become priorities for digitization, which also affords a critical preservation benefit. As these collections grow, so does the need for funding, which is essential to their proper archival storage and long-term preservation. A review of the literature finds that little research has been published in the area of special collections fundraising, particularly specific to music; therefore, this article summarizes the literature and attempts to apply it to music special collections fundraising.

A. McHugh; S. Ross; P. Innocenti; R. Ruusalepp; H. Hofman,2008,Bringing self assessment home: Repository profiling and key lines of enquiry within DRAMBORA,"Digital repositories are a manifestation of complex organizational, financial, legal, technological, procedural, and political interrelationships. Accompanying each of these are innate uncertainties, exacerbated by the relative immaturity of understanding prevalent within the digital preservation domain. Recent efforts have sought to identify core characteristics that must be demonstrable by successful digital repositories, expressed in the form of check-list documents, intended to support the processes of repository accreditation and certification. In isolation though, the available guidelines lack practical applicability; confusion over evidential requirements and difficulties associated with the diversity that exists among repositories (in terms of mandate, available resources, supported content and legal context) are particularly problematic. A gap exists between the available criteria and the ways and extent to which conformity can be demonstrated. The Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA) is a methodology for undertaking repository self assessment, developed jointly by the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) and DigitalPreservationEurope (DPE). DRAMBORA requires repositories to expose their organization, policies and infrastructures to rigorous scrutiny through a series of highly structured exercises, enabling them to build a comprehensive registry of their most pertinent risks, arranged into a structure that facilitates effective management. It draws on experiences accumulated throughout 18 evaluative pilot assessments undertaken in an internationally diverse selection of repositories, digital libraries and data centres (including institutions and services such as the UK National Digital Archive of Datasets, the National Archives of Scotland, Gallica at the National Library of France and the CERN Document Server). Other organizations, such as the British Library, have been using sections of DRAMBORA within their own risk assessment procedures. Despite the attractive benefits of a bottom up approach, there are implicit challenges posed by neglecting a more objective perspective. Following a sustained period of pilot audits undertaken by DPE, DCC and the DELOS Digital Preservation Cluster aimed at evaluating DRAMBORA, it was stated that had respective project members not been present to facilitate each assessment, and contribute their objective, external perspectives, the results may have been less useful. Consequently, DRAMBORA has developed in a number of ways, to enable knowledge transfer from the responses of comparable repositories, and incorporate more opportunities for structured question sets, or key lines of enquiry, that provoke more comprehensive awareness of the applicability of particular threats and opportunities."

If the noncontact techniques are to be considered a viable solution for sound archivists, a method for quantifying the quality of the reproduced signal needs to be developed. In this study, a specially produced test cylinder recording, encoded with sinusoids, provides the basis for the first quantitative analysis of signal reproduction from the noncontact full surface mapping method. The sampling and resolution of the measurement system are considered with respect to the requirements for digital archiving of cylinder recordings. Two different methods of audio signal estimation from a discrete groove cross section are described and rated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and total harmonic distortion. Noncontact and stylus methods of sound reproduction are then compared using the same test cylinder. It is shown that noncontact methods appear to have distinct advantages over stylus reproduction, in terms of reduced harmonic distortion and lower frequency modulation. © 2008 Acoustical Society of America."""
A. Nowak; S.

However, film is inconvenient as a universal access medium and expected to be replaced even in the cinema, whereas digital versions are widely and increasingly accepted. This article introduces the concept of a digital film archive system that uses JPEG 2000 together with the Material exchange Format (MXF). A highly scalable two-tier architecture provides a platform for long-term preservation of digital movie data in the highest possible quality and for automated access and dissemination of the stored material. All these technologies are based on open standards and therefore provide a strong foundation for this concept in which future accessibility is one of the main concerns. The different and highly customizable parameters of the two encoding and storage tiers make it possible to store the digital film images together with audio and metadata in their full original quality and to simultaneously allow for easy and automated access. The stored content can be automatically converted to all currently used professional and consumer formats for dissemination, such as digital cinema playback systems (DCPS), other projectable cinema packages, Blu-ray disks, internet streaming, etc. The concept addresses non-commercial archives, as well as commercial organizations and studios."

C. Becker; A. Rauber; V. Heydegger; J. Schnasse; M. Thaller,2008,Systematic characterisation of objects in digital preservation: The eXtensible characterisation languages,"During the last decades, digital objects have become the primary medium to create, shape, and exchange information. However, in contrast to analog objects such as books that directly represent their content, digital objects are not usable without a corresponding technical environment. The fast changes in these environments and in formats and technologies mean that digital documents have a short lifespan before they become obsolete. Digital preservation, i.e. actions to ensure longevity of digital information, thus has become a pressing challenge. The dominant strategies prevailing today are migration and emulation; for each strategy, different tools are available. When converting an object to a different representation, a validation of the content is needed to verify that the transformed objects are still authentically representing the same intellectual content. This validation so far is largely done manually, which is infeasible for large collections. Preservation planning supports decision makers in reaching accountable decisions by evaluating potential strategies against well-defined requirements. Especially the evaluation of different migration tools for digital preservation has to rely on validating the converted objects and thus on an analysis of the logical structure and the content of documents. Existing approaches for characterising and describing objects do not attempt to fully extract the informational content of digital objects and thus are not suffficient for an in-depth validation of transformed content. This paper describes the eXtensible Characterisation Languages (XCL) that support the automatic validation of document conversions and the evaluation of migration quality by hierarchically decomposing a document and representing documents from different sources in an abstract XML language. The description language XCDL provides an abstract representation of digital content in XML, while the extraction language XCEL allows an extraction engine to create such an abstract description by mapping file format structures to XCDL concepts. We present the context of the development of these languages and tools and describe the overall concept and features of the languages.

(To Stand, p 42) One of the major trends in this area is the notion of partnerships, of considering the full set of skills necessary to preserve data for the long term and recognizing that a single group or discipline does not have expertise in all aspects of digital preservation. Libraries and archives provide expertise in information management, organization and accessibility. Computer scientists and engineers provide expertise in the portfolio of technologies required to support digital preservation. Domain scientists and humanities scholars provide expertise in the content of the data to be preserved. In order to be effective, these groups must work together. © 2008 IEEE."""
C. Li; N. Ma; C. X. Xing; A. Jiang,2008,An integrated approach for smart digital preservation system based on web service,"There are massive digital resources in digital libraries and other organizations. While hardware and software used to read digital data become obsolescent soon, and a lot of information in these unreadable data is so valuable that it is urgent to preserve digital resources for long-term utilization. A variety of tools or systems can solve part of the problem, but most of them are isolated. This paper describes an integrated and flexible digital preservation system AOMS which leverages the existing tools and services. AOMS considers not only file formats and versions, but also storage media, hardware, software, OS, and so forth as digital preservation risks, so the corresponding risks may be interlaced. Consequently, AOMS also helps collection managers schedule the preservation actions effectively and efficiently. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."
C. Rusbridge,2008,"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow: Poor players on the digital curation stage","In this chapter, I will argue that there are non-obvious choices to be made about the poor players"" who manage data. In particular, the role of the librarian in this is not clear. Reg Carr (Carr, 2004) attempted to persuade his CURL colleagues at a meeting in Dublin that they should address the emerging importance of data collections head on. His efforts were accepted with enthusiasm by some, resisted by others. There were good reasons for both positions, but I argue that the latter in particular is a temporary phenomenon, strongly linked to budget constraints and to the current transitional phase of librarianship from ""mostly physical"" to ""nearly all digital"". Paul Courant, economist and ex-provost of Michigan, pointed out to a JISC/NDIIPP meeting in May 2006 that, particularly in the context of library budgets and the need to curate data: ""Theres plenty of money for anything. There just isnt plenty of money for EVERYTHING!"" Casting ones mind sufficiently far into the future, it is clear that the trend to digital is irreversible (unless the world as we know it crashes and burns), and hence in a comparatively short time,digital data as well as digital documents will become primary stuff for libraries,and the resources will adapt accordingly.Meanwhile, awkward decisions are needed, on whether to be pioneers, early adopters or late followers! But whether they want it or not, what should be the role of librarians towards data? To answer this, we need to understand a bit more about data curation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited."""
D. Giaretta,2008,Trusted data repositories,"Data is valuable, expensive to create, and may be impossible to re-create, so who can be trusted to look after it in the long term? This is a question which applies to all the types of digital data on which most astronomical research, and much of the rest of civilisation, depends. This talk will outline the work which has been, and continues to be, carried out to provide an answer to the question of how to judge whether any given data repository is tip to the task and deserves to be funded. The OAIS Reference Model (ISO 14721) forms the basis of most serious work on digital preservation and the aim of the work described here is to build on OAIS to create an international standard on which an accreditation and certification process can be based. The talk will touch on some of the fundamental ideas about preservation of digital objects and on ways to detect preservation snakeoil salesmen."
D. Gubler,2008,On the economics of microfilm - when does the blend of film & nanotechnology outpace today's electronic storage systems?,"Microfilm is a proven media. No electronic data sensor is able to store as many information in a given time frame as the photographic microfilm. Microfilm can not be manipulated without notice, and microfilm is long term stable - wouldn't microfilm be potentially interesting for electronic storage? What are the areas of application, the limitations and the costs of microfilm in today's digital preservation?Microfilm has been an accepted media in the archiving world for decades. Boosted by state of the art nanotechnology, microfilm experiences an unforeseeable revival: the formerly analog microfilm can be integrated into any digital workflow: Digital images are recorded automatically and at highest resolution and quality directly onto film while professional pre-press color management assures highest color fidelity and a trustworthy reproducibility. Also, purely digital data can as well be placed on this optical media as bit stream (Bits-on-Film). With the latter, microfilm becomes a digital data carrier like magnetic tape or a CD ROM.From a technical point of view, microfilm meets the particular requirements that are crucial to electronic storage or to document management: it offers maximum authenticity, its hardware is stable for more than 500 years, the velocity of data transfer to the media is high and the raw material is a mass product and therefore advantageously cost efficient.This presentation will, in its first chapter, derive the key requirements of long term archiving. We will distinguish between access"" ""storage"" and ""archive"" and aspects of self descriptive information decoding will be discussed. This chapter includes aspects such as Syntax, Semantics, Metadata and Information layout, specifically the layout on an optical, human readable media.In a second chapter we will derive cost drivers of digital archiving such as revolving migration costs, organizational and energy costs of electronic, server based archives.The third chapter will then present a cost model on the basis of which we will be able to calculate the efficiency of distinct archival strategies.On the basis of the chapters above, the presentation will characterize several archival portfolios and assets, archives of images as well as assets of music, movies or any electronic content (any ""bitstream""). And we will derive propositions, where and under what circumstances it is useful to work with a digitally recorded microfilm as archival media, whether to use Images-on-Film or Bits-on-Film or when microfilm is not advantageous at all.As Fachlabor Gubler AG is a service company specialized in long term archiving, we will use our practical experience within our actual archiving projects as reference for our statements. Our research in the fields of color management, information layout standardization and a R&D project for the development of a ""Bits-on-Film"" method stands for the technical background of our presentation. As Fachlabor Gabler AG operates the world's first and so far only Color Laser Microfilm Recorder, we are happy to share our first two years of experience and foremost the many application areas for laser microfilm recording."""
D. Misra; J. Seamans; G. R. Thoma,2008,Testing the scalability of a DSpace-based archive,"The implementation of production-level large scale archives is often based on research prototypes that possess essential functions and characteristics, e.g., storage capacity, ingest, metadata recording, ability to migrate to newer formats, etc. However, a key characteristic that is often overlooked is scalability, i.e., the ability of the system to accommodate large numbers of items without compromising performance - while ingesting, indexing or access. Here we describe an investigation of archive scalability in a Java-based system (System for the Preservation of Electronic Resources or SPER) which was built by an R&D team at the U.S. National Library of Medicine to investigate various aspects of digital preservation. SPER uses DSpace as the underlying infrastructure for building and managing the digital archive. To confirm the capability of SPER/DSpace to serve as a large archive, we conducted scalability tests by generating and ingesting data for more than a million items, and studied ingest behavior as a function of the archive size. This paper describes the test procedure and environment, the software developed to measure performance during ingest, and the characteristics of the ingested data. We present the ensuing results, which confirm the scalability of SPER/DSpace with acceptable ingest performance as the archive is expanded to a million items."
D. Y. Hsiao; H. Y. M. Liao,2008,Smart tone reproduction,"In this paper, we propose an effective scheme to enhance the visual details at the minimal cost of user adjustments. The uprising importance of automatic tone reproduction comes from the increasing population of digital archive programs, which contains a large number of images/videos either old, irreproducible, or poorly captured. We attempt to solve above issues by a new local normalization step and an adaptive contrast assessment process. With those two processes, our method can effectively enhance poor quality regions and simultaneously preserving good quality ones with default parameter settings. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to many existing algorithms when applied to aid digital archiving issues. ©2008 IEEE."

The infrastructure for the system, bought in 2005, is designed to support 1,5 petabytes of storage by 2014. The software components of the system are currently developped by Atos Origin. The design of the SPAR system is based on the major digital preservation standard, the OAIS model 1. The architecture is composed of several modules connected via web services and based on open source components. One of the main components of the system is the data management module: it will use RDF data stored in a RDF triple store. We explain here why RDF is relevant for digital preservation and how it will be implemented in SPAR."

Design/methodology/approach Analogies to the changes in music media along with a selection of articles between 1995 and 2008 provide the basis for a number of views from the author. The preservation portions are sorted into the three main categories of translation/conversion, migration and emulation. A conclusion to the article summarises the difficulties being faced. Findings Having the correct electronic records policies, procedures and systems that adhere to ISO 15489 is a cornerstone of an electronic record preservation programme. Stephens noted that, in practical terms, this means that any recordkeeping system, regardless of the particular technology or storage medium employed, should be designed and implemented in a manner such that its operators can demonstrate the integrity of the records if called upon to do so. Originality/value The paper provides a useful viewpoint from an experienced records manager tackling the issues of digital preservation. © 2008, "
F. McCown; M. L. Nelson,2008,Recovering a Website's server components from the Web infrastructure,"Our previous research has shown that the collective behavior of search engine caches (e.g., Google, Yahoo, Live Search) and web archives (e.g., Internet Archive) results in the uncoordinated but large-scale refreshing and migrating of web resources. Interacting with these caches and archives, which we call the Web Infrastructure (WI), allows entire websites to be reconstructed in an approach we call lazy preservation. Unfortunately, the WI only captures the client-side view of a web resource. While this may be useful for recovering much of the content of a website, it is not helpful for restoring the scripts, web server configuration, databases, and other server-side components responsible for the construction of the website's resources. This paper proposes a novel technique for storing and recovering the server-side components of a website from the WI. Using erasure codes to embed the server-side components as HTML comments throughout the website, we can effectively reconstruct all the server components of a website when only a portion of the client-side resources have been extracted from the WI. We present the results of a preliminary study that baselines the lazy preservation of ten EPrints repositories and then examines the preservation of an EPrints repository that uses the erasure code technique to store the server-side EPrints software throughout the website. We found nearly 100% of the EPrints components were recoverable from the WI just two weeks after the repository came online, and it remained recoverable four months after it was lost"".

G. Eysenbach,2008,Preserving the scholarly record with WebCite (www.webcitation.org): An archiving system for long-term digital preservation of cited webpages,"Scholars are increasingly citing electronic web references"" which are not preserved in libraries or full text archives. WebCite is a new standard for citing web references. To ""webcite"" a document involves archiving the cited Web page through www.webcitation.org and citing the WebCite permalink instead of (or in addition to) the unstable live Web page. Almost 200 journals are already using the system. We discuss the rationale for WebCite, its technology, and how scholars, editors, and publishers can benefit from the service. Citing scholars initiate an archiving process of all cited Web references, ideally before they submit a manuscript. Authors of online documents and websites which are expected to be cited by others can ensure that their work is permanently available by creating an archived copy using WebCite and providing the citation information including the WebCite link on their Web document(s). Editors should ask their authors to cache all cited Web addresses (Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs) ""prospectively"" before submitting their manuscripts to their journal. Editors and publishers should also instruct their copyeditors to cache cited Web material if the author has not done so already. Finally, WebCite can process publisher submitted ""citing articles"" (submitted for example as eXtensible Markup Language [XML] documents) to automatically archive all cited Web pages shortly before or on publication. Finally, WebCite can act as a focussed crawler, caching retrospectively references of already published articles. Copyright issues are addressed by honouring respective Internet standards (robot exclusion files, no-cache and no-archive tags). Long-term preservation is ensured by agreements with libraries and digital preservation organizations. The resulting WebCite Index may also have applications for research assessment exercises, being able to measure the impact of Web services and published Web documents through access and Web citation metrics."""

In this paper we describe an archive architecture that provides a minimal approach to the long-term preservation of digital objects based on co-archiving of object semantics, uniform representation of objects and semantics, explicit storage of all objects and semantics as files, and abstraction of the underlying storage system. This architecture ensures that digital objects can be easily migrated from archive to archive over time and that the objects can, in principle, be made usable again at any point in the future; its primary benefit is that it serves as a fallback strategy against, and as a foundation for, more sophisticated (and costly) preservation strategies. We describe an implementation of this architecture in a protoype archive running at UCSB that also incorporates a suite of ingest and access components. Copyright 2008 ACM."

Paquet,2008,Preservation metadata -A framework for 3D data based on the semantic web,"Preservation metadata, information that supports and documents the long term preservation of a digital object, is an essential component of any preservation environment that must manage knowledge over time. It describes the digital object's associated semantic information. Furthermore, in the case of preserving 3D data, it can also support future post-processing of the preserved 3D object. However, a preservation metadata framework to support semantic data associated with a 3D object is currently lacking. Developing such a framework, and anticipating what semantic information should be included within this framework, is the focus of this paper. © 2008 IEEE."
J. E. LaBarca,2008,Image storage and permanence considerations in the long-term preservation of photographic images - An update and additional considerations,"Archivists and consumers, alike, need to become aware of long-term storage and preservation issues that relate to the preservation of the data behind digital photographic images. The more obvious issues, such as accidental or catastrophic data loss and hardware format evolution, are only now being recognized in the archiving community. Consumers need to be alerted to these issues and be prepared to develop preservation strategies as well. However, longer-term issues beyond routine backup and migration of data need to be considered. The very basic solution of preservation via hardcopy images stored in shoeboxes or albums is one option, but this raises a fundamental question regarding image preservation that transcends even the more complex solutions - the long-term stability of the chosen media, whether digital or analog. This paper discusses archiving and preservation as it relates to images, and the data behind those images, along with historical perspectives and an overview of possible longer-term preservation strategies [1-3]. The importance of image permanence standards, as they relate to overall selection of preservation strategies, will also be discussed."

J. Ray,2008,"Education for digital stewardship: Librarians, archivists or curators?","The large-scale digital repositories that are emerging today and expected to increase exponentially during this century will require information managers with the skills to archive, preserve, and organize massive amounts of data for use and re-use by a variety of interdisciplinary scholarly communities over time. Where will these managers come from, and what skills will they need? This workshop, organized by the US Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) will address these questions through presentations and discussion among educators and other interested participants. IMLS has invested more than S100 million since 2003 in the education of librarians, archivists and data curators through both formal and continuing education programs. This timely funding has enabled graduate schools of library and information science to reshape their curricula to address the emerging need for digital data managers.

Recognised as a challenging but viable approach to retain long-term access to digital objects, the next step is to integrate this emulator with the operational digital archiving environment. This will offer a new and innovative long-term access solution based on emulation. To achieve this, both institutions recognised that several requirements have to be met: the organisation's policy and finance should support it; the significance of the digital collection and user requirements should be identified; software, documentation and user experiences should be preserved; preservation metadata should be captured; there should be a durable development process for emulation; and finally a technical infrastructure is needed to facilitate emulation as a long-term access strategy."

Part I,"Methods for determining overall print permanence or image stability for digital ink jet and thermal photographic prints have been well defined and are used to represent typical long-term, home storage conditions"" for consumer prints. What these methods do not take into consideration are instances where a consumer might accidentally spill substances onto unprotected prints, resulting in unwanted staining. Typical substances can range from high staining materials such as coffee to lower staining materials such as milk. In these instances, damage caused by unwanted staining could certainly impact the long-term preservation of consumer prints. To date, the only existing international standards for this type of image degradation include an ASTM procedure for stain resistance and an ISO procedure for water resistance. This article will discuss the importance of considering stain resistance as part of long-term image permanence criteria for digital consumer color prints and shortcomings associated with the current international standards. Emphasis will be placed on the rationale and development of a more robust procedure for stain resistance and a final method proposal will be made. In addition, application of the proposed method will be discussed and the results from this for several digital ink jet and thermal imaging systems will be summarized. © 2008 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""

K. Rajecki; M. Selway; B. Parks,2008,Reliable long term archiving storage architecture,"This paper is intended to address the challenges of designing a reliable long term archiving storage architecture regardless of types of digital objects needing to be stored. While the digital object types and properties should be considered when determining the storage components of the architecture, the object characteristics are not as important as the access and preservation requirements. The first step to building a long term archive storage architecture is the assessment of the business processes. Incorporating the business process into your architectural design is crucial to the overall success of the long term archive. The only way to ensure an appropriate architecture is to understand the business processes. Documenting your organizations policies and procedures including data types, length of archive, access methods, maintenance activities, and technical specifications will increase the probability your archive architecture will meet the business requirements. Whether you are building your archive for historical preservation or to store data for business compliance, a tiered storage architecture can provide you with the most reliable and cost effective solution. Regulations often require that information be located and retrieved very quickly. If architected incorrectly, data searching and retrieval can be time consuming and costly. Traditional tape only archival methods simply can not meet the access requirements of many of today's repositories and long term archives. Likewise, storing all your data on disk requires greater administration and is more costly. The proposed tiered storage architecture provides a balance between disk and tape storage hardware to support long term archiving. A reliable long term archive is also dependant on the software components being open and supporting interoperability. Storing, searching, and retrieving data is not sufficient criteria for a successful long term archive. A long term archive should incorporate open source standards based software to ensure future support. The overall storage system architecture addresses the physical storage components and processes for long-term preservation. Key components to address when architecting your long-term archive are security, storage, and application interoperability. The security layer focuses on the data access in order to ensure integrity and privacy. Storage addresses the placement of the objects within the various hardware components based on retention policies. Application interoperability is the systems and applications ability to be backward compatible as well as the ability to support expanded system functionality."
K. Yiotis,2008,Electronic theses and dissertation (ETD) repositories: What are they? Where do they come from? How do they work?,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to introduce the electronic theses and dissertation (ETD) repository as a subset of local institutional digital repositories. The paper discusses the originating institutions and organizations including Virginia Tech Initiative, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and the United States Department of Education. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is informational in nature and explores the topic of ETD repositories. It provides information relevant to academic and digital librarians interested in including an ETD repository in their institution's digital library. The paper discusses interoperability among repositories and the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. The paper discusses issues related to ETD repositories including intellectual property rights, publishers' views of ETDs as prior publications, plagiarism issues, development costs, and long-term preservation issues. Findings - It was found that library administrators who implemented ETD repositories at various universities adapted their models to the needs of their institutions and their graduate students. ETD administrators made decisions about implementation models and software and hardware infrastructure in terms of human and technical resource allocation. Practical implications - The paper argues that ETD repositories benefit students and universities by enhancing graduate education, expanding graduate research, increasing a university's visibility, and instructing students, faculty, administration, and librarians about digital technology. Originality/value - The value of this paper for digital and academic librarians concerned with EDT repositories is in providing a historical overview, a discussion of the benefits, and a review of the issues involved with implementing an ETD repository at their institution."

L. E. Campbell,2008,Doing more with less: The future of digital preservation in a constrained environment,"When one of the world's great visionaries, Thomas Jefferson, sold his personal library to the Library of Congress in 1815, he had what was then considered to be a universal library,"" not in the sense that he had every book ever published, but that his collection was universal in scope - covering all subjects of knowledge and encompassing volumes from around the world, many of them in non-English languages. Jefferson's love of knowledge and belief that all fields of endeavor and creativity were worthy of inclusion in the national library are the guiding principles upon which the Library of Congress was founded in 1800. And they guide us today as well, even though the universe of what is worth collecting has expanded far beyond anything even Jefferson could have imagined. Of course, all of you know the reason why: The digital age has led a revolution comparable to the one started by Gutenberg more than 500 years ago. We have more of everything - more books and other printed publications; media invented in the last century, such as film and sound recording; and media that only exists in bits and bytes. Through all of these information upheavals, the Library of Congress's mission has remained unchanged during its more than 200-year history, as we struggle to maintain that ""universal"" collection that Congress and the American people expect of their nation's library. The collection, storage and preservation of this inexhaustible flow of information is a problem facing all archival institutions large and small, as well as private industry, state and local governments and federal institutions. The Library of Congress can no longer collect everything, and it can no longer assume the costs of collection and storage as it did when everything we had to deal with was in analog form. We have thus formed a network of more than 100 partners from the public and private sectors to collect and preserve this content that is at risk of loss. And, just as important, the network is catalyzing a nation of digital preservation activists who will help us spread the word - as well as the technical expertise - on the importance and know-how of digital preservation."""
L. Martínez-Uribe; S. Macdonald,2008,A new role for the academic librarian: Data curation,"Academic libraries are facing a range of new challenges in the 21st century. Models of scholarly communication are experiencing a revolution with the advent of open access, with libraries adopting a lead role in self-archiving their institutional outputs in digital repositories. In addition, researchers are taking advantage of the computational power at their disposal, conducting research in innovative and collaborative ways that use and produce vast amounts of data. Such research-generated data underpins intellectual ideas, which in turn propagates new methodologies, analysis and ultimately knowledge. It is crucial that we preserve such mechanisms and output for future generations. With the experience gained from traditional cataloguing, indexing and organisational skills coupled to those acquired in developing, establishing and maintaining institutional repositories, the time is ripe for academic librarians to explore a new role. Research data need to be looked after from the moment of creation through their life cycle. The concept of data curation refers to activities like digital preservation but also those geared towards adding value to the data so that they can be discovered and reused. This article introduces e-Research and the likely function of academic libraries in this domain. After this, data curation is described and several initiatives of interest for information professionals in this field are presented."

The need to deliver cultural resources, especially frommajor cultural organizations such as museums or national libraries, has become an imperative closely associated with the core mission of these organizations to educate and elucidate, to promote and disseminate and to preserve culture. These attempts to reach out to new audiences and to refresh current audiences are major driving factors behind many digitization programmes and the shift towards digital repositories. The justifications for delivering cultural resources digitally can rarely made on purely financial grounds as the fiscal returns on investment are relatively small, but the returns for culture, education and prestige are high (Tanner, 2004). © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited."""

M. J. Grauer; I. K. Howley; J. B. Kopena; W. C. Regli,2008,Towards a format registry for engineering data,"There has been a great deal of interest recently in the problem of long term archiving of digital data. This is especially so in engineering design, where the CAD software tools evolve rapidly but the manufactured products themselves have much longer lifetimes whose support requires archived design data in a usable form. The ISO Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) Reference Model is a widely used standard for digital archiving, with an essential piece of this model being a file format registry. A file format registry is a system for housing information about file formats that allows for correct interpretation, rendering, storage, and translation of digital files. Currently there exists no file format registry specifically for CAD file formats. This paper explains the purpose of a file format registry for CAD in the greater context of digital archiving, and then presents our approach to creating a CAD file format registry using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) language of the Semantic Web. By creating our file format registry in RDF, we allow archival systems to perform automated reasoning on the stored files. We hope that this paper will increase awareness of this element of engineering design repositories in the research community of this conference. Copyright © 2007 by ASME."

M. Schott; J. Dittmann; C. Vielhauer; C. Krätzer; A. Lang,2008,Integrity and authenticity for digital long-term preservation in irods grid infrastructure,"Digital resources and documents have become part of our culture as many cultural and intellectual goods are born-digital"" - existing only in digital form. Therefore digital long-term preservation is sustaining our cultural heritage for the future. Because of its importance digital preservation is addressed by several national and international projects like the German NESTOR project [12], the US National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program [11], the IETF LTANS group ([21], [22]) and the EU FP7 SHAMAN Integrated Project [18]. Preserved resources and goods are only useful if their integrity and authenticity can be proven at any time. Although usually not made with the explicit intention to ensure integrity and authenticity in mind, in most cases both can be proven nevertheless for non-digital entities by their inherent characteristics. By their very nature, this is not the case for digital entities. Digital preservation must also ensure the integrity and authenticity of the entire preservation environment. This further imposes issues regarding the objective of digital long term preservation for at least 100 years in combination with the fast-paced developments in information technology. Many means of security used today become useless or even long forgotten in 100 years. For ensuring integrity and authenticity often electronic signatures are used and have been proposed for usage in digital preservation as in [17]. But digital signatures do not provide tamper protection or protect the integrity of data; they merely verify data integrity [3]. Although the obsolescence problem of digital signatures can be countered by a renewal of the signature, the tamper protection problem cannot be solved however. Especially in digital long-term preservation where by emulation and migration of data media breaks occur, e.g. conversion from TIFF to JPEG , digital signatures are therefore only of limited use. Regarding all these hindrances it is not unusual in the digital preservation domain to only casually address these problems. In this paper we present a first study exemplary for the SHAMAN Integrated Project. This project will be based upon the iRODS grid infrastructure using so called rules and micro-services to establish an archive environment. We propose approaches how to enforce integrity and authenticity for digital objects, collections of these, micro-services and the entire archival infrastructure exemplarily in the environment by extending the Clark-Wilson integrity model with our previously introduced Syntactic and Semantic model."""
M. Seadle; E. Greifeneder,2008,In archiving we trust: Results from a workshop at Humboldt University in Berlin,"If 25 specialists in preserving scholarly information had sat together in June of 1907 at the University of Berlin on Unter den Linden (Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin), they could likely have agreed that materials stored in the libraries of one of the world's great research universities in the capitol of the richest and most powerful state in Europe could reasonably be trusted to survive long term. One hundred years later, after the events of the twentieth century had assaulted the collections with fire, water, looters, and censorship, representatives of four digital archiving systems came together to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their systems face-to-face in front of an audience of librarians, who would have to choose whether any of these systems could be trusted to overcome the unknown events of the twenty-first century. A key conclusion was the need for interoperability and to pool efforts. An alternative to collaboration may be to let archiving systems complete on price, performance and advertising, but then as customers in that market, libraries need to think about how we can test long-term archiving, so that we have real evidence to decide whether the claims of reliability make sense.

This paper first explores the developmental paths and intersections of digital preservation and institutional repositories, considers the current status of both, and looks ahead toward the opportunities and challenges inherent in their convergent future."

It then looks at what LIBER can contribute to that landscape through portal development, funding, identifying and documenting best practice, lobbying at a European level, and managing the transition from paper to digital delivery, including the issue of digital preservation. The paper ends by trying to identify how the user will use the digitised resources which are increasingly being made available by libraries. © 2008."
P. Buonora; F. Liberati,2008,A format for digital preservation of images: A study on JPEG 2000 file robustness,"Digital preservation requires a strategy for the storage of large quantities of data, which increases dramatically when dealing with high resolution images. Typically, decision-makers must choose whether to keep terabytes of images in their original TIFF format or compress them. This can be a very difficult decision: to lose visual information though compression could be a waste of the money expended in the creation of the digital assets; however, by choosing to compress, the costs of storage will be reduced. Wavelet compression of JPEG 2000 produces a high quality image: it is an acceptable alternative to TIFF and a good strategy for the storage of large image assets. Moreover, JPEG 2000 may be considered a format that can guarantee an efficient robustness to bit errors and offers a valid quality with transmission or physical errors: this point of view is confirmed by the case study results that we report in this article, concerning image quality after occurrence of random errors by a comparison among different file formats. Easy tools and freeware software can be used to improve format robustness by duplicating file headers inside or outside the image file format, enhancing the role of JPEG 2000 as a new archival format for high quality images.

P. C. Chan; Y. C. Liao; K. A. Wang; H. H. Lin; Y. F. Chen,2008,Digital content development of folklore artifacts and activities for folklore education,"Digital preservation of museum artifacts has been widely promoted by governments around the world in recent years. However, the artifacts collected by national or local museums are not very exhaustive. Recently, the collected folklore artifacts accompanied with crafts in how to make them and skills and rituals in how to use them have been digitized in Taiwanese Folklore Museum. In order to supplement insufficiency of artifacts collected by the museum, folklore hobbyists are regularly invited to demonstrate their private collections. At the mean time, the task force of digital preservation team digitizes the artifacts for extending its contents. Another way to aggressively increase the number of digitized contents is to sign cooperation agreements with members of the folklore associations by giving services to digitize their personal collections. After having extended the digital contents, we expect that the website of Taiwanese Folklore Museum will become even more popular for teachers and students, especially in kindergartens and elementary schools, to extract and prepare useful materials for folklore education. In conclusion, the paper presents the digital contents which include folklore artifacts and folklore activities developed in Taiwan Folklore Museum. Additionally, other digital contents developed in other museums or personal collectors can be retrieved by using XML technique. The scheme supplements the insufficiency of national or local museums and provides inter-museum architecture for supporting more complete contents for folklore education. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
P. Caplan,2008,DIGITAL PRESERVATION: STANDING THE TEST OF TIME,"The capture of digital materials, whether by web harvesting, deposit to an eprint repository, or other means, is a necessary first step in making those materials accessible over time. It is, however, only a first step, and additional actions must be taken to ensure the content is uncorrupted and remains usable as hardware and software platforms change. This paper provides an overview of the objectives of long-term preservation - availability, identity, understandability, fixity, viability, renderability and authenticity - and methods for achieving them."
P. Caplan,2008,Repository to repository transfer of enriched archival information packages,"Responsibility for digital preservation must be distributed among many heterogeneous, geographically dispersed repositories. It must be possible for materials archived in one repository to be exported to and ingested by a second repository without loss of authenticity, digital provenance, or other vital preservation information. Several research and demonstration projects have focused on identifying issues in the exchange of Information packages and defining transfer formats. In the TIPR (Towards Interoperable Preservation Repositories) project recently funded by the IMLS, partners Cornell University, New York University and the Florida Center for Library Automation will take this research to the next level. TIPR will continue to test and refine the transfer mechanism while beginning to address the semantic issues of repository-to- repository transfer."
P. Conway,2008,Modeling the digital content landscape in universities,"Purpose - Digital content is a common denominator that underlies all discussions on scholarly communication, digital preservation, and asset management. This past decade has seen a distinctive evolution in thinking among stakeholders on how to assemble, care for, deliver, and ultimately preserve digital resources in a college and university environment. At first, institutional repositories promised both a technical infrastructure and a policy framework for the active management of scholarly publications. Now other approaches that take a broader view of digital content hold sway, the result being confusion rather than clarity about where digital content originates, who the stakeholders are, and how to establish and adjust asset management priorities. This article seeks to present a model for plotting the range of digital content that might be amenable to management as digital assets in higher education. Design/methodology/approach - The article reviews differing perspectives on digital content, outlines a generalized model, and suggests how the model could be used for examining the distribution of campus digital assets and fostering dialog on management priorities across stakeholder communities. Findings - A multivariate model of digital content provides a rich framework for analyzing asset management priorities in a university setting. The model should be applied and tested in a variety of university settings. Practical implications - The model is a tool for establishing asset management priorities across campus units that produce digital content. Originality/value - The paper offers an original model for evaluating the asset values of digital content produced or acquired in a university context."
P. Sefton,2008,Re-discovering repository architecture: Adding discovery as a key service,"This article proposes an architecture for institutional repositories (IRs) which is more service oriented and distributed than the typical view of a repository as a monolithic software application. The discussion is informed by first-hand case-studies from work conducted in the Australian IR scene. This article shows how a reinterpretation of the monolithic architecture could help to make the repository better able to meet its goals. Finally, the architectural features suggested in the second part are drawn together into a proposed layered architecture for repository systems centered on a discovery service with a common index of multiple application services."
P. Wullinger; C. Schlieder,2008,Digital maps of historical buildings: Preservation issues and solutions,"Built heritage preservation has been dominated for a long time by classical workflows using paper documents and especially hand drawn maps. Today, digital workflows are adopted in which domain experts record the damages of buildings and the preservation measures with special-purpose documentation software. The resulting maps are rather complex digital documents: they combine geometric data produced with CAD software and thematic data stored in an ontology. In this paper, we discuss some of the problems of long term preservation of such digital maps. One problem in the domain of built heritage preservation is the existence of multiple, inconsistent metadata schemas. We argue, that the problem is essentially an ontology alignment problem and that methods developed there are usable to solve the format mapping problem. We also illustrate with an example, why fully automated alignment is not possible in general and human interaction is typically required."

Support for the format is emerging in major consumer applications, and the cultural heritage community seriously considers it a viable format for digital preservation. So far, only commercial image servers with JPEG 2000 support have been available. They come with significant license fees and typically provide the customers with limited extensibility capabilities. Here, we introduce djatoka, an open source JPEG 2000 image server with an attractive basic feature set, and extensibility under control of the community of implementers. We describe djatoka, and point at demonstrations that feature digitized images of marvelous historical manuscripts from the collections of the British Library and the University of Ghent.

R. Gibby; A. Green,2008,Electronic legal deposit in the United Kingdom,"The Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 introduced for the first time in the United Kingdom a statutory basis for the collection by the legal deposit libraries of non-print, principally electronic, publications. Since the establishment of the Legal Deposit Advisory Panel in 2005, progress has been made in starting to turn this enabling act into reality, through a mixture of voluntary codes and statutory regulation. Work so far has concentrated on three categories of materials, offline, “free Web,” and electronic periodicals, and on the conceptual division of the remainder of the universe of electronic publications. Electronic deposit introduces several issues not present in print deposit and new dimensions to more familiar issues, including detailed involvement of the publisher in setting up the deposit process, “territoriality” (the place of publication), electronic user access, digital rights management, digital preservation, and data protection. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
R. Luckow; J. M. Turner,2008,"All singing, all talking, all digital: Media windows and archiving practice in the motion picture studios","The InterPARES 2 case study on moving images investigated the digital-archiving practices of a commercial movie studio with regard to material from a computer-generated animated feature film. The results showed that the traditional neglect of potentially useful archival materials on the part of the movie studios, is carried over into the digital world. In order to explain why good archival practice has not made economic sense to the industry over the years, we review the development of the motion picture industry in relation to cultural property, and argue that the shortsighted vision of the studios deprives them of future profitable options. We look at trends in media packaging and consumption, and speculate that untapped revenue streams currently available and unknown future possibilities provide enough economic incentive for the studios to archive their assets in a systematically organized repository. We conclude that the studios stand only to gain from implementing good archiving practice at the time of production, that the victorious players in the fast-moving and unpredictable world of media evolution will be the ones who have the help of professional archivists, and that in the process, cultural heritage materials will get better care than they have ever had before."

Yu,2008,Discussion on web archives using topic maps,"Web resources have already become the present important information channel, its pluralism abundant content to offer people for information retrieval and academia to study the needs of consulting. But web resources not only grow up quickly, but also disappear fast. Web resources will probably be unable to be utilized again because of factors such as server shutdown, revision, etc. at any time. Web resources are among the most import human societal information, including visual design art, style, and included various kinds of resources in these web pages. Due to the fragile characteristics of digital information, this study aims to address strategic, methodological and practical issues in archiving and managing digital preservation. Because the webpage may be described with the HTML edition and version, the support of the browser and long-term preservation must be considered, including standardization, format, data utilization, mining and restructured employment in the future. Based on these requirements, the main purpose of this study is analysis in probing the solution for long-term preservation of web resources; adopting the standardized method; and analyzing composition components and characteristics of web resources according to the perspective of the data structure. This study adopted the migration method to reorganize the structure but keep primitive information of web resources according to the Topic Maps metadata, in order to offer web resources integrity, management and application effectively with the whole information content."
S. Higgins,2008,The DCC curation lifecycle model,"The scientific record and the documentary heritage are increasingly created in digital form. The UK based Digital Curation Centre supports institutions who store, manage and preserve such data to help ensure its enhancement and continuing long-term use. The DCC (Digital Curation Centre) Curation Lifecycle Model provides a generic graphical high-level overview of the stages required for successful curation and preservation of digital material from initial conceptualisation. The model can be used to plan curation and preservation activities, to ensure sustainability of repository content or other digital material, within an organisation or consortium. It will help to ensure that all necessary stages are undertaken, each in the correct sequence. The model enables granular functionality to be mapped against it to define roles and responsibilities, and build a framework of standards and technologies to implement. It can help with the process of identifying additional steps which may be required, or actions which are not required by certain situations or disciplines, and of ensuring that processes and policies are adequately documented. Digital Curation Centre staff developed the model before undertaking a period of public consultation, which was recently completed. The newly ratified model will is being used by the DCC to ensure that information, services and advisory material cover all areas of the lifecycle. Domain-specific variations of the model will be developed, with greater levels of granularity, to help ensure that advice and information are easily accessible from the website. One planned utilisation is the development of domain specific standards frameworks within the DCC DIFFUSE Standards Frameworks project, to help practitioners identify which standards they should be using and where they would be appropriately implemented. This poster will present the DCC Curation Lifecycle Model, incorporating the results of the public consultation period held during December 2007 to February 2008."

S. Pénichon,2008,The making of In The American West,"In the American West was a landmark in the career of New York photographer Richard Avedon and in the history of photography. It consisted of a series of larger-than-life black-and-white portraits of men and women living in rural America, posing in front of an immaculate white background and gazing intently at the camera. Instead of playing to the traditional myth of the openness and grandeur of the West as the title might imply, Avedon had focused his camera on people who were the antithesis of that myth: miners, housewives, farmers, and drifters. The large prints were mounted onto aluminum and exhibited without glazing, which intensified the gaze of the sitters. Unveiled in 1985 at the Anion Carter Museum, which had commissioned the project, the work was acclaimed and criticized with equal fervor. This paper focuses on the materials employed and the aesthetic choices made by the artist for the printing, mounting, and display of the photographs, and their impact on the long-term preservation of the work."

Giaretta,2008,Preservation DataStores: New storage paradigm for preservation environments,"As the world becomes digital, we are in ever greater danger of losing business, scientific, artistic, cultural, and personal assets. The threat of such a digital dark age stems from the fact that unlike physical records that may survive decades, centuries, or even longer without advanced planning - digital records will not survive without planning and diligence. Everything needed to keep digital records viable will become obsolete, including hardware, software, processes, and formats. Consequently, digital preservation environments are needed to ensure the ability to access valuable digital records decades from now and, more significantly, to ensure the interpretability of the records once accessed. We describe Preservation DataStores, an innovative storage architecture that facilitates robust and optimized preservation environments. It is a layered architecture that builds upon open standards, including Open Archival Information System, XAM (Extensible Access Method), and Object-based Storage Device. We also describe the integration of Preservation DataStores with existing file systems and archives and discuss some design and implementation issues.

S. Strodl; F. Motlik; K. Stadler; A. Rauber,2008,Personal & SOHO archiving,"Digital objects require appropriate measures for digital preservation to ensure that they can be accessed and used in the near and far future. While heritage institutions have been addressing the challenges posed by digital preservation needs for some time, private users and SOHOs (Small Office/Home Office) are less prepared to handle these challenges. Yet, both have increasing amounts of data that represent considerable value, be it office documents or family photographs. Backup, common practice of home users, avoids the physical loss of data, but it does not prevent the loss of the ability to render and use the data in the long term. Research and development in the area of digital preservation is driven by memory institutions and large businesses. The available tools, services and models are developed to meet the demands of these professional settings. This paper analyses the requirements and challenges of preservation solutions for private users and SOHOs. Based on the requirements and supported by available tools and services, we are designing and implementing a home archiving system to provide digital preservation solutions specifically for digital holdings in the small office and home environment. It hides the technical complexity of digital preservation challenges and provides simple and automated services based on established best practice examples. The system combines bitstream preservation and logical preservation strategies to avoid loss of data and the ability to access and use them.

Rather than managing digitization independently of the digital repository, this article suggests that it is advantageous to work from the beginning of the digitization effort towards the end goal of long-term preservation of digital objects and related metadata in the digital repository. In particular, this article briefly examines the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration's developing approach to managing digitization projects, including: characteristics of digital objects produced during the digitization process; working data models and approaches for collecting all types of metadata to be done locally in the digitization labs and in centralized environments; where this information is held; digitization activities and influence/impact across functional areas; and discussion of how tools and processes that have been implemented at the local lab level can inform the definition and development of a centralized, institution-wide information technology infrastructure to support digitization at NARA."
S. Tominaga; N. Tanaka,2008,"Spectral image acquisition, analysis, and rendering for art paintings","We propose a technique for viewpoint and illumination-independent digital archiving of art paintings in which the painting surface is regarded as a 2-D rough surface with gloss and shading. Surface materials like oil paints are inhomogeneously dielectric with the dichromatic reflection property. The procedure for total digital archiving is divided into three main steps: acquisition, analysis, and rendering. In the first stage, we acquire images of a painting using a multiband imaging system with six spectral channels at different illumination directions. In the second stage, we estimate the surface properties of surface-spectral reflectance functions, surface normal vectors, and 3-D reflection model parameters. The principal component analysis suggests that the estimated spectral reflectances have the potential for high data compression. In the third stage, we combine all the estimates for rendering the painting under arbitrary illumination and viewing conditions. We confirm the feasibility of the proposed technique in experiments using oil paintings © 2008 SPIE and IS&T."
T. B. Hahn,2008,Mass digitization - Implications for preserving the scholarly record,"Libraries and archives have a critical role in preserving the scholarly record, many players in the publication cycle depend on them for this. Preservation of scholarly books that are being digitized has lagged far behind preservation initiatives for electronic journals. The issue has become more critical, as large commercial companies such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have begun mass digitization of millions of books in research libraries. Since December 2004, the pace of developments has been rapid, involving great risks on Google's part over the copyright issue. Google and certain participating libraries have not addressed the issue Of whether or not all this effort to digitize huge numbers of books indiscriminately will serve students' and scholars' needs in the long run. Quality, secrecy, and long-term stability are all issues that suggest it may be foolish to expect that commercial companies will share librarians' values and commitment to digitized material preservation. The information profession must exert strong leadership in setting policies, standards, and best practices for long-term preservation of the scholarly record."

Chiu,2008,A mechanism for solving the unencoded Chinese character problem on the web,"The unencoded Chinese character problem that occurs when digitizing historical Chinese documents makes digital archiving difficult. Expanding the character coding space, such as by using the Unicode Standard, does not solve the problem completely due to the extensibility of Chinese characters. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on a Chinese glyph structure database, which contains glyph expressions that represent the composition of Chinese characters. Users can search for Chinese characters through our web interface and browse the search results. Each Chinese character can be embedded in a web document using a specific Java Script code. When the web document is opened, the Java Script code will load the image of the Chinese character in an appropriate font size for display. Even if the Chinese characters are not available in the database, their images can be generated through the dynamic character composition function. As the proposed mechanism is cross-platform, users can easily access unencoded Chinese characters without installing any additional font files in their personal computers.

Since we need to capture and operate many images to map onto 3D objects, the system should be practical from the viewpoints of portability of the image capturing devices and operation automation. We proposed a novel method for color restoration that effectively applies accurate colors to digital still camera (DSC) images using a normalized cut technique based on spectral information. Our method enables us to obtain DSC images and spectral information in different illumination environments and synthesize high-resolution, accurate images. We have successfully used it to create digital archival contents. Unlike the methods available in related work, our method does not need a spectral database. We demonstrated our method and presented experimental results."
V. Heydegger,2008,Analysing the impact of file formats on data integrity,"The concept of file format is fundamental for storage of digital information. Without any formatting rules, bit sequences would be meaningless to any machine. Due to various reasons there exists an overwhelming mass of file formats in the digital world, even though only a minority has a broader relevance. Particularly in regard of specific domains like long-term preservation of digital objects, the choice of the appropriate format can be a problematic case. Thus, one of the basic questions an archivist needs to get an answer for is: Which file format is most suitable for ensuring the longevity of its information? In this study a particular criteria for long-term preservation suitability is picked up: the robustness of files according to their bit error resilience. The question we address is: Up to what extent does a file format, as a set of formatting rules, contribute to the long-term maintainability of the information content of digital objects? Or in other words: Are there any file format basing factors promoting the consistency of digital information?"

Y. C. Hsieh; H. W. Cheng; C. C. Chen,2008,"Cultural, educational, and commercial applications of digital archives","In the very beginning of the digital archive programs of museums in Taiwan, the purposes were only for culture preservation, exchange, and sharing. The government then puts more emphases on the cultural, education/learning, commercial applications and services of the digitized content. It would be a waste if we do not make the best use of the digitized content. The digitized content can be and should be used for many other areas such as digital games, digital video applications, digital publications, software applications, internet services, digital learning, mobile applications and services, computer animation, and commercial merchandise such as commodities, and cultural creative products. The main purpose of this article is to demonstrate how the ACT (Arts, Creativity, Technology) Media Lab in the Department of Graphic Communication Arts at the National Taiwan University of Arts (NTUA) utilized the digital archives licensed from the Museum of World Religions (MWR) to develop cultural, educational, and commercial merchandise in cooperation with two local manufacturer in Taipei, Bright Idea Co., Ltd. This project was funded by the Council of Culture Affairs (CCA) under a specially granted project named Creative Value-added Applications of Digital Archiving and Digital Licensing of 2006"". The licensed digital content of this project were a rich and vivid collection of Taiwanese folk religious objects and images, publication, audio, and video archived by the Museum of World Religions (http://www.mwr.org.tw/library/ch.htm). Particularly, more than 200 high resolution images of Taiwanese folk cultured artifacts were licensed to develop merchandise in the areas of commodities, creative merchandise, and education/learning/research digital product (e-books). The main roles of the ACT Media Lab in the project were the coordinator of the project, the image and product designer, digital merchandise producer such as animation film and e-books (digital to digital application), and the main marketing strategy and promotion activity planner. The Bright Idea Company was the manufacturer of commodities and creative merchandise (digital to analog application). An official website (http://gca-server.ntua.edu.tw:9000) constructed by the ACT Media Lab displays all the information about the project. A database containing the detailed information and metadata related to the digital archives of the Museum of World Religions could be found in the project website. All the merchandises developed by the project can be purchased at the souvenirs store of the Museum of World Religions in Taipei or they can be browsed and purchased online through the e-commerce platform established within the project website. This government-academy-industry collaboration project has created a new business model and generalized certain amount of profit; the most important of all, the profit has been reimbursed to all the parties participated in this project including the content providers (MWR). The success of this project (model) has been used by the CCA to promote the idea of utilizing licensed digital content to create added value for museums. With the development of digital technology and commercial applications of digital archives, museums have better chances of reaching out to the public and make known to the public.

Tryfonopoulos,2009,EverLast: A distributed architecture for preserving the web,"The World Wide Web has become a key source of knowledge pertaining to almost every walk of life. Unfortunately, much of data on the Web is highly ephemeral in nature, with more than 50-80% of content estimated to be changing within a short time. Continuing the pioneering efforts of many national (digital) libraries, organizations such as the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), the Internet Archive (IA) and the European Archive (EA) have been tirelessly working towards preserving the ever changing Web. However, while these web archiving efforts have paid signi ficant attention towards long term preservation of Web data, they have paid little attention to developing an globalscale infrastructure for collecting, archiving, and performing historical analyzes on the collected data. Based on insights from our recent work on building text analytics for Web Archives, we propose EverLast, a scalable distributed framework for next generation Web archival and temporal text analytics over the archive. Our system is built on a looselycoupled distributed architecture that can be deployed over large-scale peer-to-peer networks. In this way, we allow the integration of many archival efforts taken mainly at a national level by national digital libraries. Key features of EverLast include support of time-based text search & analysis and the use of human-assisted archive gathering. In this paper, we outline the overall architecture of EverLast, and present some promising preliminary results. Copyright 2009 ACM."

A. Dappert; A. Farquhar,2009,Significance is in the eye of the stakeholder,"Custodians of digital content take action when the material that they are responsible for is threatened by, for example, obsolescence or deterioration. At first glance, ideal preservation actions retain every aspect of the original objects with the highest level of fidelity. Achieving this goal can, however, be costly, infeasible, and sometimes even undesirable. As a result, custodians must focus their attention on preserving the most significant characteristics of the content, even at the cost of sacrificing less important ones. The concept of significant characteristics has become prominent within the digital preservation community to capture this key goal. As is often the case in an emerging field, however, the term has become over-loaded and remains ill-defined. In this paper, we unpack the meaning that lies behind the phrase, analyze the domain, and introduce clear terminology. © 2009 Springer."
A. Goethals,2009,Meeting the preservation demand responsibly = Lowering the ingest bar?,"This paper describes (I) a lessening of restrictions on the ingest acceptance criterio, and (2) a growing reliance on repository-supplied Submission Information Package (SIP) creation loolsplannedfor the Harvard University Library's digital preservation repository (the DRS). Reasons for these changes include producer demand for the repository to accept new formats and genres, growing quantities of digital coment producers want to preserve bui can noi adequately process, and the increase in the amounl of coment that is acquired by instead of created by DRS producers. In response to these needs the DRS will greatly change its SIP requirements and ingest process. Most notably fdes in any format will be accepted by the DRS. This paper describes steps taken to mitigate the effect of these changes so that the DRS can stili meet its preservation commitments while broadening the range of acceptable coment. One of these mitigating steps is the development of a new tool, FITS, which will be used to automale format identificalion and metadata extraction during SIP creation."

A. Ismail; A. Jamaludin,2009,Towards establishing a framework for managing trusted records in the electronic environment,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to attempt to establish a framework for managing trusted records in the electronic environment. Design/methodology/approach - The study collates the criteria required to manage trusted electronic records through the available literature and best practice and tests these on experts through an opinion survey. The study was done via email inviting 40 selected experts (18 participated), known in the fields of records and archives management all over the world, to respond to a structured framework of managing electronic records. Findings - The findings indicate that the experts are unanimously agreed that the five main contexts, namely governance, recordkeeping, archival, technological, skills and competency, serve as an audit list providing the trusted environment for managing records in the electronic environment. Research limitations/implications - The collation of the criteria for trusted electronic records management, based on available literature and best practice in the field, may not be exhaustive as new literature on the latest information and knowledge, debates and practices continues to emerge throughout the records and archives community. Practical implications - The study's findings are significant in confirming that the criteria collated are highly recommended and crucial in ensuring the reliability, authenticity, integrity and long term accessibility of electronic records. Originality/value - The study establishes the elements in building trusted management of electronic records. This framework provides a basis for good records management practices to ensure that electronic records are to be managed in an efficient and consistent manner. This is vital for the long-term preservation of those records with continuing value or as the evidence of transactions and the accountability that the records held for their current use. © ."

The manuscripts are facing several problems, including (a) the lack of trained manuscript librarians; (b) budgetary constraints in manual and digital preservation initiatives; (c) the problems in storage and maintenance of the collection; (d) restricted access for users, (e) the need to preserve the fragile manuscripts, (e) the difficulty of undertaking collaborative transliteration work because of the access problems; (f) the dispersal of titles at several repositories which exacerbates the access issue; and (g) a lack of detail in the description in the manuscript library catalogues. The objectives of this study are: (a) to find out the current state of manuscript collection management and practices in selected libraries; (b) to identify the problems faced by manuscript repositories; (c) to study the metadata schema used by repositories to describe their manuscript collections, and (d) to identify a suitable open source digital library software to support a digital library of manuscripts. The study gathers qualitative data from an open-ended questionnaire distributed to five manuscript librarians in Malaysia. Cataloguing practices in manuscript repositories were observed and the open-source digital library software Greenstone was studied for its suitability. The information gathered and observed which helped determine the requirements of a digital library that empowers repositories in building, storing, preserving and disseminating information about manuscript collections is presented. The design and modules of the digital library are described."

Document consultation is another problem that leads to additional deterioration. Multiple copies of high resolutions scans stored in a distributed environment and made available for consultation with a easy to use interface is a means to guarantee conservation of cultural heritage. Grid authentication and authorisation mechanisms allow a fine-grained access to archives by single users, groups or entire communities. Moreover, metadata services permit a structured organisation of scanned files for quick searches.Two use cases have been considered to demonstrate how grid digital libraries can guarantee enduring preservation of literary heritage: the archives of the work of Italian writer Federico De Roberto, made up of almost 8000 scans, and the musical and the musical archives of the Civilta Musicale Napoletana"" project, made up of more than 250,000 digitizations.A working prototype of the De Roberto digital repository has been implemented on the gLibrary platform, a grid-based system to host and manage digital libraries developed by INFN Catania, on the Sicilian e-infrastructure of the COMETA consortium."""

B. Lessard,2009,Between creation and preservation: The aNARCHIVE project,"This article is concerned with the pioneering digital archive of media arts ANARCHIVE, which is supervised by Anne-Marie Duguet (Université de Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne/University of New South Wales). Digitally archiving the works of media and video artists Antonio Muntadas (Muntadas Media Architecture Installations, 1999), Michael Snow (Digital Snow, 2002), Thierry Kuntzel (Title TK, 2006), and Jean Otth (Autour du Concile de Nicée, 2008), ANARCHIVE currently consists of one CD-ROM and three DVD-ROMs that include an important database of a given artist's oeuvre and that attest to the relational potential of digital archiving. Offering another type of digital archive than the ones found online, ANARCHIVE provides the user with what is arguably the most original form of digital archive today in the fields of contemporary and media arts. The rise of digital archives has accompanied a number of critical efforts that inquire into the ontological nature of the artefact once it has been 'dematerialized'. More than a question of materiality or lack thereof, I wish to show that a project such as ANARCHIVE introduces another way of conceiving of cultural memory and digital preservation in the age of new media. Indeed, what such a project demonstrates is that relational aesthetics has come to occupy a more central role than materiality in the appreciation and preservation of cultural and media memories."
B. Oztan; G. Sharma; A. Pasupuleti; P. R. Mukund,2009,Processing of degraded documents for long-term archival using Waferfiche™ technology,"Adaptive binarization techniques are proposed for the restoration of degraded documents for Waferfiche™ archival. Waferfiche™ is a compact archival solution for long-term preservation of documents in a human-accessible image based format. Bi-level images are preferable for the lithographic fabrication utilized in Waferfiche™ production. Binarization of degraded documents poses challenges due to the tonal variations in the foreground text and background paper. Using dispersion and edge based measures, our methods are specifically optimized for preserving information while eliminating unwanted noise. In addition, we present several pre/post-processing techniques that improve image quality. The effectiveness of our methodology is experimentally demonstrated by images captured from Waferfiches. Adaptive binarization using dispersion and edge based noise elimination thus provide an effective restoration method for degraded documents for Waferfiche™ archival."

C. A. Lee; R. Marciano; C. Y. Hou; C. Shah,2009,From harvesting to cultivating: Transformation of a web collecting system into a robust curation environment,"Much has been written about the lifecycle of digital objects. This study is instead concerned with the lifecycle of collections and associated services. Online collection environments are built to fulfill specific collecting objectives and constraints. If a collection proves useful within its original hosting environment, it will often be necessary or desirable to move the collection to new environments, in order to support new forms of use and reaggregation or extract resources from legacy data environments. Such a transformation can be extremely expensive, challenging and prone to error, especially if the collections include complex internal structures and services. When services make the repository"" moving raw data from one location to another will often not be sufficient. Digital curators can pre-empt costly and problematic system migration efforts by integrating collections into environments specifically designed to support long-term preservation, scalability and interoperability. We report on an integration of content and functionality of a feature-rich collecting environment (ContextMiner) into a robust data curation environment (iRODS)."""
C. Becker; A. Rauber,2009,Requirements modelling and evaluation for digital preservation: A COTS selection method based on controlled experimentation,"Most methods for the general problem of Commercial-off-the-shelf component selection use goal-oriented requirements modelling and multi-criteria decision making techniques and are applicable across a wide range of domains. This usually implies high levels of complexity. Recently a very specific selection problem emerged in the context of digital preservation. The selection of the most suitable tool to keep a type of digital object alive when the original technical environment ceases to exist is a highly complex domain-specific selection problem with several peculiarities: Highly homogeneous functionality across tools, complex evaluation of quality across settings, and a high need for automation, standardisation, and documentation. This paper describes an evidence-based empirical methodology for COTS component selection in digital preservation through controlled experimentation. We describe the specific selection problem, show how the process of utility analysis can be tailored to fit the problem space and describe the methodology, which is geared towards automated evaluation in an empirical setting. We outline existing tool support and discuss case studies and future directions. Copyright 2009 ACM."
C. Becker; H. Kulovits; M. Guttenbrunner; S. Strodl; A. Rauber; H. Hofman,2009,Systematic planning for digital preservation: Evaluating potential strategies and building preservation plans,"A number of approaches have been proposed for the problem of digital preservation, and the number of tools offering solutions is steadily increasing. However, the decision making procedures are still largely ad-hoc actions. Especially, the process of selecting the most suitable preservation action tool as one of the key issues in preservation planning has not been sufficiently standardised in practice. The Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) model and corresponding criteria catalogues for trustworthy repositories specify requirements that such a process should fulfill, but do not provide concrete guidance. This article describes a systematic approach for evaluating potential alternatives for preservation actions and building thoroughly defined, accountable preservation plans for keeping digital content alive over time. In this approach, preservation planners empirically evaluate potential action components in a controlled environment and select the most suitable one with respect to the particular requirements of a given setting. The method follows a variation of utility analysis to support multi-criteria decision making procedures in digital preservation planning. The selection procedure leads to well-documented, well-argued and transparent decisions that can be reproduced and revisited at a later point of time. We describe the context and foundation of the approach, discuss the definition of a preservation plan and describe the components that we consider necessary to constitute a solid and complete preservation plan. We then describe a repeatable workflow for accountable decision making in preservation planning. We analyse and discuss experiences in applying this workflow in case studies. We further set the approach in relation to the OAIS model and show how it supports criteria for trustworthy repositories. Finally, we present a planning tool supporting the workflow and point out directions for future research. © 2009 Springer-Verlag."
C. Becker; H. Kulovits; M. Kraxner; R. Gottardi; A. Rauber; R. Welte,2009,Adding quality-awareness to evaluate migration web-services and remote emulation for digital preservation,"Digital libraries are increasingly relying on distributed services to support increasingly complex tasks such as retrieval or preservation. While there is a growing body of services for migrating digital objects into safer formats to ensure their long-term accessability, the quality of these services is often unknown. Moreover, emulation as the major alternative preservation strategy is often neglected due to the complex setup procedures that are necessary for testing emulation. However, thorough evaluation of the complete set of potential strategies in a quantified and repeatable way is considered of vital importance for trustworthy decision making in digital preservation planning. This paper presents a preservation action monitoring infrastructure that combines provider-side service instrumentation and quality measurement of migration web services with remote access to emulation. Tools are monitored during execution, and both their runtime characteristics and the quality of their results are measured transparently. We present the architecture of the presented framework and discuss results from experiments on migration and emulation services. © 2009 Springer."

However, as digital image files and their metadata are usually independent, applications dealing with them have proven to be relatively complicated. This research attempts to develop metadata storage and exchange through extended techniques of embedded metadata, in order to combine information about files with the files themselves and further extend and control other related information. An Embedded Metadata Framework (EMF) structure will be planned as a reference platform for development of embedded metadata in the digital archive system. Finally, remaining problems to be overcome in such applications will be identified for future research."
C. Insley,2009,Archives and lay documentary practice in the Anglo-Saxon world,"As previous chapters have traced continental documentary practices that moved fairly seamlessly between lay and ecclesiastical settings, it is instructive to examine the evidence from Anglo-Saxon England from this new perspective. Although it preserves no lay archive as such, England offers evidence substantial enough to allow us to detect some of the outlines of a cohesive documentary culture that included the laity. Exceptional survivals like the Fonthill Letter point to the intensive use of documents, as well as to historical developments that have shaped the surviving corpus, which is dominated by royal diplomas preserved by major monastic houses and bishoprics. Traces of the operation of documents in property disputes, coupled with the evidence for a lively traffic in land, indicate how common documents must have been; they also attest to a culture in which laypeople routinely handled and kept them. The elite probably had quite sophisticated archival methods. The forces shaping long-term preservation, especially after 1066, tended to preserve some types of document – such as Latin royal diplomas for major monasteries – and discouraged the retention of others – in particular, vernacular documents like leases – that must once have proliferated. In the early tenth century, probably in its second decade, a West Saxon ealdorman, Ordlaf, sat down and either wrote or dictated an account of the recent wrangling over an estate at Fonthill, in Wiltshire, and the crimes of a man called Helmstan. The ‘Fonthill Letter’, as it has become known, now preserved in the archives of the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral, is one of the great documentary treasures of the Anglo-Saxon period. As one might expect, it has seen the expenditure of a great deal of scholarly ink, for it is one of the best witnesses to the nuts-and-bolts functioning of criminal justice in Anglo-Saxon England, and so of quite exceptional importance in the effort to understand its culture of document use. © Cambridge University Press 2013."
C. L. Cartledge; M. L. Nelson,2009,Unsupervised creation of small world networks for the preservation of digital objects,"The prevailing model for digital preservation is that archives should be similar to a fortress"": a large, protective infrastructure built to defend a relatively small collection of data from attack by external forces. Such projects are a luxury, suitable only for limited collections of known importance and requiring significant institutional commitment for sustainability. In previous research, we have shown the web infrastructure (i.e., search engine caches, web archives) refreshes and migrates web content in bulk as side-effects of their user-services, and these results can be mined as a useful, but passive preservation service. Our current research involves a number of questions resulting from removing the implicit assumption that web-based data objects must passively await curatorial services: What if data objects were not tethered to repositories? What are the implications if the content were actively seeking out and injecting itself into the web infrastructure (i.e., search engine caches, web archives)? All of this leads to our primary research question: Can we create objects that preserve themselves more effectively than repositories or web infrastructure can? Copyright 2009 ACM."""

With its key components for still images published officially by the ISO/IEC by 2002, it has been solidly stable for several years now, yet its adoption has been considered tenuous enough to cause imaging software developers to question the need for continued support. Digital archiving and preservation professionals must rely on solid standards, so in the fall of 2008 the authors undertook a survey among implementers (and potential implementers) to capture a snapshot of JPEG 2000's status, with an eye toward gauging its perception within this community. The survey results revealed several key areas that JPEG 2000's user community will need to have addressed in order to further enhance adoption of the standard, including perspectives from cultural institutions that have adopted it already, as well as insights from institutions that do not have it in their workflows to date. Current users were concerned about limited compatible software capabilities with an eye toward needed enhancements. They realized also that there in much room for improvement in the area of educating and informing the cultural heritage community about the advantages of JPEG 2000. A small set of users, in addition, perceived problems of cross-codec consistency and future file migration issues. Responses from non-users disclosed that there were lingering questions surrounding the format and its stability and permanence. This was stoked largely by a dearth of currently available software functionality, from the point of initial capture and manipulation on through to delivery to online users."
D. Dubin; J. Futrelle; J. Plutchak; J. Eke,2009,"Preserving meaning, not just objects: Semantics and digital preservation","The ECHO DEPository project is a digital preservation research and development project funded by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) and administered by the Library of Congress. A key goal of this project is to investigate both practical solutions for supporting digital preservation activities today, and the more fundamental research questions underlying the development of the next generation of digital preservation systems. To support on-the-ground preservation efforts in existing technical and organizational environments, we have developed tools to help curators collect and manage Web-based digital resources, such as the Web Archives Workbench (Kaczmarek et al., 2008), and to enhance existing repositories' support for interoperability and emerging preservation standards, such as the Hub and Spoke Tool Suite (Habing et al., 2008). In the longer term, however, we recognize that successful digital preservation activities will require a more precise and complete account of the meaning of relationships within and among digital objects. This article describes project efforts to identify the core underlying semantic issues affecting long-term digital preservation, and to model how semantic inference may help next-generation archives head off long-term preservation risks."
D. G.

The challenges of long-term access issues are multifaceted, often requires a mixture of approaches. The Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) has been extremely influential on providing a core"" set of preservation metadata elements that support the digital preservation process. However, there is no evidence, in the form of previous research, as to what factors explain and predict the leve! of adoption of PREMIS. This paper will present some preliminary result on factors that affect the adoption of PREMIS in cultural heritage institutions. The study employed a web-based survey to collect data from 123 participants in 20 country as well as a semi-structured, follow-up telephone interview with a smaller sample of the survey respondents. Roger's diffusion of innovation theory was used as a theoretical framework. The main constructs considered for the study were relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability, and institution readiness. The study yielded both qualitative and quantitative data, and preliminary analysis showed that ali six factors influence the adoption of PREMIS in varying degrees."""
D. G. Dorner,2009,Public sector readiness for digital preservation in New Zealand: The rate of adoption of an innovation in records management practices,"Recent legislation in New Zealand has placed statutory obligations on its government organizations to introduce sound records management practices and to ensure long-term access to their digital records. To obtain a base level of knowledge on current digital preservation practices and on awareness of digital preservation issues, an online survey was conducted of the nation's government organizations in March 2006. The survey, which achieved a response rate of 42.4%, found that most organizations were knowledgeable about basic aspects of their digital resources but their awareness of digital preservation was generally low, and digital preservation activity was modest overall. To identify possible reasons for this situation, Rogers' (Diffusion of innovations. 5th ed. New York: Free Press. 2003) Diffusion of Innovations model is used to discuss digital preservation as an innovation and the level of readiness for digital preservation as the innovation's rate of adoption. The paper concludes by using Rogers' model as the basis for making recommendations aimed at helping the government's lead agencies to increase New Zealand's public sector readiness for digital preservation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

We advocate open repositories of scientifically authenticated 3D models based on the example of traditional scholarly journals, with standard mechanisms for preservation, peer review, publication, updating, and dissemination of the 3D models. However, fully realizing this vision will require addressing a number of related research challenges. In this article, we first give a brief background of the virtual heritage discipline, and characterize the need for centralized 3D archives, including a preliminary needs assessment survey of virtual heritage practitioners. Then we describe several existing 3D cultural heritage repositories, and enumerate a number of technical research challenges that should be addressed to realize an ideal archive. These challenges include digital rights management for the 3D models, clear depiction of uncertainty in 3D reconstructions, version control for 3D models, effective metadata structures, long-term preservation, interoperability, and 3D searching. Other concerns are provision for the application of computational analysis tools, and the organizational structure of a peer-reviewed 3D model archive. © 2009 ACM."

D. Nicholson; M. Dobreva,2009,Beyond OAIS: Towards a reliable and consistent digital preservation implementation framework,"Current work in digital preservation (DP) is dominated by the Open Archival Information System"" (OAIS) reference framework specified by the international standard ISO 14721:2003. This is a useful aid to understanding the concepts, main functional components and the basic data flows within a DP system, but does not give specific guidance on implementation-level issues. In this paper we suggest that there is a need for a reference architecture which goes beyond OAIS to address such implementation- level issues - to specify minimum requirements in respect of the policies, processes, and metadata required to measure and validate repository trustworthiness in respect of the authenticity, integrity, renderability, meaning, and retrievability of the digital materials preserved. The suggestion is not that a particular way of implementing OAIS be specified, but, rather that general guidelines on implementation are required if the term ""OAIS-compliant"" is to be meaningful in the sense of giving an assurance of attaining and maintaining an operationally adequate or better level of long-term reliability, consistency, and cross- compatibility in implemented DP systems that is measurable, verifiable, manageable, and (as far as possible) future-proofed. © 2009 IEEE."""

E. Balnaves; M. Chehade,2009,Smart Client approaches to digital archiving of e-journals,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a research project undertaken by Prosentient Systems and partially funded by the ALIA 2007 research study grant. The focus of the project was a proof-of-concept implementation of a Smart Client application for digital archiving of e-journal subscriptions held by special libraries. Design/methodology/approach - This research comprised a survey of libraries in the area of electronic journal archiving and software development research. The quantitative survey was distributed to 254 member libraries of the GratisNet and GLASS special library networks in Australia. Seven questions explored current practice in e-journal archiving. In total, 164 responses were received, of which only seven indicated current progress toward e-journal archiving. Based on the survey results, the second phase of the project comprised software development research. Findings - The research outcomes indicate that a cross-platform Smart Client"" approach to e-journal archiving is achievable and the presentation will review architectural design techniques that support cross-platform deployment and simple installation using open source smart client tools. Practical implications - The transition to e-journal subscriptions has not been matched with attention to methods for local archiving of e-journal subscriptions. This research demonstrates the feasibility of simple solutions suitable for special libraries to implement local e-journal archives. Originality/value - This research presents an innovative approach to e-journal archiving for special libraries. The approach differs from current, peer-to-peer approach by implementing a central metadata server and a simple easy to deploy desktop archiving agent. Furthermore, limitations imposed by copyright restrictions are the principal impediment that libraries face in implementing e-journal archives, and the centralised metadata approach can help libraries distinguish journals for which local archiving is allowed. © ."""
E. Borglund; K. Anderson; G. Samuelsson,2009,How requirements of record managers change after implementing new electronic records management systems,"Swedish strategies and legislation that govern the management of records and archives in organizations have their roots in an analogue and paper-based environment. Today, very few records are created on paper: the majority of records are born digital, but they may be transformed to analogue form to fit organizational business needs and workflow. In a records management system of the highest quality electronic records should be maintained in their digital format to preserve context, digital links and dynamic relationships among information held in databases and multimedia documents. These relationships are frequently lost in any attempt to transfer to analogue form, thus compromising best practice records management standards. To meet the new need for managing born-digital records, many organizations have implemented electronic record management systems, and the effect of those implementations has gained interest from researchers, but it is not solely a software system that is needed to give a capacity of electronic record management. The ISO 15489 Standard for Records Management argues that the organizational structure and work processes affect how well the organization is able to manage their electronic records. This paper is based upon a research in a Swedish municipality, which carried out a comprehensive change management process to increase their capacity to manage electronic records, both for supporting business needs and long-term preservation needs. There is very little archival literature that focuses on how the roles of both archivists and record managers change, for example as a consequence of implementing electronic document management systems, and the organization becomes a process-oriented organization. The purpose of this paper aims to increase knowledge of the way the records managers need to change their work in order to meet the requirements generated by increased capacity in electronic records management. The research is based upon a qualitative approach where questionnaires, individual interviews, and group interviews have been used as data collection techniques. The research is in progress and has not yet fully been analyzed. However, the preliminary results indicate that the records managers need to act more proactively to meet the new system's requirements of them. The importance of the records managers' role in the municipality has become clearer and their competence is acknowledged as being more important as a result of this change management process in the municipality. The records managers are important in the sense that they know what information and what records are created, received and needed in different parts of the municipality. Records managers' record keeping"" responsibilities have been better defined after this change process and their role in relation to areas that were traditionally the responsibility of archivists has also been more clearly delineated."""
E. Crook,2009,Web archiving in a Web 2.0 world,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current state of web archiving in Australia, and how libraries are adapting their services in recognition of the expanding role that online material plays in their collections. Design/methodology/approach - The National Library of Australia is the lead institution for digital archiving and preservation in Australia. Its PANDORA Archive has been the repository for archived web resources in Australia for over ten years and is a mature but continually developing system. The archival management system PANDAS that underpins the Archive, is as of 2007, in its third major revision. Other web archiving activities also now include annual Australian Domain Harvests and the usage of Archive-It, both of which are conducted in conjunction with the Internet Archive. Findings - For many years it was considered that archiving could only ever completely capture a small, albeit representative, sample of the internet. Today the gap between what is available and what can be archived is decreasing. But as our archives and our archiving abilities increase, we are still confronted by new technologies and Web 2.0 applications. Originality/value - Using as an example the 2007 Federal Election in which a large number of interactive sites such as Kevin07, MySpace and YouTube were archived the paper shows how Australian web archivers continue to adapt to and meet new challenges. © ."

In particular, data produced in e-Science domains could be reliably stored in today's data grids, taking advantage of the natural properties of this kind of infrastructure to support redundancy. However, to achieve reliability we must take into account failure interdependency. Taking into account the fact that correlated failures can affect multiple components and potentially cause complete loss of data, we propose a solution to evaluate redundancy strategies in the context of heterogeneous environments such as data grids. This solution is based on a simulation engine that can be used not only to support the process of designing the preservation environment and related policies, but also later on to observe and control the deployed system.

The project intents to use the software and social techniques developed for Internet applications to handle large number of very different kind of documents. The project also adopts and develops techniques to combine conventional content management systems using relational database and file-based systems. The primary collection of NAVA is the legal deposit of the programs of six television and three radio channels. However, several other valuable audiovisual contents are offered by content owners and embedded as special collections for long-term preservation. The applied research project was initiated by the data management problems that we met while integrating the special collections with very different quantity and quality of rnetadata, however, usability issues were also included.

H. M. Gladney,2009,Long-term preservation of digital records: Trustworthy digital objects,"The proper entities for archival attention are patterns inherent in transmitted and stored messages. Most digital archival repository technology-what private sector enterprises call content management (CM) technology-has been thoroughly understood and widely deployed for more than a decade. This technology is not adequate for long-term digital preservation because it includes no mechanisms for reliably assuring authenticity and intelligibility of digital documents for fifty years or longer. CM provides for near-term preservation without handling long-term preservation, which must overcome risks associated with technological obsolescence and fading human memory. This article offers a solution to mitigate these risks. Implementing the needed software would be a small addition to widely deployed CM offerings. This long-term preservation solution, devised for cultural and scholarly digital documents, is already structured to support archival principles for business records, and the article describes this Trustworthy Digital Object (TDO) architecture and its design core sufficiently to show how archivists can participate in managing digital repositories that conform and are attuned to the particular needs of any archival institution."
H. Quisbert; M. Korenkova; A.

Information lives longer than people, tools (software) and organizations live. The Information Continuum Model provides support for this standpoint. However, we find that there exists no concept to support practical action in preservation from the information perspective. Existing concepts as information object, digital object, preservation object, electronic record, information package and significant properties are context dependent and focus on the object to be preserved, rather than preservation of information. Consequently, they are not suitable for realizing the information perspective in long-term digital preservation. The concept of Digital Information Preservation Object is therefore introduced and a tentative definition of the concept is presented. © 2009 Springer US."

This knowledge is critical for products and decision-support tools that utilize real-time data, and it is also essential for the longer term application of data as well. Guidance by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for appraising observational data for archive states that factors favoring long-term or permanent retention include the uniqueness, completeness, and quality of observational data and the quality and completeness of metadata [1]. The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), the designated archive center for oceanographic data in the U.S., requires that data submitted be documented to enable secondary use and ensure data posterity. Such metadata should include not only geospatial characteristics and time periods of observations, but also the collection methods, instrumentation used, units of measure, acceptable values, error tolerance, processing history, quality assessments and explanations of quality flags, data aggregation methods, and other pertinent information [2]. Providing this information in a consistent manner can be a challenge. However, an approach to capturing and conveying this metadata using community-developed practices for ocean observing system data and metadata is well underway.This paper presents methods of capturing data and provenance of data quality using the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. It describes the types of metadata content captured and demonstrates the utility and significance of defining and registering terms to enable semantic, as well as syntactic, interoperability. The SWE framework provides an avenue for conveying quality flags and methods used to make assurances about the integrity of oceanographic data for real-time consumption and for potential submittal to permanent archives such as NODC."

Whilst the amount of digitised information is constantly increasing, so too is the pace of progress in information technology, resulting in obsolescence of the software and hardware required to access and view digital information. Despite many organisations recognising this threat and the resulting need for preservation action, more work is required to effectively address the issue. We present in this article a framework for the long-term digital preservation of 3-D data.

While several libraries have funded projects which acknowledge the need to digitize other forms of text, few have extended the digital projects to include film, much less performed texts. Further, as more performing arts incorporate born-digital elements, use digital tools to create media-rich performance experiences, and look to the possibility for digital preservation of the performance text, the capture of the performance event and its born-digital artefacts must be considered. This article, then, presents a first look at the ARTeFACT project, undertaken at the University of Virginia Library in collaboration with an introductory course in Engineering and a student choreographer at Brenau University Women's College.

Geospatial content in the public domain as well as that which is not is being accessioned into our collections. While public domain data may often be accessioned without having to seek explicit permission from the agency or group creating and/or hosting the materials, private data should be captured with a clear understanding of the rights and responsibilities of the stakeholders, be they the content owner or the university. In addition, the two collecting nodes (and any future nodes) must agree upon standards of conduct in order to trust that any content brought into the network will be managed well now and into the future. Joint agreements have been written by UCSB and Stanford that codify all of these relationships. This paper will lay out those agreements, which include the Content Provider Agreement, the NGDA Content Collection Node Agreement, and the NGDA Content Collection Node Procedure Manual. These three agreements provide the legal and structural framework of the NGDA allowing the stewardship network to grow over time with the understanding that each new partner will meet the standards necessary to provide secure long-term preservation of the content."

K. Skinner; M. Halbert,2009,The metaarchive cooperative: A collaborative approach to distributed digital preservation,"As identified by the U.S. Congress, there is a national need for collaborative approaches to digital preservation services for cultural, historical, and political repositories. Responding to this need, the Library of Congress established the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in 2003 to produce a national network of partners collaborating on digital preservation"" that would pioneer a variety of digital preservation services for cultural memory organizations. Among these collaborative ventures, the MetaArchive Initiative developed an organizational model and operated a technical infrastructure (building on the LOCKSS software developed at Stanford University) for preserving the digital assets of cultural memory organizations in a geographically distributed framework. Subsequently, MetaArchive transitioned from a project to a program with the founding of the MetaArchive Cooperative in 2007. This article focuses upon the relationship between MetaArchive and NDIIPP, highlighting MetaArchive's commitment to enable institutions to host their own preservation solutions rather than outsourcing this core mission. It details the strategies that the MetaArchive Cooperative has employed to support, sustain, and grow its cross-institutional collaboration; explores an array of logistical and organizational issues that have arisen; and discusses the strengths of particular organizational structures for fostering and sustaining collaborative work between peer institutions."""
L. Ding; A. Ball; M. Patel; J. Matthews; G. Mullineux,2009,Strategies for the collaborative use of CAD product models,"Today, more and more companies are shifting from design and manufacturing to provide through-life support. Product models, as one of the most important types of product information, must be communicated, shared, and retrieved between distributed design teams and various users or partners at different stages of a product lifecycle. However, the conventional CAD models cannot satisfy these demands due to the ephemeral nature of the CAD systems and issues of proprietary formats, the protection of intellectual property, and the recording of domain-specific information. To overcome some limitations of CAD models, lightweight representations have been developed during the last decade to support collaborative product development. This paper aims to address the issue of long-lived product models using a combination of CAD models and lightweight representations. A new strategy, which integrates the techniques of the annotation of product models and the registration and storage of representation information, is proposed to support product models and other related information to be shared and reused over the long-term product life. Three key issues in the proposed strategy have been addressed: storage of extra information by the 'stand-off annotation of product models; sharing information among CAD models and their derived lightweight representations through the consistent identification of geometry; and keeping product data readable and reusable in the future by long-term preservation of representation information. An implementation has proved that the proposed strategy can be applied using current software techniques."
L. E. Campbell,2009,Recollection: Integrating data through access,"This demonstration of the Recollection project of the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program at the Library of Congress will showcase a prototype platform, tools and environment for sharing and access to diverse born-digital collections. As the Program has addressed the development of distributed preservation through a national community of partner institutions, the challenge of access and interoperability has become more urgent. The network needs to be able to strategically bring collections under stewardship and keep an inventory without excessive burden on the collecting organizations. The data under stewardship is very diverse and follows standards acceptable within each content domain. These circumstances require an infrastructure that enables the community of NDIIPP Partners to share their collections and data on an ongoing basis. This allows NDIIPP to maintain the benefits of a distributed network of partners and also take advantage of the collections speaking to one another. © 2009 Springer."
L. Simes; B. Pymm,2009,Legal issues related to whole-of-domain web harvesting in Australia,"Selective archiving of Web sites in Australia has been under way since 1996. This approach has seen carefully selected sites preserved after site owners granted permission. The labor-intensive nature of this process means only a small number of sites can ever be acquired in this manner. An alternate approach is an automated whole-of-domain capture of sites, which has been undertaken in a number of countries, including Australia. This article considers the existing legal position in taking this approach and looks at how legal deposit and copyright legislation constrains the process. It also considers recent amendments to the Copyright Act to provide more flexibility along the lines of the U.S. fair-use approach and the possible impact these new provisions may have for those involved with large-scale Web archiving in Australia."

While there are generic approaches to long-term preservation, further research and development work is needed to address any specifics of the digital objects in the cultural heritage domain. In this paper, we will take two case studies of recent projects and analyse to what extent the metadata accompanying digital objects contribute to guarantee longevity. We summarize this analysis in two scenarios for sustainability of resources produced by small projects because compared to big institutions their digital assets are facing a higher risk not to be preserved properly. We also identify processes where natural language technologies could be of help to make the preservation more efficient. ©2009 Association for Computational Linguistics."

Specialized approaches, models and technologies are needed to guarantee the long-term understandability of the preserved data. Maintaining the authenticity (trustworthiness) and provenance (history of creation, ownership, accesses and changes) of the preserved objects for the long term is of great importance, since users must be confident that the objects in the changed environment are authentic. We present a novel model for managing authenticity in long term digital preservation systems and a supporting archival storage component. The model and archival storage build on OAIS, the leading standard in the area of long-term digital preservation. The preservation aware storage layer handles provenance data, and documents the relevant events. It collocates provenance data (and other metadata) together with the preserved data in a secure environment, thus enhancing the chances of their co-survival. Handling authenticity and provenance at the storage layer reduces both threats to authenticity and computation times. This work addresses core issues in long-term digital preservation in a novel and practical manner. We present an example of managing authenticity of data objects during data transformation at the storage component. © TaPP 2009.All right reserved."

M. Ghosh,2009,E-theses and Indian academia: A case study of nine ETD digital libraries and formulation of policies for a national service,"This paper examines the developments in ETD repositories, in particular PhD thesis repositories, in India. The purpose is to perform a preliminary study and explore the possibilities for creating a national repository for the deposit, discovery, use and long-term care of research theses in an open access environment. The author looks at the current state of deployment of ETD repositories in the academic sector and discusses the subject coverage, number of items, access policy, browse/search option, and value added services. This study raises questions about policies and strategies that national higher education, research funding and policy-making bodies, as well as individual institutional communities within the higher education sector will want to consider. In spite of the great interest in e-theses development and the fact that the majority of doctoral theses in India are being produced electronically, no wide scale activity has been initiated by the government in terms of the storage and dissemination of these materials. Adoption of national level policies on institutional repository development is also lacking in India. To date, very few institutes request students to electronically submit their theses and dissertations. This article proposes the construction of a reservoir of extensive doctoral research and an Indian portal to enable preserving of scientific and technological research materials in the country and a global view of Indian institutional research assets. A few national level institutes such as the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Institute of Technologies have established ETD repositories and a few are currently in the planning stage. The survey reveals that digital preservation of theses and dissertations is already in progress, though some of them are still in a preliminary stage. The major problems and concerns reported by respondents are summarized and findings are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

They are both an unqualified success, due to long-lived and sustainable archival organizations, and in need of further development because not all digital content is being preserved. This article is about the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data-PASS), a project supported by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP), which is a partnership of five major U.S. social science data archives. Broadly speaking, Data-PASS has the goal of ensuring that at-risk social science data are identified, acquired, and preserved, and that we have a future-oriented organization that could collaborate on those preservation tasks for the future. Throughout the life of the Data-PASS project we have worked to identify digital materials that have never been systematically archived, and to appraise and acquire them. As the project has progressed, however, it has increasingly turned its attention from identifying and acquiring legacy and at-risk social science data to identifying ongoing and future research projects that will produce data. This article is about the project's history, with an emphasis of the issues that underlay the transition from looking backward to looking forward."

Although some information is less/more costly to create or less/more relevant to our environment, some of it is defi nitely worth saving and may be of great value for next generations. Libraries (as well as similar institutions like archives) have the legal responsibility to safeguard long-term access to our scientific, social, and cultural heritage. The need for long-term preservation however is not necessarily limited to libraries and similar institutions, but is also relevant for governments, businesses, and even for individuals, e.g. in order to keep a photo album or important documents accessible for a longer period of time. Information artifacts can be both of analogue (e.g.: documents/photos/etc. on paper or microfilm) or digital (digital data stored on appropriate media) form with a clear increase of the latter and a decrease of the former. Over the last decades digitization of analogue assets started to play an increasingly important role over analogue preservation (paper, microfilm, etc.), among other reasons due to miniaturization and improved storage. Libraries have thus invested billions1 of Euros over the last decade(s) in the digitization of their assets. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

The framework describes in a formalized manner how to deal with annotations, overlapping multiple watermarks, and how to express semantic relationships between the annotations. Based on this, our watermarking algorithm is presented, extended by support of image hashing and cover pre-conditioning. Further, we present three application scenarios: annotations for technical manuals, digital long-term preservation and medical images. For these parameter recommendations are derived."

Other surveys convey that archivists are participating in the development and implementation of institutional repositories at a variety of levels and have contributed to the broadening of content and source materials that increasingly reside in institutional repositories. Archivists report that institutional repositories have generally benefited archives by providing a delivery mechanism for and enhancing access to institutional records and digital collections.

N. Hoebelheinrich; N. K. Munn,2009,Assessing the utility of current format registry efforts for geospatial formats,"Implicit within the metadata strategy of most archiving or preservation institutions is the use of format registries to contain important information, usually technical in nature, that is common among like formats or data types. At present, there are several approaches to data models, policies, and implementation models for format registries that are in various stages of implementation and/or conception including The National Archives ' (UK) PRONOM Technical Registry, the Global Digital Format Registry (GDFR), funded by the Mellon Foundation and led by Harvard University Library, and the Library of Congress (USA). The National Geospatial Digital Archive (NGDA) project funded by the Library of Congress ' National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) has been investigating whether existing or planned format registry efforts do or would support the often quite complex geospatial data formats which NGDA and other institutions are collecting for long term preservation. This paper discusses results of a comparative study of the data models of pertinent format registries in which instances of over 20 proprietary and open geospatial formats were examined to assess whether the elements within the data models could adequately describe a given format and its relatives, and if not, what other kinds of information would be important to include. The paper places the findings and recommendations info the context of previous work done by the NGDA team and others about what preservation metadata would be appropriate for geospatial resources. In addition, the paper discusses differences in definitions for key format registry concepts describing relationships among formats. Finally, we identify related research questions yet to be answered regarding the usability of existing and potential format registry efforts for geospatial resources, and the broader questions about the practicability of gathering this and other pertinent preservation metadata for geospatial resources."

Such productions in public television are at great risk of being lost, because practices for long-term preservation of digital video are just now emerging, and because there is no mandate for preservation within the public broadcasting system. NDIIPP funded Preserving Digital Public Television, a partnership between WNET-TV in New York, WGBH-TV in Boston, PBS and New York University, to build a model preservation repository for digital video files and to examine the broader issues related to operating such a repository. In addition to designing the repository itself, the project became a lead advocate for adopting technical and metadata standards across the television field. The project also successfully challenged the public television system to recognize that preservation is necessary to keep digital productions alive. This resulted in public broadcasting allocating money for the first time to launch an initiative with a goal of properly managing its collective archival holdings."

A critical problem in developing systems is the process of validating whether the delivered solution effectively reflects the validated requirements. This is a challenge also for the EU-funded SHAMAN project, which aims to develop an integrated preservation framework using grid-technologies for distributed networks of digital preservation systems, for managing the storage, access, presentation, and manipulation of digital objects over time. Recognising this, the project team ensured that alongside the user requirements an assessment framework was developed. This paper presents the assessment of the SHAMAN demonstrators for the memory institution, industrial design and engineering and eScience domains, from the point of view of user's needs and fitness for purpose. An innovative synergistic use of TRAC criteria, DRAMBORA risk registry and mitigation strategies, iRODS rules and information system models requirements has been designed, with the underlying goal to define associated policies, rules and state information, and make them wherever possible machine-encodable and enforceable. The described assessment framework can be valuable not only for the implementers of this project preservation framework, but for the wider digital preservation community, because it provides a holistic approach to assessing and validating the preservation of digital libraries, digital repositories and data centres.

This paper discusses some preliminary results from a questionnaire survey, conducted as part of the trial implementation of the Data Audit Framework Methodology at University College London (UCL). Fifty seven (57) academic and research staff from 5 designated departments and an interdisciplinary research centre provided information about the nature of their research and the types of primary research data they produce. The survey explored factors that could impact on access, use and preservation of such data. The preliminary results indicate that researchers recognise the potential usefulness of such data for other researchers as well as their long term value. Retaining primary research data after the end of the funding period and re-using them for initiating further research are practices already acknowledged. However, ownership, copyright and restrictions on access to research data can be hazy areas for academic and research staff and require further investigation, advice and support. The value of primary research data appears to be closely linked to the context within the data which were generated."

Leti Messina,2009,"Survey and 3D reconstruction of the St. orso capitals in aosta, through three-focal photogrammetry","This paper describes the methodology adopted and the results obtained during the 3D documentation of the medieval capitals of St. Orso Collegiate Church, in Aosta, for reference and digital archiving. This task has been carried out through low cost technology entirely based on digital scanning of high quality images applying stereophotogrammetric principles. This technology allows to obtain point clouds with RGB information and geometries at different levels of complexity, processing a number of images taken with a limited set of constraints, with the use of a special acquisition equipment and through an image matching algorithm. Issue in this research was to obtain the accurate 3D information required to build models of artifacts of a such heritage importance, with a high degree of complexity. In future the 3D model will contribute to create a spatial Information System which will assist conservation and restoration activities on the one hand and will be used for tourist information inside the St. Orso Collegiate Church on the other. © 2009 IEEE."
P. Stakelon,2009,A sound that never sounded: The historical construction of sound fidelity,"Cylinder recordings as an early form of reproducible sound media were first used in 1877 and continued to be produced commercially up until 1929 by Edison. The many cylinders that exist today in various states of decomposition have become objects of concern for those with an interest in historical sound recordings. With this concern leading to preservation efforts converting cylinder sounds into digital form, how should a cylinder sound and with the transformative potential for digital manipulation readily available, how should a digital file of a cylinder record sound? This article discusses the production process of both cylinder recordings and their digital conversions, revealing how fidelity never actually existed in the production process. The University of California Santa Barbara's Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project exemplifies a digital preservation project that reveals what is valued during the digital conversion process. By describing how the cylinders are imbued with meaning through the concerns of manufactures, archivists, internet users and collectors, this article proves that processes concerned with the objectification of sound are motivated by specific social and technological desires motivated by nostalgia for an imagined sound fidelity."
P. Williams; J. Leighton John; I. Rowland,2009,The personal curation of digital objects: A lifecycle approach,"Purpose- This paper aims to set out a coherent intellectual framework to help to better understand how people create, organise, manage, use and dispose of their personal digital archives. The context for this is the increasing volume and diversity of digital information objects being captured and stored by individuals in their personal capacities and the need to find ways to preserve this material for posterity.Design/methodology/approach- The research presented here is based on literature analysis, the questions having been informed by an earlier series of in-depth interviews. The approach taken is to synthesise key concepts from the computer science, information management, and archives and records management literatures. Key concepts from the existing literature in computer science, information management, and archives and records management were elicited and synthesised to create a coherent document lifecycle narrative.Findings- Individuals exhibit great diversity in terms of personal information management and digital archiving practice at just about every point in the digital information cycle: much more so than is the case in formal repositories. Practices exhibited are not always conducive to efficient document management. This represents a very keen challenge for professional curatorial practice.Practical implications- Little is known about how individuals manage digital information resources in their personal capacity, outside of their corporate or institutional employment. Yet both individuals on their own and professional curators on behalf of repositories are increasingly being faced with the challenge of how to deal with digital media. It is hoped that this paper will contribute to a growing debate in this area.Originality/value- Personal information management from the perspective of personal digital archives is a surprisingly under-researched area and the proposed model adopts an archival information lifecycle approach. It seeks to apply and promote an archivally-oriented personal information management. © 2009, "

R. E. Griffin,2009,Data Archiving: The Perspective of the IAU,"Historically, the archiving of photographic observations has been predominantly a service on behalf of the astronomical community, both local and worldwide. In parallel, efforts to ensure the long-term preservation of that material have mostly come through the community at large via its official body, the International Astronomical Union. While the role of the IAU is largely passive, it is vital in providing a framework in which its international Working Groups can share, manage and achieve decisions and co-operations at levels which would be difficult to reach by individual action. To serve the purposes for which they have been archived, historic data need to be kept ticking over in a healthy condition. The IAU provides an excellent forum for the activities which those needs entail."
R. Ferrante; L. S. Fuhrig,2009,Digital preservation: Using the email account XML schema,"The Smithsonian Institution Archives (SIA) and the Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) conducted a three-year pilot that explored preservation challenges with email collections. This paper reviews the acquisition model and workflow used based on the OAIS Reference Model. Rather than focusing on individual messages, the Collaborative Electronic Records Project (CERP) settled on preserving an account as a whole, maintaining the structure and relationships within a collection as well as simplifying metadata management. This paper also reviews some of the challenges with the email collections, including lack of organization and inclusion of non-record/sensitive material. Both archives also addressed the importance of sound recordkeeping practices and retention schedules and issued various guidarne documents for depositors. CERP also collaborated with another research team (the E-Mail Collaborative Initiative (EMCAP)) to develop an XML schema capable of encompassing a complete email account and its coment. The E-Mail Account XML schema defines a standard XML structure for preserving an email account along with its internal organization, its messages and attachments, and the interrelationships of the messages without sacrificing granular email message data. This paper describes the schema, its unique characteristics, and its value to the archival and digital preservation communities in the context of, and comparison to, other efforls to digitally preserve email. The schema structure positions preserved email accounts for multiple levels of searching strategies including: individual messages, account-wide, and cross-account search and retrieval. This helps to expose social networks and message interrelationships present in, and across, accounts. The E-Mail Account schema has made possible the preservation oflarge bodies of related e-mail in a single XML file, as demonstrated in the recent EMCAP and CERP projects. Unlike other work in the area of e-mail preservation, this XML schema is distinct in: 1) its account-based paradigm; 2) the granularity of data captured; 3) its alignment with the email message standard RFC 2822; 4) the support of a single XML file representation of the account; and 5) its incorporalion into two separately developed e-mail preservation software applications."

R. Schmidt; C. Sadilek; R. King,2009,A service for data-intensive computations on virtual clusters,"Digital Preservation deals with the long-term storage, access, and maintenance of digital data objects. In or-der to prevent a loss of information, digital libraries and archives are increasingly faced with the need to electron-ically preserve vast amounts of data while having limited computational resources in-house. However, due to the po-tentially immense data sets and computationally intensive tasks involved, preservation systems have become a recog-nized challenge for e-science. We argue that grid and cloud technology can provide the crucial technology for building scalable preservation systems. In this paper, we present recent developments on a Job Submission Service that is based on standard grid mechanisms and capable of provid-ing a large cluster of virtual machines. The service allows clients to specify and execute preservation tools on large data sets based on dynamically generated job descriptors. This approach allows us to utilize a cloud infrastructure that is based on platform virtualization as a scaling environment for the execution of preservation workflows. Finally, we present experimental results that have been conducted on the Amazon EC2 and S3 utility cloud infrastructure. © 2009 IEEE."

S. Baldissini; A. M. Manferdini; M. E. Masci,2009,"An information system for the integration, management and visualization of 3D reality based archaeological models from different operators","This paper describes a web-based information system designed with the aim to make available on a 3D GIS platform reality-based 3D models representing archaeological finds at an architectural scale. In wide and complex archaeological sites, different artifacts need to be modeled by different operators, using different methodologies and technologies, working in different places and times, so that the methods to build them need to be defined a-priori, widely shared and verified a-posteriori. This is the reason why it is necessary to work for the definition of widely shared standards and for a long-term preservation of 3D cultural heritage data related to archaeological sites. In order to meet these requirements, our application has been carried out using open source technologies and tools, widespread multi-platforms and standards. Entirely founded on the ICCD (Istituto Centrale per il Catalogo e la Documentazione) standards, our information system has been designed to guarantee interoperability and lead the cataloguer in data entry by simplifying and making the procedures more intuitive. Moreover, 3D modeling from real-world data is not a standardized procedure: survey and modeling methods strictly depend on the characteristics of the object, on the available technologies and on communicative aims. Our system is a purpose for solving the problem of the definition of the most appropriate methodology to adopt depending on the object and on the level of detail of its representation. The digital models of the finds are then linked to their related heterogeneous information using a semantic fragmentation and organization of elements and data."
S. Berger,2009,The evolving ethics of preservation: Redefining practices and responsibilities in the 21st century,"This article explores the ethics of preservation, both as they have been traditionally established and as they might apply to current and future digital preservation efforts. The first part of the article reviews the literature of the past two decades to see how the preservation community has defined the ethical dimensions of its work, as well as developed guidelines to support an ethical practice. The second part considers digital preservation and the ways it both extends and complicates established ethical tenets. Digital preservation challenges the library community to revisit fundamental preservation practices and responsibilities. Our ability to come to consensus on these issues will be critical for the public's continued trust in our roles as stewards of the cultural record."

Funded by the Digital Archive Project of National Science Council in Taiwan, the system was created five years ago and became outdated. It suffered problems such as overloading and unstableness. In order to preserve the valuable information that accumulated in the system so it can be accessed by users for a long period of time, the researchers adopted the technologies of refreshing, standardization, metadata, system migration, and system redundancy to upgrade the system. Then, we analyzed the website's log files to examine the effectiveness of the new system. Finally, the article suggests the National Science Council to establish a long-term digital information archive office as soon as possible, to plan the long-term preservation strategy, to train the technical staff, and to encourage team work between industry and academic units in order to provide the needed assistance for digital archive projects."

S. Green,2009,The digital library programme at the British Library: Goals and priorities,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to show how the British Library (BL) is responding to the changing world of publishing through the Digital Library Programme. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a descriptive review of the factors that led to the BL establishing the Digital Library Programme. The paper describes the goals of the programme, the priorities for the programme, the mechanisms for providing access to digital material acquired by the Library and gives an overview of the approach to ensuring that material stored in the Digital Library System remains permanently accessible. It also gives a brief overview of some of the main challenges that the Programme faces. Findings - The unique position of the BL within the research environment means that there is great benefit to be had in building a digital library to store significant amounts of material even where it is already available elsewhere. The reason for this is the ability of the Library to sustain storage and access over a much longer period than can be achieved by commercial companies. The Library has also built up significant expertise and a world leadership in the field of digital preservation. The use of a programme and project structure to manage the development of the infrastructure, processes and procedures has already shown that it can deliver significant benefit in the changing landscape of digital dissemination of information. The use of an iterative and incremental approach both for the programme as a whole and for projects within the programme has shown significant benefits in allowing the BL to make progress where the end goal is very ambitious and there is no obvious off-the-shelf solution. Practical implications - This may have broad applications for similar complex projects. Originality/value - The BL Digital Library Programme is providing a solution to the acquisition and dissemination of digital material on a larger scale than is common within the library and archiving community. © ."

S. Rhodes; D. Neacsu,2009,Preserving and ensuring long-term access to digitally born legal information,"Written laws, records and legal materials form the very foundation of a democratic society. Lawmakers, legal scholars and everyday citizens alike need, and are entitled, to access the current and historic materials that comprise, explain, define, critique and contextualize their laws and legal institutions. The preservation of legal information in all formats is imperative. Thus far, the twenty-first century has witnessed unprecedented mass-scale acceptance and adoption of digital culture, which has resulted in an explosion in digital information. However, digitally born materials, especially those that are published directly and independently to the Web, are presently at an extremely high risk of permanent loss. Our legal heritage is no exception to this phenomenon, and efforts must be put forth to ensure that our current body of digital legal information is not lost. The authors explored the role of the United States law library community in the preservation of digital legal information. Through an online survey of state and academic law library directors, it was determined that those represented in the sample recognize that digitally born legal materials are at high risk for loss, yet their own digital preservation projects have primarily focused upon the preservation of digitized print materials, rather than digitally born materials. Digital preservation activities among surveyed libraries have been largely limited by a lack of funding, staffing and expertise; however, these barriers could be overcome by collaboration with other institutions, as well as participation in a large-scale regional or national digital preservation movement, which would allow for resource-sharing among participants. One such collaborative digital preservation program, the Chesapeake Project, is profiled in the article and explored as a collaborative effort that may be expanded upon or replicated by other institutions and libraries tackling the challenges of digital preservation."

T. Erwin; J. Sweetkind-Singer; M. L. Larsgaard,2009,The National Geospatial Digital Archives-Collection Development: Lessons Learned,"There are many similarities between building a geospatial digital archive and building a hard-copy map collection, and two major ones are the necessity to have a collection development policy and the amount of hard work required to seek out and acquire the resources. Two institutions, University of California at Santa Barbara and Stanford University, the initial partners in the National Geospatial Digital Archives (NGDA), chose to collect digital data that was in line with each library's standard collection strengths and responsibilities. Collection development policies were written for the project as a whole and for each partner institution. While based on traditional paper map policies, these geospatial collection development policies are tailored specifically for digital data by including sections on metadata, versioning, file formats, proprietary formats, data set size, and ownership/access considerations.During the acquisition phase of the contract a considerable amount has been learned about file formats, data acquisition of compressed vs. uncompressed files, short-term storage prior to repository ingest, and metadata creation. While metadata creation at the collection-level/series-level has been relatively easy the acquisition phase has underscored the challenges inherent in creating accurate item-level metadata. One of the central findings of the NGDA experience is that format information is vital for long-term preservation. Thus, the need to understand file formats and specifications has led to the creation of a format registry specifically for geospatial materials."

Such information often needs to be preserved for a long-term and this is the responsibility of digital archiving systems. This paper proposes a reliable replication model of immutable digital content to be used in long-term archiving systems. The archiving system is modeled as a set of storage repositories where each repository has an independent fail probability assigned to it. Items are inserted with a reliability that is satisfied by replicating them in subsets of repositories. Through simulation, we evaluated three different proposed strategies to create replicas. It is also proposed a completely distributed archiving system using this model over a structured peerto-peer (P2P) network. The communication between the nodes (repositories) of the network is organized in a distributed hash table and multiple hash functions are used to select repositories that will keep the replicas of each stored item. The system is evaluated through experiments in a real environment. The proposed model and the algorithms, combined with the structured P2P scalability made possible the construction of a reliable and totally distributed digital archiving system. ©2009 IEEE."

Eleven NDIIPP partners were invited to participate. Interviews gathered qualitative information about a variety of economic sustainability issues, including developing business cases, implementing business models, measuring costs, and developing a stable economic basis for digital preservation programs. Survey results revealed a mix of consensus and division on various issues and shed interesting light upon the sustainability of preservation programs generally. The article provides an overview of the survey and its methodology, categorizes the responses, and draws some high-level conclusions. While the survey results should be viewed within the context of NDIIPP, they may be useful for archives, libraries, and other preservation institutions as they consider economic sustainability issues."

X. Jin; J. Jiang; G. Min,2009,Towards computerized digital preservation based on intelligent agents and web services,"The explosively growing volume of digital information results in pressing demands to transfer digital objects from active IT systems to digital repositories, libraries, and archives for long-term preservation. However, existing strategies of digital preservation are labour intensive and often require specialist skills. In order to meet the preservation demands of immense digital information, it is necessary to find new levels of automation and self-reliance in preservation strategies. On the other hand, intelligent agent technology is widely viewed as a promising approach to developing large-scale complex software systems. It has already been successfully applied in some industrial and commercial areas. Meanwhile, Web services have evolved into a key paradigm for distributed computing. They provide an efficient way to realize loosely-coupled architecture and interoperable solutions across heterogeneous platforms and systems. Therefore, Web services have received great attention from both industry and a ademia. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no initiatives that employ the technologies of intelligent agents and Web services as the general methodology to study long-term digital preservation in the open literature. In this paper, we describe an intelligent agent and Web service based architecture of the PROTAGE system, which is funded by the European FP7 Research Programme and aims to computerize long-term digital preservation. We discuss the fundamental agents involved in the PROTAGE system as well as their interactions. We further present a general framework of automated decision making based on intelligent agents and Web services, which are crucial for the automation of long-term digital preservation.

With the transformation of the society, however, Song-jiang Baule Array is now facing problems conceming its preservation, distribution, and its distance with people 's lives in the rapid modem society. This project, therefore, aims to preserve and spread Song-jiang Battle Array with digitized coment development through the collaboration between Go-ping Community Association (the archive sector) and National Taiwan University ofArts (the academic sector). This project aims to construct a ""Digital Culture & Art Village of Song-jiang Battle Array"" through six goals of digital coment development-digital preservation, public demonstration, culture education, academic research, cultural inheritance, and value-added application planning. Through the six goals of digital coment developments with the collaboration between the academic sector and the archive sector, it is expected that the project would not only preserve and spread the cultural heritage ""Song-jiang Battle Array,"" but also remove the barrier between traditional culture and modem life. Furthermore, it would create new commercial values for traditional culture, and a new business model would be created with the combination between digital archive and cultural creative designing industry."""
Y. Marketakis; Y. Tzitzikas,2009,Dependency management for digital preservation using semantic web technologies,"The preservation of digital objects is a topic of prominent importance for archives and digital libraries. In this article, we focus on the problem of preserving the intelligibility of digital objects. We formalize the problem in terms of dependencies and specify a number of basic intelligibility-related tasks. In parallel, we introduce a preservation scenario as a means for clarifying the pros and cons of various representation and modeling languages that are used for the problem at hand, which reveals the benefits of adopting Semantic Web (SW) languages as a representation framework. To this end, we propose a minimal core ontology for representing intelligibility-related dependencies along with methodological hints for extending it. Finally, we report empirical and experimental results from applying the proposed approach on real data sets. It is worth mentioning that this approach can be used not only on SW-based repositories or archives, but also on those that are based on conventional approaches and languages (like EAST, DEDSL, XFDU/SAFE). © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
Y. Tonta,2009,Preservation of scientific and cultural heritage in Balkan countries,"Purpose: The peoples living in the Balkan Peninsula over centuries have created a very rich cultural heritage and the constant political upheavals in the region have affected the development and preservation of their cultures. This paper aims to review the internet infrastructure and networked readiness levels of the Balkan countries, which are conducive to scientific co-operation and preservation of digitised cultural heritage. It also explores the destructive effects of wars on the cultural riches of the region. Design/methodology/approach: The internet facilities and the scientific production of the Balkan countries were identified using published sources and Thomson's Web of Science database. A game-theoretic approach was used to expound the consequences of wars and the adverse effects of the nation-building process on cultural heritage artefacts. Findings: Balkan countries lack sound internet infrastructures, hindering their contributions to the world of science and stifling scientific co-operation among themselves in terms of joint papers. The co-ordinated efforts have yet to exist to streamline the digital preservation of the unique cultural heritage of the Balkan countries. Originality/value: This paper discusses the impact of the nation-building process on cultural and scientific heritage artefacts using the concepts of the game theory"". It reinforces the fact that destroying the cultural heritage artefacts during wars is not a ""zero-sum game"" in which the dominant culture wins and the ""other"" culture loses. It is not even a ""lose-lose game"" in which both parties lose. Rather, humanity loses part of its whole cultural heritage forever. © ."""
Y. Tzitzikas,2009,On providing intelligibility-aware preservation services for digital objects,"Preserving digital objects requires preservation of not only their bit-level representation but also their intelligibility. To this end a digital object should be associated with metadata appropriate for interpreting that object; such metadata are often referred as representation information. Even such metadata may not be intelligible, however, so we may have to associate them with extra metadata, and so on. This paper approaches this problem by introducing an abstract model comprising modules and dependencies. Community knowledge is formalized over the same model by introducing the notion of profile. This notion is then exploited for deciding representation information adequacy (during input) and intelligibility (during output). Subsequently some general dependency management services for identifying and filling intelligibility gaps during input and output are described and analysed. Finally a prototype system based on these ideas is described."

Trinity embodies and reflects the social and cultural changes that have taken place around it. Since its de-consecration in 1976, Trinity has passed through the hands of a number of groups and owners, whilst developing into a major music and community arts venue for the city. One aim of the project is to establish an online archive for Trinity. A digital archive can offer a more accessible means of engaging communities than a traditional physical archive. Moreover, it creates links between different items, eras, ideas and cultures, challenging physical, temporal and cultural divides. By adopting open standards in the development of the archive, it is hoped that we will allow wider inter-operability and re-use of content, as well as allowing replication of the infrastructure by other groups. This paper discusses some of the challenges encountered in building this archive."

Study participants' decisions and actions related to the preservation of their digital information were examined. Significant positive and negatives experiences using digital information were found to influence participants' behaviors. Motivated by frustration and anger over digital devices malfunctioning, participants intentionally store personal digital content in multiple locations as a means of digital preservation. Positive experiences with digital information motivated participants to unintentionally store and preserve personal content on the web as a result of social interactions through email and social networking sites. The findings provide support for the study of positive affective issues in information behavior research and in particular its relationship to information valued for the long term and social networks and web-based storage practices."
A. Green,2010,"BIG DIGITISATION: ORIGINS, PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS","The digitisation of print publications began on a small scale. In 2005 it entered a new phase, mass digitisation, with the beginning of Google’s Books programme. This aimed to convert whole collections and libraries into electronic form. A US challenge to Google’s digitisation plans in 2005 led to a complex legal dispute, between the company and authors, publishers and others, which remains unresolved. The advantages of the revised ‘Google Books Settlement’ (November 2009) are described, as well as the serious objections to it: these include uncertainties about ownership and use of the digitised texts and their long-term preservation, the quality of digitisation, monopoly of mass digitisation activity, and the fact that Google is not a permanent trusted institution. Alternatives to Google are analysed from the point of view of libraries and others wishing to digitise collections: these include public sponsorship and private partnerships. Future uses of the product of mass digitisation are hard to predict. Among them may be novel ways of analysing large corpora of unstructured text, and substantial interaction with contributor-users. © Edinburgh University Press."

During the initial stages of the project, a detailed user requirements analysis led by HATII at the University of Glasgow was conducted across three domains: memory institutions, industrial design and engineering, and e-science. This research pinpointed the needs and expectations that end-users and service providers feel should be met by such a preservation framework. This paper gives an overview of the requirements that were gathered, formulated and adopted by this project. It then discusses the outcomes of this empirical research and indicates both how these outcomes are being implemented within SHAMAN and how external parties may also benefit from the findings. Approaches to digital preservation are often still ad hoc and based on a single institution focus. They frequently do not take into consideration the needs of the variety of actors who will come into contact with a system throughout the preservation lifecycle. This paper provides an insight into the preservation practices that a broad range of real-world organisations would like to follow and provides a discussion of how SHAMAN intends to meet the needs of the identified users."

In this paradigm, there may not be a common versioning structure from one production episode to anotherThis paper then develops a mathematical framework for three provenance tracing activities that are important in long-term preservation of Earth science data:tracing the history of data production that created an item of Earth science data, with particular attention to the versioning structure of the data collectionstracing the history of custody for an itemtracing the history of Intellectual Property Rights transfers for an itemEach of these activities has its own type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) underlying a particular kind of provenance.

C. Becker; A. Rauber,2010,Improving component selection and monitoring with controlled experimentation and automated measurements,"Context: A number of approaches have been proposed for the general problem of software component evaluation and selection. Most approaches come from the field of Component-Based Software Development (CBSD), tackle the problem of Commercial-off-the-shelf component selection and use goal-oriented requirements modelling and multi-criteria decision making techniques. Evaluation of the suitability of components is carried out largely manually and partly relies on subjective judgement. However, in dynamic, distributed environments with high demands for transparent selection processes leading to trustworthy, auditable decisions, subjective judgements and vendor claims are not considered sufficient. Furthermore, continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of components after integration is sometimes needed. Objective: This paper describes how an evidence-based approach to component evaluation can improve repeatability and reproducibility of component selection under the following conditions: (1) Functional homogeneity of candidate components and (2) High number of components and selection problem instances. Method: Our evaluation and selection method and tool empirically evaluate candidate components in controlled experiments by applying automated measurements. By analysing the differences to system-development-oriented scenarios, the paper shows how the process of utility analysis can be tailored to fit the problem space, and describes a method geared towards automated evaluation in an empirical setting. We describe tool support and a framework for automated measurements. We further present a taxonomy of decision criteria for the described scenario and discuss the data collection means needed for each category of criteria. Results: To evaluate our approach, we discuss a series of case studies in the area of digital preservation. We analyse the criteria defined in these case studies, classify them according to the taxonomy, and discuss the quantitative coverage of automated measurements. Conclusion: The results of the analysis show that an automated measurement, evaluation and selection framework is necessary and feasible to ensure trusted and repeatable decisions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We attack the classic Erdos - Renyi random, Barab́asi and Albert power law, Watts - Strogatz small world and our Unsupervised Small World (USW) graphs using different attacker strategies and report their respective robustness. Using different attacker profiles, we construct a game where the attacker is allowed to use a strategy of his choice to remove a percentage of each graph's elements. The graph is then allowed to repair some portion of its self. We report on the number of alternating attack and repair turns until either the graph is disconnected, or the game exceeds the number of permitted turns. Based on our analysis, an attack strategy that focuses on removing the vertices with the highest betweenness value is most advantageous to the attacker. Power law graphs can become disconnected with the removal of a single edge; random graphs with the removal of as few as 1% of their vertices, small-world graphs with the removal of 14% vertices, and USW with the removal of 17% vertices. Watts - Strogatz small-world graphs are more robust and resilient than random or power law graphs. USW graphs are more robust and resilient than small world graphs. A graph of USW connected WOs filled with data could outlive the individuals and institutions that created the data in an environment where WOs are lost due to random failures or directed attacks.

Among all the risks of digital preservation, format obsolescence is one of the most important. There have been several projects or initiatives dealing with the measurement method of format obsolescence risk, but there has been no mechanism to quantify the preservation risk or durability of digital formats based on a self-improving assessment model, executed with the aid of computers. This paper deals with a methodology for measuring the preservation durability of digital formats, especially for their risk assessment. This method is based on a quantitative assessment model for format risk, and can shift the non-quantifiable knowledge or experiences of field experts to a machine identifiable and processible form, or 'risk scores'. Results can be recognized and communicated by computers automatically and formally, which can assist in the automatic/semi-automatic risk management for digital preservation, sharing this quantified knowledge among communities. Because technologies are changing quickly, the quantitative assessment model for risks will not be a status quo situation. Thus, also presented is a method to fine tune the quantitative assessment model for risk of formats through a self-learning and self-improving style. © 2010 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

C. Schlieder,2010,Digital heritage: Semantic challenges of long-term preservation,"The major digital preservation initiatives are about as old as the idea of the Semantic Web but the research areas only had little effect upon each other. This article identifies connections between the two research agendas. Three types of ageing processes are distinguished which affect digital records: media ageing, semantic ageing, and cultural ageing. It is argued that a period of 100 years constitutes an appropriate temporal frame of reference for addressing the problem of semantic ageing. Ongoing format migration constitutes currently the best option for temporal scaling at the semantic level. It can be formulated as an ontology matching problem. Research issues arising from this perspective are formulated that relate to the identification of long-term change patterns of ontologies and the long-term monitoring of ontology usage. Finally, challenges of cultural ageing are discussed. © 2010 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved."

D. Anderson; J. Delve; D. Pinchbeck,2010,Toward a workable emulation-based preservation strategy: Rationale and technical metadata,"The KEEP project is the first of its kind to seriously research the kind of emulation based on a virtual machine as put forward by Lorie (2002). In addition to creating such a virtual machine, a number of other supporting tools and techniques are also being developed as part of this EC FP7 project. One of these is an emulation metadata data model with a dual purpose: first, for use as the basis of a database that forms part of the Emulation Framework that will run on the KEEP Virtual Machine (KVM); and, second, for use as the core of an emulation metadata standard, envisaged to be taken up by the wider community. This paper is thus very much geared toward a practical discussion of emulation. However, before the digital preservation community will consider emulation as a viable option compared to migration; it is imperative that the polarized positions exemplified by Rothenberg and Bearman are carefully analyzed, deconstructed, and, where necessary, set aside. In this way, some options that have previously been dismissed out of hand can be allowed to resurface, and their relative merits be reconsidered. The second part of the article comprises a detailed investigation of the technical environment necessary to emulate a given digital object. The technical environment data, thus obtained, is then used to create the core of the emulation metadata model. The article concludes with a consideration of video games' metadata, as games represent the most complex digital objects planned to be emulated as part of the KEEP project. 2010 11 25.

D. Bienz; R. Gschwind; M. F. Pozza; L. Gantner,2010,Mass CD/DVD migration: A novartis case study,"Nowadays computers are an essential part of modern pharmaceutical research and data storage. It is also well known that experimental and observational data is crucial for scientific research. For approximately twelve years now, the pharmaceutical industry is storing its research data on portable storage media, where each research group was obligated to archive their research data on such portable media but they had also much individual responsibility for the archiving process. So far there are over 3,000 portable media in the raw data archives of Novartis. Digital data archives are more unstable than paper-based archives basically due to development of computer technology and rapid changes of digital storage media. To guarantee the future readability and to preserve the research data, Novartis has decided to migrate the data from the current portable storage media to a storage type more suitable for long-term preservation while preserving the authenticity and provenance. In this paper, we would like to report on this migration project that nicely illustrates several problems of digital archiving and provides state-of-the-art solutions for them."
D. G. Alemneh; S. K. Hastings,2010,Exploration of adoption of preservation metadata in cultural heritage institutions: Case of PREMIS,"The challenges of long-term access issues are multifaceted, often requires a mixture of approaches. Considering the critical role of metadata in any successful digital preservation strategy, the Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) has been extremely influential on providing a core"" set of metadata elements that support the digital preservation process. However, there is no evidence, in the form of previous research, as to what factors explain and predict the level of adoption of PREMIS. This paper attempts to identify factors that affect the adoption of PREMIS in cultural heritage institutions. The study employed a web-based survey to collect data from 123 participants in 20 country as well as a semi-structured, follow-up telephone interview with a smaller sample of the survey respondents. Roger's diffusion of innovation theory was used as a theoretical framework. The main constructs considered for the study were relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability, and institution readiness. The analysis showed that all six factors influence the adoption of PREMIS in varying degrees. Results of a regression analysis also showed a statistically significant relationship. The R square value for the model was .528, which means that 52.8% of the variance in PREMIS adoption was explained by a combination of the six factors. This research just barely begins to show the many layers of the complex problem of digital preservation. This study has important implications for future research on preservation metadata and provides recommendations for researchers and stakeholders engaged in digital preservation and metadata standards development efforts."""

D. Giaretta,2010,"Digital preservation challenges, infrastructures and evaluations","To preserve digitally encoded information over a long term following the OAIS Reference Model requires that the information remains accessible, understandable and usable by a specified Designated Community. These are significant challenges for repositories. It will be argued that infrastructure which is needed to support this preservation must be seen in the context of the broader science data infrastructure which international and national funders seek to put in place. Moreover aspects of the preservation components of this infrastructure must themselves be preservable, resulting in a recursive system which must also be highly adaptable, loosely coupled and asynchronous. Even more difficult is to be able to judge whether any proposal is actually likely to be effective. From the earliest discussions of concerns about the preserv-ability of digital objects there have been calls for some way of judging the quality of digital repositories. In this chapter several interrelated efforts which contribute to solutions for these issues will be outlined. Evidence about the challenges which must be overcome and the consistency of demands across nations, disciplines and organisations will be presented, based on extensive surveys which have been carried out by the PARSE.Insight project (http://www.parse-insight.eu). The key points about the revision of the OAIS Reference Model which is underway will be provided; OAIS provides many of the key concepts which underpin the efforts to judge solutions. In the past few years the Trustworthy Repositories Audit and Certification: Criteria and Checklist (TRAC) document has been produced, as well as a number of related checklists. These efforts provide the background of the international effort (the RAC Working Group http://wiki.digitalrepositoryauditandcertification.org) to produce a full ISO standard on which an accreditation and certification process can be built. If successful this standard and associated processes will allow funders to have an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the archives they support and data producers to have a basis for deciding which repository to entrust with their valuable data. It could shape the digital preservation market. The CASPAR project (http://www.casparpreserves.eu) is an EU part funded project with total spend of 16MEuros which is trying to faithfully implement almost all aspects of the OAIS Reference Model in particular the Information Model. The latter involves tools for capturing all types of Representation Information (Structure, Semantics and all Other types), and tools for defining the Designated Community. This chapter will describe implementations of tools and infrastructure components to support repositories in their task of long term preservation of digital resources, including the capture and preservation of digital rights management and evidence of authenticity associated with digital objects. In order to justify their existence, most repositories must also support contemporaneous use of contemporary as well as historical"" resources; the authors will show how the same techniques can support both, and hence link to the fuller science data infrastructure. © 2010, IGI Global."""
D. Gourley; P. B. Viterbo,2010,A Sustainable repository infrastructure for digital humanities: The DHO experience,"The Digital Humanities Observatory was created to support the long-term management of electronic cultural heritage resources for the digital humanities in Ireland. However, the project grant was for three years and the economic downturn has diminished opportunities for continued funding. The challenge is to demonstrate the importance and value of maintaining these e-resources, and to make it feasible for the resource owners to do so without the DHO if necessary. ICT systems can support cost effective and value-adding access and management of resources in a way that might be sustained in the short-term by organizations and projects that lack the funding, staffing, and skills to build and operate a digital preservation environment. In this project paper we describe how the DHO uses technology to promote the value of preservation and interoperability of e-resources, and to provide a means for achieving these goals in the face of significant sustainability risks. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
D. I. Schwartz; J. D. Bayliss,2010,The ethics of reverse engineering for game technology,"This chapter demonstrates how legal concepts, accepted practices, and research in reverse engineering (a process of disassembling a system to understand how it works) can provide ethical and legal outlets for end-users. The game industry has influenced reverse engineering law and practice, challenging ethical practices in industry, academia, and with end-users. Although these communities supposedly rely on legal precedents, actual laws are often misunderstood, ignored, or just unknown. The communities continually struggle to balance the protection of intellectual property with consumer freedom, and reverse engineering demonstrates this conflict. We demonstrate how a variety of communities embrace reverse engineering through a series of case studies involving current commercial games and technology. The case studies include the modding community, massively-multiplayer online game community tools, digital preservation, and reverse engineering education. Although a clear ruling on legality eludes the field, we conclude with suggestions on dealing with ethical and legal aspects surrounding this issue. © 2011, IGI Global."
D. R. Donaldson; P. Conway,2010,Implementing PREMIS: a case study of the Florida Digital Archive,"Purpose The purpose of this case study is to describe and interpret the PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) implementation process, to gain more insight into why barriers to the adoption of PREMIS exist as well as how to overcome them. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative case study analysis highlights the Florida Digital Archive as an exemplar of an organization in the throes of deciding just how to implement the PREMIS metadata model in a working repository system. Findings Findings from this study suggest that use of PREMIS requires adaptation in which an organization must make changes in order to use PREMIS, and vice versa. Findings also suggest that there are clearly defined steps involved in the PREMIS implementation process, and that the nature of this process is iterative. Research limitations/implications This study is limited by a short data collection period. It is also limited by investigating only one institution during its implementation process. Future studies could test the validity of the model proposed in this study and include multiple institutions. Practical implications By providing context for the implementation process, this paper can help cultural heritage institutions interested in fully adopting PREMIS. Originality/value Exploring PREMIS implementation using DOI/MIS literature is novel in the digital preservation community and is proposed as particularly useful to digital preservationists who are considering adopting PREMIS. The paper suggests that seemingly innocuous decisions by developers have real implications for preservation. © 2010, . All rights reserved."
D. S. H. Rosenthal,2010,Format obsolescence: Assessing the threat and the defenses,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the approach to format obsolescence, preparing for format migration, that has guided most digital preservation work for the last 15 years. It asks why this approach has not rescued significant content in that time, and whether it would succeed in rescuing future content at risk of format obsolescence. Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines the mechanisms of format obsolescence, its historical and current incidence, and identifies attributes of at-risk formats. It examines each step of the current approach asking how effective it would be for these formats. Findings: The current approach assumes format obsolescence is common, happening frequently to most formats. In fact it is rare, happening infrequently to rare formats. The current approach, based on this mis-diagnosis, is ineffective. An alternate approach, based on open source and virtualization, is cheaper and more effective. Originality/value: The paper makes the case that the commonly accepted approach to digital preservation devotes resources to activities that are unlikely to be effective. © ."

The aim of this paper has been to further elaborate the challenges lon-gterm preservation impose on recordkeeping strategies and when the record quality criteria of evidentiality, integrity, authenticity of records is to be fulfilled. The research has been carried out as a qualitative case study in a large railway infrastructure construction project, where many records are operational for more than 100 years. In this research we can conclude that the long-term preservation issue is difficult to take into consideration if proactive strategies are not adopted. It is also important not to separate the current recordkeeping strategy from long-term recordkeeping strategy."""
E. Hinrichs; V. Henrich; T.

In order to ensure long-term availability of the archived data, it is imperative that the data to be stored is conformant with standardized data formats and best practices followed by the relevant research communities. Storing, managing, and accessing such standard-conformant data requires a repository-based infrastructure. Two projects at the University of Tübingen are realizing a collaborative eScience research environment with the help of eSciDoc for the university that supports long-term preservation of all kinds of data as well as a fine-grained and contextualized data management: the INF project and the BW-eSci(T) project.

The aim of the paper is to demonstrate the role that information behaviour research may play in information system design. Theory. The paper explores the value of use cases in defining information requirements and considers their wider application in information behaviour research. Method. An analysis of the literature on long-term digital preservation systems (and, to a degree, digital libraries) is used as well as analysis of interviews undertaken in the course of the SHAMAN project. These interviews fall into the category of contextual inquiry as an explicit step for understanding who the customers really are and how they work on a day-to-day basis. Results. Four broad categories of needs in long term preservation are identified in literature: society at large, which has requirements for long-term preservation; organizational requirements; organizational staff who must operate the preservation system, undertaking the functions of ingest, access and delivery to end-users; end-users who need to draw upon the digital resource to help them with their work, study or research. The Universal Modelling Language with stereotypical actors and use cases offers information behaviour researchers a way to engage with system developers in a creative synergy."

Picariello,2010,Information extraction from multimedia documents for e-government applications,"Despite the exponential growth of information systems for supporting public administration requirements, we are still far from a complete automatic e-government system. In particular, there exists the need of automatic or semiautomatic procedures for the whole flow of digital documents management, in particular regarding: (1) automatic information extraction from digital documents; (2) semantic interpretation (3) storing; (4) long term preservation and (5) retrieval of the extracted information. In addition, in the last few years the textual information has been enriched with multimedia data, having heterogeneous formats and semantics. In this framework, it's the author's opinion that an effective E-Government information system should provide tools and techniques for multimedia information, in order to manage both the multimedia content of a bureaucratic document and the presentation constraints that are usually associated to such document management systems. In this paper, we will describe a novel system that exploits both textual and image processing techniques, in order to automatically infer knowledge from multimedia data, thus simplifying the indexing and retrieval tasks. A prototypal version of the system has been developed and some preliminary experimental results have been carried out, demonstrating the efficacy in real application contexts. © Springer Physica-Verlag 2010."
F. C. Chang; H. C. Huang,2010,Electrical network frequency as a tool for audio concealment process,"We live in a digital era. Digital contents may be produced by digital equipments or by converting old analog recordings. With the rapid growth of digital contents, digital archiving technology is demanded. Different types of contents require different processing techniques. In this paper, we focus on digital audio contents. The related techniques, such as forensics, authentication, and error concealment, were studied. When converting audio tapes to digital files, sometimes a certain automatic error detection and concealment is needed. However, traditional audio tapes were recorded without any error recovery information. Based on the restriction, we proposed a scheme that incorporates the electrical network frequency (ENF) as a tool for detecting damaged audio segments. The goal is to help people identifying candidate concealment segments. When using in an archiving application, it reduces the manpower as well as increases the accuracy of the generated meta-data. © 2010 IEEE."

F. Helt,2010,Quality Metrics in long-term preservation and restoration paradigms,"Increasing term of preservation for audio-visual digitized content as well as digital restoration requires a change in the measure of content quality. As soon as digital content is to be preserved for a long time it will become the only quality reference material. This is especially true because the traditional analog display technology will no longer be in use. As a consequence, monitoring the quality of content, estimating quality gain or loss after a restoration work and evaluating the expected quality for a given (possibly currently unknown) target display requires a new approach to quality evaluation. Most audio-visual quality measurement experiments used to be done by comparing an original version and a present version. However new technical paradigms imply a possible loss of reference to the original content hence the need for reference free quality measure. It is equally necessary to go beyond the traditional signal processing measures inherited from the video technology. All the technical processes applied to the analog content up to its digitization bring their own degradation and are modifying the quality of the content. A two stage strategy is proposed. A first set of metrics is derived from traditional signal and image processing and weighted considering the technical work-flow used to obtain the digital copy. Then a second metrics is built from the first one taking into account the intended restitution channel. Such a method is designed to allow a better estimation of quality when comparing two versions of the same preserved content or the gain of quality of a restored content."
F. Luan; M. Nygård; T. Mestl,2010,A mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing migration time,"File format obsolescence has so far been considered the major risk in long-term storage of digital objects. There are, however, growing indications that file transfer may be a real threat as the migration time, i.e., the time required to migrate Petabytes of data, may easily spend years. However, hardware support is usually limited to 3-4 years and a situation can emerge when a new migration has to be started although the previous one is still not finished yet. This paper chooses a process modeling approach to obtain estimates of upper and lower bounds for the required migration time. The advantage is that information about potential bottlenecks can be acquired. Our theoretical considerations are validated by migration tests at the National Library of Norway (NB) as well as at our department. © 2010 ACM."
F. Luan; T. Mestl; M. Nygård,2010,Quality requirements of migration metadata in long-term digital preservation systems,"Migration is the most common preservation strategy in long-term digital preservation systems. It relays old digital objects from one technique to another. A prerequisite for a successful migration is the availability of migration metadata, which provide enough background information to preserved digital objects. Without the migration metadata, the migration may not be possible, but also the digital object's consistency may be violated. It is therefore recognized that the migration metadata are essential but surprisingly no requirements on these migration metadata seem to be available. In this paper, quality requirements of such migration metadata are derived from common preservation metadata schemas. The completeness and the usefulness of these quality requirements are validated by a case study. The final results show that the quality requirements can actually improve the workflow of a migration procedure. In addition, they can be used to improve metadata schemas and thereby decrease the risks in future migrations. Finally, six improvement suggestions for preservation systems are derived from our analysis of the quality requirements. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Reference to a specific case study, St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin, describes the design and implementation of a methodology designed to allow for context and era-specific assessment. The research design is interdisciplinary, bridging theory and practice. The methodology is firmly based on the use of digital technologies, which allow for efficient, accurate and replicable procedure. Data capture, analysis and mapping of the architectural site was supplemented by reference to primary archived material. Digital preservation of primary material was an integral part of the project; the resulting record created a more complete digital repository of the cathedral, combining the information which can be read in the structure itself with documents relating to its history.

The purpose is to have in place techniques that, when in the presence of verified failures or potential risks, automatically apply specific business rules considering the perceived state of the system. This means that federations of data grids, as preservation systems, must be able to react to threats in order to keep the main properties of the system aligned with its business objectives. Ideally, those reactions should result in a self-organization of the system, especially when the changes occur between some limits. When out of those limits, the reactions should be effective at least to request human intervention."

G. Yeo,2010,'Nothing is the same as something else': Significant properties and notions of identity and originality,"What does it mean to claim that one record, one archival object, is identical to another? Questions of identity (or 'sameness') often arise in the fields of digital preservation, imaging, transcription and editing. Experts in these fields sometimes assert that success in their mission depends on the ability to define the 'significant' or 'essential' properties of records and that, if these can be protected, the identity of records will be preserved across episodes of migration or conversion. However, the determination of 'significant properties' is no less problematical than the debate about notions of 'value' in appraisal theory, not least because different user communities will bring different perceptions of what constitutes significance. The sameness of discrete entities, the concept of significance and the methods by which sameness or significance might be assessed are all open to dispute; opinions will inevitably depend on the contexts in which judgements are made. Originality is also a frequently contested notion, especially in the digital world, but must not be dismissed as meaningless. The copies that emerge from acts of migration, conversion or transcription are neither incontrovertibly identical to their originals nor carriers of properties that are objectively significant. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
H.

In that comprehensive report, which is aimed at a US public broadcasting audience, we present the technical, operational, and economic requirements for digital preservation to a large, diverse, and fragmented system that is generally unaccustomed to including preservation in its mandate. The report is largely framed around the guidelines established by the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) and Trustworthy Repositories Audit and Certification: Criteria and Checklist (TRAC), and argues that there is an urgent need for a dedicated digital preservation repository, or system of repositories. It discusses some economic and business models that such a repository might employ in order to sustain its operations. The report also presents a case study of the costs related to the development of the prototype preservation repository developed at New York University for the PDPTV Project. In this paper, we present some of the key findings of that report, and argue that sustainable preservation of public broadcasting requires the continual presence of six key factors: alignment of stakeholders, the integration of archival-friendly practices in the digital production workflow, following OAIS and TRAC guidelines, clear communication of value, the application of appropriate business models, and an ongoing re-evaluation of preservation needs and users expectations."
H. Brocks; A. Kranstedt; G. Jäschke; M. Hemmje,2010,Modeling context for digital preservation,"Digital preservation can be regarded as ensuring communication with the future, that means ensuring the persistence of digital resources, rendering them findable, accessible and understandable for supporting contemporary reuse as well as safeguarding the interests of future generations. The context of a digital object to be preserved over time comprises the representation of all known properties associated with it and of all operations that have been carried out on it. This implies the information needed to decode the data stream and to restore the original content, information about its creation environment, including the actors and resources involved, and information about the organizational and technical processes associated with the production, preservation, access and reuse of the digital object. In this article we propose a generic context model which provides a formal representation for capturing all these aspects, to enable retracing information paths for future reuse. Building on experiences with the preservation of digital documents in so-called memory institutions, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach within the domain of scientific publishing. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The rise of digital collections and services has served as an impetus for much of this thinking along with a search for economic efficiencies and enhanced and integrated user access to materials. With the growing interest in, and actuality of, LAM convergence, there is a pressing need for educators of LAM professionals to consider how this new reality changes educational requirements and programs. This paper discusses digital curation as a promising area of convergence in both professional practice and professional education and provides a model that seeks to identify both common requirements and institutional differences. We have developed a Matrix of Digital Curation Knowledge and Competencies for identifying and organizing the material to be covered in a digital curation curriculum. The Matrix is organized along six dimensions: mandates, values and principles; functions and skills; professional, disciplinary or institutional / organizational context; type of resource; prerequisite knowledge; and transition point in the information continuum. Within the context of potential LAM education convergence, one of the fundamental questions is the extent to which offerings must vary based on the professional, disciplinary, institutional, organizational, or cultural context in which students plan to work. LAM convergence is not likely to result in complete unification, but the growing importance of digital curation activities in supporting the missions of all three types of institutions poses exciting new opportunities for collaboration in professional education."

Wakita,2010,"Multimodal digital archiving and reproduction of the world cultural heritage Gion Festival in Kyoto""""","We propose a multimodal digital archiving and reproduction of the world cultural heritage Gion Festival in Kyoto"". In this digital museum project, we make ""Virtual Kyoto"" more highly-developed and detailed, and develop the system where users can experience the things and events related to Gion Festival with several virtual reality technologies. Specifically, we develop the interactive system based on human five senses such as the contents where users can experience high-defined decorations of Yamahoko with visual and haptic senses, the high-quality sounds of the Festival music and the virtual Yamahoko float ceremony in the 3D vision environment combined these contents. ""Virtual Kyoto"" is 4 dimensionality city model with GIS and VR technologies, and the platform where the aspect of historical city, Kyoto can be rendered from past to present. Therefore, users can select any period and location and experience the contents of histories, cultures, arts and entertainments in ""Virtual Kyoto"". Moreover, we can not only handle high order contents but also describe many kinds of contents synthesizing them. This paper describes a multimodal digital archiving and reproduction of Gion Festival and virtual experience of parading of floats in detail.

J. A. Olson,2010,Data as a service: Are we in the clouds?,"John A. Olson, Syracuse University, New York, USA shares his views on the geographical data management and cloud computing. The strength of institutional repositories (IRs) is their emphasis on long-term preservation; however, the problem of data migration, including GIS data, has not been resolved. There are several new or newer associated activities in the data IR world, thus new terms related to data gathering and storage are spreading through the workplaces such as daas, cloud-based storage, cloud sourcing and cloud computing. The Library of Congress is experimenting with cloud-based storage, to provide a platform for federal agencies to share and provide access to their internal data clouds for access by federal employees and the public. The associated activity with the cloud project is called 'crowd computing', as the crowd-based projects are more likely to be locally created and have details and features that commercial data sets do not have."
J. A. Toque; Y. Sakatoku; A. Ide-Ektessabi,2010,Analytical imaging of cultural heritage paintings using digitally archived images,"Interests in cultural heritage have grown tremendously in the past few years. These interests vary from preservation, restoration, inspection and archiving just to name a few. Access to cultural heritage is very limited. Therefore, it is important to maximize such opportunity to gather as much information as possible from the cultural heritage. In this study, a technique was proposed to extract analytical information from digitally archived images. The images were acquired at high resolution using a flatbed scanner equipped with a line CCD under fluorescent light illumination. The images were used to reconstruct spectral reflectance using the pseudoinverse method. The results were used for pigment identification and investigation on degradation. Three methods were explored in computing the conversion matrix which contains information from the light source and the camera based on over 600 Japanese pigments as learning samples: (1) use of all pigments in the database; (2) exclusion of some pigments if historical information is available on the sample; and (3) color classification using L*C*H* color space. The technique was applied to the analysis of a real cultural heritage, a hanging scroll painting called Dragon King Zennyo Ryu'o (classified as a Japanese National Treasure, dated 1145) found in Koya Mountain in Japan. The analytical information extracted from the archived images provided insights on the degradation process the painting underwent. In addition, the traces of material detected from the analysis, give art historians scientific proof in creating historical footprints for this precious cultural artifact. This study demonstrated how archived RGB images could be used for the noninvasive and nondestructive investigation of actual cultural heritage. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering."

However, with this specialization and subsequent formation of a dedicated subgroup of researchers active in this field, limitations of the challenges addressed can be observed. Digital preservation research may seem to react to problems arising, fixing problems that exist now, rather than proactively researching new solutions that may be applicable only after a few years of maturing. Recognising the benefits of bringing together researchers and practitioners with various professional backgrounds related to digital preservation, a seminar was organized in Schloss Dagstuhl, at the Leibniz Center for Informatics (18-23 July 2010), with the aim of addressing the current digital preservation challenges, with a specific focus on the automation aspects in this field. The main goal of the seminar was to outline some research challenges in digital preservation, providing a number of research questions"" that could be immediately tackled, e.g. in Doctoral Thesis. The seminar intended also to highlight the need for the digital preservation community to reach out to IT research and other research communities outside the immediate digital preservation domain, in order to jointly develop solutions. © 2010 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

While not a standards-making body, the Project, directed by Dr. Luciana Duranti and based at the University of British Columbia in Canada, has established meaningful baselines and benchmarks for assessing the authenticity and reliability of records. These tools are applied to preserve or assess the continuing trustworthiness of records as they inevitably pass through technological transitions, whether across systems or jurisdictions or over time. The work focuses on a close association of the record creators with trusted preservers, charged with ensuring that records preserved can be trusted by users.

J.-E. Baek; S. Sugimoto,2010,Feature Analysis of Metadata Schemas for Records Management and Archives from the Viewpoint of Records Lifecycle,"Digital resources are widely used in our modern society. However, we are facing fundamental problems to maintain and preserve digital resources over time. Several standard methods for preserving digital resources have been developed and are in use. It is widely recognized that metadata is one of the most important components for digital archiving and preservation. There are many metadata standards for archiving and preservation of digital resources, where each standard has its own feature in accordance with its primary application. This means that each schema has to be appropriately selected and tailored in accordance with a particular application. And, in some cases, those schemas are combined in a larger frame work and container metadata such as the DCMI application framework and METS. There are many metadata standards for archives of digital resources. We used the following metadata standards in this study for the feature analysis me metadata standards - AGLS Metadata which is defined to improve search of both digital resources and non-digital resources, ISAD(G) which is a commonly used standard for archives, EAD which is well used for digital archives, OAIS which defines a metadata framework for preserving digital objects, and PREMIS which is designed primarily for preservation of digital resources. In addition, we extracted attributes from the decision tree defined for digital preservation process by Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC) and compared the set of attributes with these metadata standards. This paper shows the features of these metadata standards obtained through the feature analysis based on the records lifecycle model. The features are shown in a single frame work which makes it easy to relate the tasks in the lifecycle to metadata elements of these standards. As a result of the detailed analysis of the metadata elements, we clarified the features of the standards from the viewpoint of relationships between the elements and the lifecycle stages. Mapping between metadata schemas is often required in the long-term preservation process because different schemes are used in the records lifecycle. Therefore, it is crucial to build a unified framework to enhance interoperability of these schemes. This study presents a basis for the interoperability of different metadata schemas used in digital archiving and preservation."

The meanings of cultural resources are mentioned historically and archaeologically. The culture dynamic is introduced and the cultural resources are interpreted as processes and practices along with which culture is produced and reproduced through the action of individual. Digital archiving concluds that the cultural resources are only meaningful when they are archived with their contexts and processes. Finally paper induces that cultural archives could be valuable, when they are preserved (synthetic), recognized (contextual) and enjoyed (exhibited, experienced or practically used)."

K. Rechert; D. Von Suchodoletz; R.

Archiving and preservation organizations are posed with large amounts of such objects of various types. At some point they will need to process these automatically to make them available to their users or convert them to a commonly used format. A substantial problem is to provide a wide range of different users with access to ancient environments and to allow using the original environment for a given object. We propose an abstract architecture for emulation services in digital preservation to provide remote user interfaces to emulation over computer networks without the need to install additional software components. Furthermore, we describe how these ideas can be integrated in a framework of web services for common preservation tasks like viewing or migrating digital objects. © 2010 ACM."

M. Dougherty,2010,Quest for an advanced image standard: A report from the trenches,"The advancement of science thrives on futuristic imagery. Such images can be abstractly n-dimensional and physically multimodal. They frequently consist of very large quantities of pixels that must be sub-sampled at multiple resolutions. Because there does not exist even one generic image standard for their long-term preservation and interoperations, researchers have no other option than to devise their own. Consequently, each scientific community maintains non-optimal and divergent pixel protocols for reasons of haste, convenience, performance and sometimes archiving, putting an unnecessary burden on future stewardship. Over the last five years, a number of distinct bio-imaging communities began discussing the need for a common pixel storage standard, which has also attracted the interest of astrophysicists, astronomers, and geographic information scientists. Such an advanced image design should build upon existing standards, particularly the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), the Motion Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) framework, and the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). HDF5 is a de-facto standard in use in many fields of science and engineering because of its superlative features such as high computational performance, extensible multimodal multi-dimensional data designs, selfdocumentation, reliable open source software support, and archiving that is amenable to OAIS. The de-jure MPEG standard offers excellent methods for video compression, content description, intellectual property management, and multimedia interoperability. The integration of these venerable standards offers the best strategy to satisfy the immediate and long-term needs for an essential coin-of-the-realm for pixels. Described in this paper is an outline of issues that should be considered in an advanced scientific image standard."

M. Guttenbrunner; J. Wieners; A. Rauber; M.

It can be either in the form of interactive virtual representations of non-digital objects like buildings or nature, but also as born digital materials like interactive art and video games. To preserve these materials for a long term, we need to perform preservation actions on them. To check the validity of these actions, the original and the preserved form have to be compared. While static information like images or text documents can be migrated to new formats, especially digital objects which are interactive have to be preserved using new rendering environments. In this paper we show how the results of rendering an object in different environments can be compared. We present a workflow with three stages that supports the execution of digital objects in a rendering environment, the application of interactive actions in a standardized way to ensure no deviations due to different interactions, and the XCL Layout processor application that extends the characterized screenshots of the rendering results by adding information about significant areas in the screenshot allowing us to compare the rendering results. We present case studies on interactive fiction and a chess program that show that the approach is valid and that the rendering results can be successfully compared. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

M. R. Landgraf; K. Zwaard; R. Haun-Mohamed; J. Mauldin,2010,"Digital preservation framework, goals, and challenges at the U.S. Government Printing Office","For nearly 150 years, the United States Government Printing Office (GPO) has kept America informed by producing and distributing Federal government information products. GPO combines conventional technology with state-of-the-art methods whether providing public access to Government information online, or producing or procuring printed publications that serve the information needs of the U.S. Congress, Federal agencies and the American public. Established by Congress to ensure that the American public has access to its Government's information, the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) involves the acquisition, format conversion, and distribution of depository materials and the coordination of Federal depository libraries in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories. The mission of the FDLP is to disseminate information products from all three branches of the Government to over 1, 230 libraries nationwide. In response to the growing need to have a centralized repository of Federal Government content, GPO is developing the Federal Digital System (FDsys) (www.fdsys.gov), which manages, authenticates, preserves, and provides access to Federal Government information. The system went live in beta in January of 2009. When fully implemented, FDsys will provide the American people a one stop site to authentic, published government information. The system is envisioned as a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving any type of digital content, independent of specific hardware and/or software. Six months after launch, FDsys was named one of the top government websites by Government Computer News. This paper will give an overview of the current activities and future goals of the U.S. Government Printing Office in the acquisition, preservation, and providing of public access to digital content available through the FDLP via FDsys. GPO acquires digital content through three vehicles: deposit of publications directly from the authoring agency, conversion of content from print, and harvesting of content from the web. Through FDsys, GPO plans to expand its ability to directly accept digital government publications, and will maintain authenticity and digital provenance. In addition, GPO plans to acquire publications through automated harvesting of born digital content from Federal agency websites, and to embark on an effort to digitize the entire historical collection made available through the FDLP. Together, these three methods of capture will form a publicly accessible, comprehensive collection of Federal publications that fall within the scope of the FDLP. GPO will assist the public in finding these publications through the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications, a robust source of descriptive metadata, and through the state-of-the art search tools on FDsys. Additionally, XML of select publications is available for direct download. GPO employs sound practices to ensure its digital content will be usable and accessible in perpetuity to the general public. GPO is developing FDsys in accordance with the OAIS reference model and has crafted its requirements to meet the standards set forth in the Trusted Repository Audit Checklist once FDsys is fully implemented. Self describing Archival Information Packages are stored in a preservation repository that is separated from most used portions of the system. Preservation metadata is discerned and persisted using the PREMIS data dictionary, including a full record of provenance/authenticity information."

Marshall,2010,A linked data approach to sharing workflows and workflow results,"A bioinformatics analysis pipeline is often highly elaborate, due to the inherent complexity of biological systems and the variety and size of datasets. A digital equivalent of the 'Materials and Methods' section in wet laboratory publications would be highly beneficial to bioinformatics, for evaluating evidence and examining data across related experiments, while introducing the potential to find associated resources and integrate them as data and services. We present initial steps towards preserving bioinformatics 'materials and methods' by exploiting the workflow paradigm for capturing the design of a data analysis pipeline, and RDF to link the workflow, its component services, run-time provenance, and a personalized biological interpretation of the results. An example shows the reproduction of the unique graph of an analysis procedure, its results, provenance, and personal interpretation of a text mining experiment. It links data from Taverna, myExperiment.org, BioCatalogue.org, and ConceptWiki.org. The approach is relatively 'light-weight' and unobtrusive to bioinformatics users. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

The system is deployed at over 200 libraries around the world and currently preserving titles of publishers representing more than 2000 academic titles. It consists of a large number of independent, low-cost, persistent Web caches that cooperate to detect and repair damage to their content by voting in opinion polls."" Based on our experience working with the LOCKSS system, in this paper, we identify and characterize a fundamental tradeoff in the system's ability to defend against adversaries with competing goals. In particular, the techniques used to defend against adversaries attempting stealth modification of content being preserved in the system are at odds with those used to identify nuisance adversaries simply trying to disrupt system procedures. We show that with a simple change to the design of the system's preservation protocol we are able to create moderately strong defense against both of these competing adversaries simultaneously. © 2009 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC."""
M. Schott; C. Krätzer; J. Dittmann; C. Vielhauer,2010,Extending the Clark-Wilson security model for digital long-term preservation use-cases,"A continuously growing amount of information of today exists not only in digital form but were actually born-digital. These informations need be preserved as they are part of our cultural and scientific heritage or because of legal requirements. As many of these information are born-digital they have no analog origin, and cannot be preserved by traditional means without losing their original representation. Thus digital long-term preservation becomes continuously important and is tackled by several international and national projects like the US National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program [1], the German NESTOR project [2] and the EU FP7 SHAMAN Integrated Project [3]. In digital long-term preservation the integrity and authenticity of the preserved information is of great importance and a challenging task considering the requirement to enforce both security aspects over a long time often assumed to be at least 100 years. Therefore in a previous work [4] we showed the general feasibility of the Clark-Wilson security model [5] for digital long-term preservation in combination with a syntactic and semantic verification approach [6] to tackle these issues. In this work we do a more detailed investigation and show exemplarily the influence of the application of such a security model on the use cases and roles of a digital long-term preservation environment. Our goals is a scalable security model - i.e. no fixed limitations of usable operations, users and objects - for mainly preserving integrity of objects but also ensuring authenticity. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering."
M. Schott; C. Krätzer; N. Specht; J. Dittmanna; C. Vielhauer,2010,Ensuring integrity and authenticity for images in digital long-term preservation,"Digital long-term preservation has become an important topic not only in the preservation domain, but also due to facilitation by several national and international projects like US National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program [1], the German NESTOR project [2] and the EU FP7 SHAMAN Integrated Project [3]. The reason for this is that a large part of nowadays produced documents and other goods are digital in nature and even some - called born-digital"" - have no analog master. Thus a great part of our cultural and scientific heritage for the coming generations is digital and needs to be preserved as reliable as it is the case for physical objects even surviving hundreds of years. However, the continuously succession of new hardware and software generations coming in very short intervals compared to the mentioned time spans render digital objects from just some generations ago inaccessible. Thus they need to be migrated on new hardware and into newer formats. At the same time integrity and authenticity of the preserved information is of great importance and needs to be ensured. However this becomes a challenging task considering the long time spans and the necessary migrations which alter the digital object. Therefore in a previous work [4] we introduced a syntactic and semantic verification approach in combination with the Clark-Wilson security model [5]. In this paper we present a framework to ensure the security aspects of integrity and authenticity of digital objects especially images from the time of their submission to a digital long-term preservation system (ingest) up to its latter access and even past this. The framework especially describes how to detect if the digital object has retained both of its security aspects while at the same allowing changes made to it by migration. © 2010 SPIE."""
M. Seadle,2010,Archiving in the networked world: interoperability,"Purpose The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of, and problems with, interoperability along long term digital archiving systems. Design/methodology/approach The article reviews the literature about interoperability and takes an engineeringoriented look at implementation within the LuKII project. It also draws heavily on actual experience in the LuKII (LOCKSS und KOPAL Infrastructure und Interoperabilität) project. Findings The need for interoperation is well established, but the implementation requires significant technical work to define and test key aspects of interoperability. Originality/value The need for interoperation among digital archiving systems is very much there, but achieving it is hard. Systems built at different times and along different principles require a degree of reengineering that can test the skills (and sometimes the patience) of the creators. Interoperability also requires fresh thinking about how archiving systems can reasonably measure important abstract concepts like integrity and authenticity. © 2010, . All rights reserved."
M. Smorul; S. Song; J. JaJa,2010,Monitoring distributed collections using the Audit Control Environment (ACE),"The Audit Control Environment (ACE) is a system which provides a scalable, auditable platform that actively monitors collections to ensure their integrity over the lifetime of an archive. It accomplishes this by using a small integrity token issued for each monitored item. This token is part of a larger externally auditable cryptographic system. We will describe how this system has been implemented for a set of applications designed to run in an archive or library environment. ACE has been used for almost two years by the Chronopolis Preservation Environment to monitor the integrity of collections replicated between the three independent archive partners. During this time, ACE has been expanded to better support the requirements of this distributed archive. We will describe how ACE has been used and expanded to support the Chronopolis preservation requirements. We conclude by discussing several future requirements for integrity monitoring that have been identified by users of ACE. These include securely monitoring remote data, monitoring offline data, and scaling monitoring activities in a way that does not impact the normal operational activity of an archive."

Aoki,2010,A stereo one-shot multi-band camera system for accurate color reproduction,"In the digital archiving for cultural heritage preservation, in the medical field, and in some industrial fields, high-fidelity reproduction of color, gloss, texture, and shape are very important. Multiband or full-spectrum imaging technology is a solution for accurate color reproduction. Although several types of multi band camera systems have been developed [Yamaguchi 2000, Tominaga 2000, Helling 2004, Hashimoto 2008], all of them are multi-shot systems and they cannot take images of moving objects. Ohsawa et al. [2004] have developed a six-band HDTV camera system. However, the system requires very expensive customized equipment. In order to make multiband technology pervasive, equipment costs must be reduced and the systems have to be able to take images of moving objects. To meet these requirements, we developed a novel multiband image capturing system that combines multiband and stereo imaging techniques. This system can acquire both spectral color information and depth information at the same time. In this paper, we focus on the generation of six-band images from a pair of stereo image. © ACM 2010."

Borghoff,2010,State-of-the-art survey of long-term archiving – strategies in the context of geo-data / cartographic heritage,"Long-term preservation of digital artifacts is a quite young discipline in computer science whose relevance is rising constantly. Most approaches to long-term preservation rely either on the migration of the digital artifacts or on the emulation of their rendering environment. The popular migration approach is used to archive simple or automatically transformable document formats like texts and pictures. Within recent years, acceptance of the emulation approach has grown significantly. It appears to be particularly well suited for archiving complex digital objects, which highly depend on the rendering environment they have been designed for. This includes complex databases, entire applications, and even graphical, real-time computer games. This article gives an overview of both approaches and explores their suitability for the long-term preservation of geo-data in particular. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
N. Milic-Frayling,2010,Digital Objects Characterization: Document Conversion and Quality Assurance,"Whether we are migrating document formats to achieve interoperability or ensure long term preservation, we are faced with the issue of assessing the quality of the digital object transformation. However, comparing two digital objects is not straightforward. It raises the issue of properties that are inherent to the digital objects and those that are dependent on the environment in which the objects are created, viewed, and compared to one another. That has implications for devising methods to extract document properties, interpret observed characteristics, and apply similarity metrics. Furthermore, in order to take actions based on collected measurements, we need to define or learn the significance of individual document properties from the perspective of human perception and usage scenarios. We illustrate the complexity of these issues by presenting a method for comparing converted office documents and discussing the challenges from the technical and methodology point of view. © 2010 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings.

We have prototyped a set of e-services that serve as a framework for understanding content preservation, automation and computational requirements on preservation of electronic records. The framework consists of e-services for (a) finding file format conversion software, (b) executing file format conversions using available software, and (c) evaluating information loss across conversions. While the target audience for the technology is the US National Archives, these basic eservices are of interest to any manager of electronic records and to all citizens trying to keep their files current with the rapidly changing information technology. The novelty of the framework is in organizing the information about file format conversions, providing services about file format conversion paths, in prototyping a general architecture for reusing existing third-party software with import/export capabilities, and in evaluating information loss due to file format conversions. The impact of these e-services is in the widely accessible conversion software registry (CSR), conversion engine (Polyglot) and comparison engine (Versus) which can increase the productivity of the digital preservation community and other users of digital files.

P. Caplan,2010,"DAITSS, an OAIS-based preservation repository","DAITSS is a preservation repository application developed by the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) for use by the Florida Digital Archive (FDA), a digital repository shared by the eleven universities in the Florida public university system. DAITSS is strictly modeled on the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS). DAITSS can accept a Submission Information Package (SIP), transform the SIP into a stored Archival Information Package (AIP), and transform the AIP into a Dissemination Information Package (DIP) on request. To do so, it directly implements four of the six OAIS functional entities: Ingest, Data Management, Archival Storage, and Access. Functions of the remaining two entities, Administration and Preservation Planning, are performed by FDA staff with support from DAITSS reporting and data management functions. DAITSS is unique among repository applications in that it was designed to ensure the long-term renderability of authentic digital materials. In contrast to Private LOCKSS Networks, which do little but replicate data, DAITSS implements active preservation strategies, maintains standardized preservation metadata including digital provenance, and performs continuous fixity checking on multiple stored copies. The preservation protocol implemented by DAITSS combines bit-level preservation, format normalization, and forward format migration. FCLA will be releasing a second version of the DAITSS application (DAITSS 2) as a sequence of RESTful web services in 2010, at which time the code and documentation will be freely available for other institutions to use."
P. Caplan,2010,The Florida digital archive and DAITSS: A model for digital preservation,"Purpose: This paper aims to describe the Florida Digital Archive (FDA), a long-term preservation repository for the use of the public university system of Florida, and the DAITSS preservation repository application used by the FDA. It seeks to explain requirements that shaped DAITSS design, outline functions of the current software, and describe how DAITSS is being rearchitected as a series of Web Services (DAITSS 2). It also endeavours to place the FDA and DAITSS in the context of various models for implementing digital preservation functions. Design/methodology/approach: This is a case study of one model of digital preservation implementation that includes some comparison with examples of other models. The preservation protocol implemented by DAITSS combines bit-level preservation, format normalization, and forward format migration; extensive preservation and format-specific metadata are supported, and authenticity of content is maintained through application design and a complete record of digital provenance. Findings: The formal OAIS model has much to offer, and DAITSS could be part of a preservation solution for large academic/research libraries and for consortia who can share central computing facilities and staff. Practical implications: When DAITSS 2 is completed and implemented by the Florida Digital Archive, the code will be released for use under an open source license. Institutions, consortia and third party service providers looking for a more complete preservation solution than simple replication can consider using DAITSS 2 as their digital preservation repository application. Originality/value: There are very few preservation repository applications that do nothing but digital preservation, do it well, and formally implement the OAIS model. The Florida Digital Archive's DAITSS was the first of its kind in the USA. DAITSS 2 will conform to the same requirements as DAITSS and will retain the same functionality, but it will be easier to implement and manage in production, and easier to maintain and enhance. © ."

TIPR is based on the assumption that responsibility for long-term digital preservation must be distributed across a number of stewardship organizations running heterogeneous and geographically dispersed repositories. For reasons of redundancy, succession planning and software migration, these repositories must be able to exchange copies of archived information packages with each other. Practical repository-to-repository transfer will require a common, standards-based transfer format capable of transporting rich preservation metadata as well as digital objects, and repository systems must be capable of exporting and importing information packages utilizing this format. The project, which is reaching the midpoint of its second year, has drafted, implemented, and tested a specification for a Repository Exchange Package (RXP), a hierarchical packaging format designed to facilitate the exchange of Archival Information Packages (AIPs) between digital repositories. The RXP encodes structural and preservation metadata using METS and PREMIS, two widely used schema in the cultural heritage community. It is agnostic to the application software used by the sending or receiving repositories or the number of representations included in any AIP. Copyright 2010 ACM."

Through grid technologies, the SHAMAN framework promotes a distributed approach in preservation systems, whereby ingest, persistent storage, access, presentation and manipulation of digital information is managed for long-term consumption. In order to understand the ever-evolving requirements for functionality in information systems, the SHAMAN team, led by HATII at the University of Glasgow, conducted an in-depth investigation of user needs for preservation solutions. The results were used to inform the development of a corresponding Assessment Framework. The purpose of the Assessment Framework is to evaluate the degree that the SHAMAN outputs are consistent with the identified user requirements and to measure the overall success of the project. The SHAMAN outputs are instantiated as functional prototypes that reflect preservation requirements in three distinct domains: memory institutions, industrial design & engineering and e-Science. Following the specifications of the assessment framework, the software artefacts produced by SHAMAN for each prototype must be assessed to validate their conformance with user and system requirements. To this end, a software validation methodology has been devised, which builds on the SHAMAN Assessment Framework to verify that the SHAMAN software satisfies the reasons for its development. This paper documents the SHAMAN Assessment Framework and explicates the relationship between assessment and software validation in the SHAMAN project."

Yet for many small to medium sized archives and memory institutions there are still significant obstacles to implementing best practice solutions to meet the digital continuity requirements of their user communities. Three critical barriers are intellectual complexity, technical complexity and cost. Inspired by a call to action in a recent UNESCO Memory of the World report [1], the goal of the Archivematica project is to lower each of these barriers and give archivists the tools, methodology and confidence to begin preserving digital information today.

The system is free and full access is given to the source code repository and technical documentation under the open-source GPL license."
P. W. Jones; C. W. Honsinger,2010,Image quality assurance for the real world,"The need for quality assurance in image digitization programs has long been recognized by the cultural heritage and digital archiving communities. To that end, detailed quality guidelines, such as those from NARA and Metamorfoze, have been produced and shared within these communities as an essential first step in driving the adoption of i) quantitative quality metrics and ii) common approaches to the calculation of such metrics. These quality metrics are fidelity-based in that they address the question: Is the digitized image an accurate representation of the original content or object? Examples of such fidelity-based metrics are spatial frequency response (SFR) to assess sharpness, opto-electronic conversion function (OECF) to assess tonescale reproduction, and flat-field standard deviation to assess noise. These measurements are produced from captured images of one or more test targets, which serve as reference input signals. While these efforts are important and necessary, they are not entirely sufficient when it comes to implementing quality assurance programs in real-world production environments. In this paper, we'll discuss the next steps that are required to make quality assurance more than an academic exercise. These steps include fully automated, real-time quality analysis that integrates seamlessly and easily into a digitization workflow; simple and convenient quality metadata management; efficient exception handling to identify and fix quality problems; and quality metrics that go beyond current fidelity-based metrics. Our company, Certifi Media, develops technology and solutions to specifically meet these real-world quality assurance needs. In this paper, we'll discuss how a practical quality assurance program can be implemented with such technology and solutions."
P. Wittenburg; P. Trilsbeek; P.

The bases for the documentation of these languages are audio/video recordings which are then annotated at several linguistic layers. The digital age completely changed the requirements of long-term preservation and it is discussed how the archive met these new challenges. An extensive solution for data replication has been worked out to guarantee bit-stream preservation. Due to an immediate conversion of the incoming data to standards-based formats and checks at upload time lifecycle management of all 50 Terabyte of data is widely simplified. A suitable metadata framework not only allowing users to describe and discover resources, but also allowing them to organize their resources is enabling the management of this amount of resources very efficiently. Finally, it is the Language Archiving Technology software suite which allows users to create, manipulate, access and enrich all archived resources given that they have access permissions."
Q. L. Nguyen; A. Lake; M. Huber,2010,Content Server Architecture Pattern for evolvability and scalability,"Significant requirements for a large digital preservation system are the system scalability, its ability to store and service heterogeneous digital holdings, and the evolvability over time of both the technologies comprising the system and the data formats in its storage. The use of information technology by the government, business corporations, academic institutions, and the general public results in staggering amounts of digitalborn materials requiring long-term preservation and access. Organizations in different domains have to cope with the daunting task of storing and providing access to the growing amount of digital data. In many cases data heterogeneity, which ranges from office automation and geospatial images, to multimedia artifacts, adds to the challenge. In response to these challenges, we propose a Content Server Architecture Pattern. Content Server Architecture Pattern can be applied for instantiation of data-centric architecture, service-centric architecture, storage technology-centric architecture or an architecture that is some hybrid of that set to implement a Content Server Repository portion of a digital preservation system. A key characteristic of Content Server Architecture Pattern is its versatility that allows tailoring of the architecture of a digital preservation system to specific business needs. © 2010 IEEE."
Q. L. Nguyen; A. Lake; M. Huber,2010,Evolvable and scalable system of content servers for a large digital preservation archives,"Building a large-scale digital preservation archives system (LDPAS) for long-term access is a challenging endeavor. The three most significant system requirements contributing to that challenge are the scalability of the system, accommodation of heterogeneous digital holdings, and the evolvability of both the constituting technologies and the data formats in storage. The amount of digital-born materials requiring long-term preservation and access is overwhelming due to the fast pace of information technology and its widespread utilization in government, business corporations, academic institutions, and the general public. Compounding to the data volume challenge is the heterogeneity of the data, which range from the products of office automation and geospatial images, to multimedia artifacts. Storing and preserving digital objects must be accomplished in a way that allows access to the objects independently of the platform technology and software applications used to create these objects. As the technologies change rapidly, the LDPAS must accommodate the changes to its benefit, while also increasing in scale. A successful LDPAS must be able to adapt to the two-fold evolutionary demands. The evolution of the system software with time is the norm in any large-scale long-term system. But, even more important is the system's capability to cope with the evolution of the very software applications that generated the digital objects archived within it. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a system of Content Servers, which can scale with the data volume growth, continually sustain evolution in the face of technological change, and provide different levels of service to the different kinds of users accessing the LDPAS. We describe the concept, components and services of a Content Server in the context of digital archiving, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) reference model. Several possible deployment configurations are shown to illustrate the efficient utilization of low level services and the flexibility of the system to scale up or down. ©2010 IEEE."

It explores these requirements in the context of automating re-appraisal and questions many of the assumptions commonly made about appraisal and about automating the processes needed for life-cycle management of digital objects. Design/methodology/approach: The literature of digital preservation and curation and the experience of one of the authors in planning to implement a digital archive at the Wellcome Library are the basis of an exploration of issues. Findings: The development of automated appraisal systems and associated tools is a worthwhile endeavour, although the complexity and cost associated with designing, developing and implementing them may be prohibitive in some situations. An automated appraisal system may, however, have only limited benefits in some contexts. The re-appraisal of technical attributes of digital materials, which is an essential part of their management, is a prime contender for some level of automation. The approach proposed has limitations which arise from such factors as metadata requirements and trustworthiness.

Data archives and digital repository systems are being developed to preserve current and legacy scientific data and technical information for use by others. However, capabilities are needed for data producers of various disciplines to easily and efficiently submit their data into archival systems for preservation. Analysis of digital preservation requirements has identified the requirements for services to support the submission and review of scientific data for preservation. Data submission and review processes are segmented into services, which are defined to support efficient preparation of scientific data for ingest into an archive or digital repository system. A model is proposed to inform the design of submission and workflow services for preserving interdisciplinary scientific data. Recommendations are offered for improving the design and evaluation of systems and services to prepare and preserve scientific data for new uses by interdisciplinary communities of users in the future.

Scientific data archives can offer capabilities for managing and preserving disciplinary and interdisciplinary data for research, education, and decision-making activities of future communities of users. Meeting the requirements for a trusted digital repository will help to ensure that today's collections of scientific data will be available in the future. A continuing self-assessment of a long-term archive for interdisciplinary scientific data is being conducted to identify the additional steps needed for it to become a trustworthy repository. Recommendations include a strategy for collaborative organizational sustainability, a model for submission and workflow to ingest interdisciplinary scientific data into a repository, and a plan for facilitating intra-organizational transfer between repositories."
R. Sanderson; H. Van De Sompel,2010,Making web annotations persistent over time,"As Digital Libraries (DL) become more aligned with the web architecture, their functional components need to be fundamentally rethought in terms of URIs and HTTP. Annotation, a core scholarly activity enabled by many DL solutions, exhibits a clearly unacceptable characteristic when existing models are applied to the web: due to the representations of web resources changing over time, an annotation made about a web resource today may no longer be relevant to the representation that is served from that same resource tomorrow. We assume the existence of archived versions of resources, and combine the temporal features of the emerging Open Annotation data model with the capability offered by the Memento framework that allows seamless navigation from the URI of a resource to archived versions of that resource, and arrive at a solution that provides guarantees regarding the persistence of web annotations over time. More specifically, we provide theoretical solutions and proof-of-concept experimental evaluations for two problems: reconstructing an existing annotation so that the correct archived version is displayed for all resources involved in the annotation, and retrieving all annotations that involve a given archived version of a web resource. © 2010 ACM."

The project develops an integrated environment that allows archivists to seamlessly utilize and evaluate tools and strategies for the preservation of cultural heritage data. The Planets Interoperability Framework (IF) supports this vision by providing the technical backbone for integrating existing content repositories, preservation tools, and services into a service-oriented research infrastructure. It implements a number of common software components for user authentication, data access, or service orchestration. Moreover, it defines the interfaces and communication protocols for preservation services like identification, characterization, migration or rendering. It thereby assures the interoperability of the various heterogeneous preservation tools and applications in order to establish a coherent and extensible preservation system.

R. Sharpe; C. Henshaw; D. Thompson,2010,"Managing visually lossless"" compression with JPEG2000""","Images, especially images that have been created as a result of digitization, can be very large in an uncompressed format. Hence, it is desirable to compress images without losing human-visible features. One way of achieving this is to use the JPEG2000 format. It has been found that compression ratios of up to 40:1 have not impaired legibility or the accuracy of OCR. However, to meet anticipated uses, long-term preservation suggests a more conservative policy should be followed. The Wellcome Library intends to use JPEG2000 for digitization projects using the JP2 file format using Part 1 compression incorporating multiple resolution layers and tiling. The Library has commissioned a study (see http://library.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx056572.pdf) into the features of JPEG2000 that has made the following major recommendations for the generated JPEG2000 datastream: • Use irreversible compression using the 9-7 wavelet transform and ICT with minimal loss • Use multiple resolutions levels: the number depends on the original image size and the desired size of the smallest image derived from the JPEG 2000 datasteam • Use multiple quality layers, where all layers gives minimally lossy compression for preservation • Place the lowest resolution sub-image first in the datastream to give fast access to thumbnails When performing a format migration, it would be ideal if the unexpected or unintentional loss of features could be measured in an automatic workflow so that an early indication of possible problems can be achieved. Tessella's Active Preservation system has the capability to achieve this. This works by characterizing images before and after a migration. For example, a characterization tool can be used to extract key properties and then compare the values this generates before and after migration. For core properties, this comparison is simple since the values should be identical (possibly with an appropriate tolerance range). For other properties, comparison can be more complicated. For example, Active Preservation can create three histograms of colors (one for each of red, green and blue channels) and then compare these histograms to see if all the histograms are sufficiently similar. This technique is quite sensitive to changes in appearance. This automated verification means that, after determining and setting up parameters, the quality of the migration can be assured without requiring human intervention. It also opens up the possibility of tuning the appropriate compression level on a case-by-case basis depending on the properties of each individual image."

The Web has become the most important information environment which supports different kinds of activities at universities, including research and teaching. To fulfill their mission of being institutions where excellence is expected in both of these two activities, universities must provide access to digital content and support its long-term preservation. Academic libraries help universities in realization of these two tasks by offering their holdings and services to researchers, teachers and students. By doing that, libraries support development of e-learning. This paper will present results from research in academic libraries at the University of Zagreb regarding opinions and attitudes of library heads about digital information resources and digital content, and their use in teaching and research."

The preservation of such data is increasingly important given the development of ever-increasingly complex models to predict the effects of global climate change. The EU METAFOR project has developed a Common Information Model (CIM) to describe climate data and the models and modelling environments that produce this data. There is a wide degree of variability between different climate models and modelling groups. To accommodate this, the CIM has been designed to be highly generic and flexible, with extensibility built in. METAFOR describes the climate modelling process simply as an activity undertaken using software on computers to produce data."" This process has been described as separate UML packages (and, ultimately, XML schemas). This fairly generic structure can be paired with more specific ""controlled vocabularies"" in order to restrict the range of valid CIM instances. The CIM will aid digital preservation of climate models as it will provide an accepted standard structure for the model metadata. Tools to write and manage CIM instances, and to allow convenient and powerful searches of CIM databases,. Are also under development. Community buy-in of the CIM has been achieved through a continual process of consultation with the climate modelling community, and through the METAFOR team's development of a questionnaire that will be used to collect the metadata for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model runs. © 2010 ACM."""
S. Adam,2010,Preserving authenticity in the digital age,"Purpose: In this increasingly digital world, archivists have had to reconsider early definitions and measures of authenticity in order to ensure their applicability to the process of preserving digital records. This paper sets out to explore the complexities involved in defining and preserving the authenticity of digital files. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on literature from the field to present a comprehensive overview of traditional definitions of authenticity and highlight the shifting nature of those definitions in the digital age. The discussion begins with a look at traditional archival understandings of authenticity as they relate to physical objects. The paper goes on to examine these challenges and efforts and includes a look at the resource demands and technology tools currently used to evaluate digital authenticity. The paper conducted extensive research on the subject to compile source materials and draw conclusions. Findings: This paper highlights the inherent challenge of establishing and maintaining pertinent criteria for authenticity when archivists are, for the most part, electing to reformat and effectively change digital records in order to ensure their long-term preservation. Practical implications: This paper includes practical implications for redefining, measuring, and preserving the authenticity of digital records. Social implications: This paper has social implications in that it asserts a need to question the well-established understanding of what it means to be authentic.

S. Dunne; M. Lerkenfeld,2010,Digital archiving: A call for user inspired digital archiving of cultural heritage,"Recently, there has been an increasing amount of digital archiving projects. Among these, national broadcasting organisations have begun offering digital content free to the public. The amount of digitalised information is increasing, though no one seems to be able to answer the question of how the information should be archived in order to be beneficial in the future? Given the financial cost and legal practices such as copyright, digitalisation has been discussed and addressed from various angles; however, organisations still don't appear to focus on the end users, the distribution or how the public can benefit from a new type of archive. This paper explores different problems and ideas when developing new digital archive platforms with the purpose of making national broadcasting organisations' cultural content available to the public. Furthermore, we discuss methods of making information accessible and useful in terms of the characteristics digital media possesses. Finally, we call for new methods and approaches to the creation of user inspired digital archives, and the need for innovation in the standards of digital archiving related to public service."
S. Imfeld; R. Haller,2010,Pitfalls in preserving geoinformation - lessons from the Swiss National Park,"In the Swiss National Park (SNP) long-term research is one of the main objectives. Scientific data has been collected for almost 100 years, many of them in a geographical context within this alpine environment. The digital era started in 1992 when a geographical information system (GIS) was established. Over the years a considerable amount of analogue and digital data has been accumulated which the SNP is obliged to keep available for future research generations. As one of the few undisturbed reference areas for global change with such long-term data series, the preservation of the source data is of high importance as the value of data increases as the time series are and will be continuously updated. When preserving long-term scientific data in digital forms one inevitably faces a manifold of problems not found in traditional (non-digital) archiving. We identified a set of obstacles and pitfalls which can have catastrophic effects on both archive creation and maintenance in a small scaled organisation like the SNP. There are three main classes of threats to digital data and their archives: hardware, software, and brainware. The rapid developments in hardware and software are well known aspects making archiving of data and especially geodata a challenge by itself. One of the biggest threats to geodata is the so called brainware, i.e. users, data maintainers, system managers and on the long-term the heirs clearing the garret of their deceased ancestors, once brilliant researchers, unaware of their data collections’ value. The SNP has encountered multiple pitfalls in its effort to preserve geodata. The development of the GIS software with its regular updates and enhancements resulted in several losses of data due to format incompatibilities despite of sticking with the largest GIS software vendor throughout the years. In comparison, traditional media selection in non-digital archives seems to be idyllic, as paper is the most stable and endurable storage known for centuries. The mere volume of data handled at our Geo-data center amounts to several terabytes, posing considerable problems in terms of backup and archiving and especially archive maintenance. Metadata is an accepted key requirement without which data must be considered useless. Especially in long term data collections, metadata by itself does not sufficient. Current concepts for finding metadata focus on search engines with either unstructured or highly structured search strategies, unfortunately disregarding the fact that data must be embedded in knowledge retrieval systems spanning from traditional knowledge repositories (publications, libraries) with current digital content management systems and metainformation on data lineage. Such a meta-meta database system was developed for two research hotspots in nature reserves in Switzerland, currently containing roughly 3000 items. Further research is urgently needed for digital geodata archiving to improve technical and administrative aspects as well as to build a strong awareness in scientific disciplines that not only archiving publications but source data as well is a key component when trying to better understand our changing world. © 2010, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
S. Kataria; J. P. K. Anbu,2010,How safe is our digital tomorrow? Role of Libraries and information centers in digital preservation,"Libraries are in a bigger predicament to safeguard digital material as the preservation of digital information vastly differs from that of the traditional print material. Digital publications are taking the world by storm, whereas the storehouses of knowledge are finding it very difficult to safeguard these digital publications. The technological innovations, the obsolescence of hardware and software coupled with the inconsistent preservation techniques and standards pose greater problems for the libraries and information centres. Among myriad challenges in digital preservation, the important challenge is the preservation of digital contents within the context in which they were created. The role of libraries during these uncertain times especially in creating awareness among the creators and managers of digital documents, is to work towards a global digital preservation policy and invest in consortia to safeguard the digital information which will go a long way in safeguarding today's information for tomorrow's generation."

S. Morrissey,2010,The economy of free and open source software in the preservation of digital artefacts,"Purpose: Free and open source software (FOSS) brings many benefits to digital preservation; however it is not free"". If the context in which free and open source software tools are created and employed is examined, it becomes clear that: the sustainability of any software (FOSS, custom or commercial) to ensure the preservation of the digital heritage will depend on careful assessment of, and provision for, the costs (implicit and explicit) entailed in the production and continued employment of these tools. The purpose of this paper is to focus on FOSS and archiving of the digital heritage. Design/methodology/approach: Portico, a not-for-profit digital preservation service, explores the costs of FOSS based on its experiences as a working archive with an extremely long time horizon. Findings: There are considerable benefits to FOSS, including its openness and the broad-based testing of it in real-world situations. FOSS tools can provide considerable cost savings over proprietary tools. However, FOSS is neither free to use, nor to create, nor to maintain. Digital preservation organizations must inventory not only the FOSS tools in the preservation arsenal, but the network of sustaining tools (FOSS and otherwise), documentation, and ""tribal knowledge"" that make these tools effectively usable. The risks to sustainability of this network of resources must be assessed, and determine what it will cost to keep them viable. Strategies will have to be considered and implemented for providing the means to sustain these resources. An engaged community of use is the best guarantor of the vitality of any FOSS tool. As that community wanes, it becomes even more essential to capture the significant properties and domain knowledge about that tool. Creators of new software in the digital preservation space have a particular obligation to provide and maintain information about the significant properties of that software. Originality/value: The paper shows how Portico brings its practical experiences integrating multiple FOSS tools to bear on an analysis of the costs to creating and maintaining these tools over the long-term. © ."""

It seeks to consider in detail the cooperative model and the path it provides toward sustainability as well as how it fosters participation by cultural memory organizations and their administrators, who are concerned about what digital preservation will ultimately cost and who will pay. Design/methodology/approach: The authors cast light on the decisions that administrators of cultural memory organizations are making on a daily basis - namely, to preserve or not to preserve their digital collections. They assert that either way, a decision is being made, costs are incurred, and consequences are being levied. The authors begin by exploring the costs incurred by cultural memory organizations if they do not quickly establish digital preservation programs for their digital assets. They move then to look to the digital preservation field's preliminary findings regarding the costs of preserving digital assets and who should ideally subsidize this investment. Findings: The authors describe one economically sustainable digital preservation model in practice, the MetaArchive Cooperative, a distributed digital preservation network that has been in operation since 2004. The MetaArchive has built its economic sustainability model and has experienced successes with it for over five years. Originality/value: There are very few studies or articles in the literature that review studies on the economics of digital preservation and apply them to digital preservation initiatives in action.

However, accessing this information by using conventional database systems is too difficult for general users. To solve this, this paper proposes an associating, retrieval and display system for archeological information using huge 3D models of cultural heritage as interfaces to access information. To define target regions on 3D models, users can quickly select specific regions from huge models by using an interface that combines a splitting method by graph-cut and a lasso tool. In the display process, we achieved highly interactive rendering of huge 3D models by using an efficient 3D rendering algorithm on the basis of multi-resolution meshes."

As the size and complexity of digital collections increases how will curators classify, prioritize, capture, preserve, and present their historical holdings?"" To meet these requirements the Digital Information Division of the Michigan State University Libraries has called for a comprehensive inventory of its preservation quality digital collections. A comprehensive inventory will produce an index of collections and items (inventory), provide descriptive information (classification), summarize the state of preservation (assessment), and inform workflow (policy). The Data Asset Framework, formerly the Data Audit Framework, a standard tool for providing a representative audit, is modified to accommodate the scale and density of digital collections acquired by libraries. Modifications to the DAF include 1) automated tools for metadata extraction, checksum generation, and format authentication 2) file storage summaries using disk analysis reporting and container format specifications, and 3) a modified interview schedule to gather metadata at the collection level. One possible output of modifying the DAF to assess digital collections is the potential to map DAF data into PREMIS records for preservation purposes. This activity is unique on the collection level and enhanced reuse is the main benefit of such mapping. The stored XML data can be compared with new audit data for any updates and affords a novel means for tracking changes to digital objects at the collection level. This paper will detail the process used to 1) modify the DAF, 2) map DAF data elements into PREMIS and 3) build a business case for reuse for future audits.

This paper proposes a novel approach to performing partial matching of surfaces. Given two surfaces MA and MB, our goal is to find the best match to MA within MB. The key idea of our approach is to integrate feature-point similarity and segment similarity. Specifically, we introduce a probabilistic framework in which the segmentation and the correspondences of neighboring feature points allow us to enhance or moderate our certainty of a feature-point similarity. The utility of our algorithm is demonstrated in the domain of archaeology, where digital archiving is becoming ever more widespread. In this domain, automatic matching can serve as a worthy alternative to the expensive and time-consuming manual procedure that is used today. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radiography provides nondestructive options for assessment, digital preservation, and presentation of human skeletal remains; important for forensic and culturally sensitive archaeological materials, which must remain unmodified for opposing experts, future researchers, or repatriation and reburial. Radiographic techniques permit analysis of remains that cannot be disarticulated (e.g., religious proscription, mummies), and trabecular measures provide data where traditional surface indicators are obscured or damaged. Potentially, robust predictive models derived herein achieve R-values of 0.522, 0.447, and 0.731, respectively. Further testing of these methods may validate these techniques as further lines of evidence in age estimation, with the potential to improve on the accuracy of traditional qualitative techniques by providing quantitative, continuous variables in predicting skeletal age-at-death."

We explain how the Matrix can support the identification and organization of material to be addressed in professional education programs. This detailed articulation of digital curation activities reveals numerous opportunities to promote, advance, and further enhance the skills and capabilities of archivists. We present aspects of the DigCCurr Matrix that intersect with long-standing, archival competencies as well as discussing areas of potential growth and collaboration.

Considerable effort has been spent in the past on defining, implementing, and validating a framework and system for preservation planning. This article sheds light on the actual decision criteria and influence factors to be considered when choosing digital preservation actions. It is based on an extensive evaluation of case studies on preservation planning for a range of different types of objects with partners from different institutional backgrounds. We categorize decision criteria from a number of real-world decision-making instances in a taxonomy. We show that a majority of the criteria can be evaluated by applying automated measurements under realistic conditions, and demonstrate that controlled experimentation and automated measurements can be used to substantially improve repeatability of decisions and reduce the effort needed to evaluate preservation components. The presented measurement framework enables scalable preservation and monitoring and supports trust in preservation decisions because extensive evidence is produced in a reproducible, automated way and documented as the basis of decision making in a standardized form. © 2011 ASIS&T."

Human resources and investments in information technology are the major cost factors. After the initial stages, the analysis predicts annual costs of circa €4 million. The analysis compared scenarios with and without a shared LTP system. The results indicate that a shared system will have remarkable benefits. At the development and implementation stages, a shared system shows an advantage of €30 million against the alternative scenario consisting of five independent LTP solutions. During the later stages, the advantage is estimated at €10 million per annum. The cumulative cost benefit over the first 12 years would amount to circa €100 million."

Gbaje,2011,Digital preservation strategies: A case study of Nigerian national information centres,"This study examines digital preservation strategies in national information centres in Nigeria. Specifically the study tried to find out the digital preservation strategies and structures put in place for the implementation of the strategies adopted. The population of the study consists of the National Library of Nigeria, the National Archives of Nigeria and the National Bureau of Statistics. A case study and qualitative methodology approaches were adopted for the study. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed and administered to a focused group of five staff of the digital preservation/digitization unit of the population. The study discovered, among others, that migration is the most popular digital preservation strategy adopted and no structure to assess digital objects for preservation action is put in place. The study recommended that a National Centre for Digital Preservation, responsible for monitoring and conducting research in digital preservation activities, should be established. © The Author(s) 2011."

This project, co-funded by the EU, contains one of the first large worldwide surveys about digital preservation including most players of the STM information chain: researchers, libraries, data managers, publishers, and research funders. One of the conclusions is that in the present data deluge, it is extremely important that all players in the information chain work together on proper digital preservation of all research output, to ensure its future usability, understandability, and authenticity. This poses a new role for publishers who can ensure better discoverability and citability via good linking and integration of data and publications. © Eefke Smit, Jeffrey van der Hoeven, and David Giaretta 2011."

Spectral imaging systems have been used as a tool for non-invasive characterization of cultural heritage, allowing the collection of chemical identification information about materials without sampling. The Library of Congress has been developing the application of hyperspectral imaging to the preservation and analysis of cultural heritage materials as a powerful, non-contact technique to allow non-invasive characterization of materials, by identifying and characterizing colorants, inks and substrates through their unique spectral response, monitoring deterioration or changes due to exhibit and other environmental conditions, and capturing lost and deteriorated information. The resulting image cube creates a new digital cultural object"" that is related to, but recognized as a distinct entity from the original.

Duerig,2011,High density multi-level recording for archival data preservation,"Archival data storage is predominantly based on magnetic tape technology. An alternative probe based multi-level recording scheme is proposed which specifically addresses the issue of long term data preservation. In a first step, the data are written as topographic relief in an organic resist. To achieve long term preservation, the relief structure is transferred in a Si based inorganic carrier by means of reactive ion etching. Thereby, the data are preserved as written in stone. Using 3-level logic, a storage density of 99 Gb/in(2) is demonstrated and read-back of the data is accomplished with an error rate of 10(-3) based on threshold detection. Exploiting etch anisotropy in layered substrates, logic levels can be physically separated from one another in different layers which enhances tamper resistance and also provides a means for heterogeneous storage concepts.

F. Luan; M. Nygård,2011,MMET: A migration metadata extraction tool for long-term preservation systems,"Migration is the most often used preservation approach in long-term preservation systems. To design a migration plan, custodians need to know about technical infrastructure about a preservation system, characteristics and provenance about digital materials, restrictions about preservation activities, and policies about retention rules. However, current tools cannot provide all these information. They just can output information about formats and characteristics for several given formats. Hence, in this paper, we design a migration metadata extraction tool. This tool uses the stored metadata to retrieve the above information for the custodians. The test results show that due to the limitation on the stored metadata, our solution still cannot get the sufficient information. However, it outputs more migration metadata and has better performance than current tools. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, current metadata schemas used in preservation systems are different and it is difficult to judge the actual quality requirement of metadata migration. This paper presents a set of quality requirements for migration metadata and the necessity and sufficiency of these requirements are evaluated with a questionnaire that was distributed internationally and followed up by several telephone interviews. The survey results indicate that our requirements are complete and can be classified into three levels, namely essentiality, necessity, and conditionality. The proposed quality requirements can be used by custodians as a checklist to examine their metadata schemas in terms of how well they can support migration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

Most law school libraries that have already implemented an Institutional Repository (IR) chose proprietary platforms because they are easy to set up, customize, and maintain with the technical and development support they provide. The Texas Tech University School of Law Digital Repository is one of the few law school repositories in the nation that is built on the DSpace open source platform.1 The repository is the law school's first institutional repository in history. It was designed to collect, preserve, share and promote the law school's digital materials, including research and scholarship of the law faculty and students, institutional history, and law-related resources. In addition, the repository also serves as a dark archive to house internal records."
F. Zhao,2011,On choosing the digital document's file format for long-term preservation,"Digital libraries have been built all over the world. One of the main challenges in maintaining digital libraries is the digital preservation. The aim of digital preservation is to ensure that digital records are filed and are made available throughout time. Each digital library consists of different documents with different file formats. Due to rapid obsolescence in hardware and software technology it is necessary for the libraries to look into the details of the file formats. Thus the file format for long-term preservation plays a very important role during the practices of digital preservation. The article tries to analyzing the current situation of the file formats, then points out the standards in choosing the file format for long-term preservation based on generalizing the researches by scholars. After comparing the PDF and XML, the author thinks the XML file format is more suitable for long-term preservation. © 2011 IEEE."
G. Antunes; J. Barateiro; C. Becker; J. Borbinha; R. Vieira,2011,Modeling contextual concerns in enterprise architecture,"Enterprise Architecture approaches are used to provide rigorous descriptions of the organization-wide environment, manage the alignment of deployed services to the organization's mission, end ensure a clear separation of the concerns addressed in an architecture. Thus, an effective Enterprise Architecture approach assists in the management of relations and dependencies of any components of the organization environment and supports the integration and evolution of the architecture. However, the quality of that approach is strongly influenced by the precision of the architecture context description, a fact which is not always recognized. This paper focuses on the architecture context description and addresses the gap between the stakeholders' concerns and the resulting architecture. Based on a combination of established references and standards, we show how an explicit integration of the architecture context into the architecture model improves the linking of concerns and key elements of the architecture vision. We apply our approach to a subject of increasing concern in the Information Systems area: longevity of information. Digital preservation is an interdisciplinary problem, but existent initiatives address it in a very domain-centric way, making it impossible to integrate documented knowledge into an overall organization architecture. We analyze several references and models and derive a description of the architecture context and a capability model that supports incremental development through an explicit distinction between systems and their capabilities. The presented approach allows not just any organization to assess their current digital preservation awareness and evolve their architectures to address this challenge, but in particular demonstrates the added value of an explicit architecture context model in an Enterprise Architecture approach. © 2011 IEEE."

The need to work closely with information and communication technology (ICT) professionals is essential if digital preservation aspirations are to be realised. However, consideration has not been given to the challenges inherent in being respected or trusted by this occupational group. As a preliminary step to identifying possible cultural differences, a survey was developed to investigate the perceptions of ICT professionals as regards digital archives and the role of recordkeepers. Findings from this survey show differences in the perception of trustworthiness in terms of abilities to manage paper versus digital records. In addition, responses also highlight risks inherent in developing digital archives which do not take access requirements sufficiently into account. We suggest that attention must be paid to this dimension of custody if digital archives initiatives are to succeed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

H. Stancic; K. Pavlina; A.

They build a model for the long-term preservation of pharmaceutical records in the eCTD file format (electronic Common Technical Document -standard format for pharmaceutical documentation) stored in a digital archive. The model shows formation of archival information packages (AIPs) as structured, complex objects -based on eCTD's XML elements, packaged together with the appropriate metadata in a single object and protected for the preservation reasons by an integrated checksum creating MDx algorithm. An application based upon the developed model, upon initial mapping of eCTD's structure categories and metadata to the AIP's structure, is shown to be able to automate this process as much as possible. This procedure should enable users to use the application even for different types of complex digital objects, not only for eCTD. In that sense the application could become a generic 'preservation application' for the AIP creation and longterm preservation. The authors conclude that the developed model, exemplified by the eCTD documentation format and appurtenant application, could improve the AIP creation of pharmaceutical records intended for the long-term preservation in digital archives."
H. Suleman,2011,An African perspective on digital preservation,"The preservation of culture, language and history is recognised as being of crucial importance for future and current generations. Africa, especially, has the unique problem of needing to archive many collections of crucial significance to the world, yet without the skills or funds that often are utilised in this pursuit. The Bleek and Lloyd collection, that documents Bushman culture, and the DISA collection, that documents the South African liberation struggle, are examples of such projects. In both cases, and in other similar projects, there is a growing need for approaches to digital preservation, tools and techniques that better suit the needs and environment of developing countries. Some very specific solutions have emerged to solve problems related to Internet bandwidth and information accessibility, and these will be discussed, but these problems are only recently being acknowledged. Current digitisation efforts still outstrip efforts to organise information. Future technical solutions will therefore need to be found to maintain the pace of preservation as well as ensure ongoing access to all the peoples of the world. © 2011 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Most importantly, these systems have to ensure guaranteed availability over a long period of time, as well as integrity and authenticity of the preserved data and their metadata. This means that all kinds of technical problems need to be reliably handled and that the evolution of data formats is supported. At the same time, systems need to scale with the volume of data to be archived.

The result of the project was the Dioscorides Digital Library. Up to 2006, however, the pace of digitization was very slow, resulting in only 3,000 books and 50,000 digitized engravings. In September 2006, the Complutense University and Google signed a partnership agreement for the purpose of carrying out large-scale digitization of our public domain collections. The Complutense University Library is participating in this massdigitization project with the following goals: • To improve the discovery of the cultural heritage of Complutense and increase the number of potential readers; • To fulfil its public service mission; • To preserve and protect the original books; • To enhance students' and faculty research. By early 2011, the Complutense Library had digitized roughly 120,000 out-ofcopyright books from the 16th to the 19th centuries. All these materials are easily accessible via the Complutense Library Catalogue, Google Books and HathiTrust Digital Library. The Complutense University of Madrid joined the HathiTrust Digital Library in November 2010, which allowed books digitized by Google to be stored on HathiTrust servers. The HathiTrust Digital Library is both a digital preservation repository and a platform for access. It provides long-term preservation and access services for public domain and in-copyright content from a variety of sources, including Google, the Internet Archive, Microsoft, and in-house partner institution initiatives. In early 2011, the number of HathiTrust public domain volumes reached the two million mark and the collection exceeded eight million volumes. In addition, and complementing the above, the digital content of the Complutense University Library will be aggregated to Europeana during 2011 and 2012."

To ensure safe storage and long-term preservation, standards for metadata are needed. This paper proposes a metadata application profile for cloud archives. We use guidelines from the Singapore Framework for Dublin Core Application Profiles to define the functional requirements, domain model and description set profile that form the basis of the proposed application profile. In our profile, we use METS as a transmission and package format, extending it with metadata from the PREMIS data dictionary and Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. Using the proposed application profile, we create an example METS information package using predefined criteria. We find that the profile meets the functional requirements, and that it simplifies metadata provision for business systems, compared to systems that do not allow pre-registration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

In this paper we raise a new perspective to address digital preservation as a long-term information security problem ideally addressed in the origin by the initial information system that has created or makes direct use of the objects where, in some scenario, they can be better protected against several threats that can affect their future interpretation and reuse. In order to achieve this goal, we suggest the use of Risk Management processes in collaboration with Enterprise Architecture processes.

J. Brunsmann,2011,Product lifecycle metadata harmonization with the future in OAIS archives,"Metadata plays a crucial role in supporting the discovery, understanding and management of the large product data collections generated throughout all phases of the product lifecycle. Product data models are annotated with metadata which represent meaning in conformance with evolving metadata schemas while, for business, contractual and legal reasons, these semantically enriched models are ingested into OAIS (Open Archival Information System) based archives for later reuse. Notably, it is not uncommon for a product service provider to operate products for several decades; even after the engineers whose embodied knowledge supports their operation retire or leave the company. This product longevity and volatile knowledge, alongside rapid technological innovations and evolving metadata schemas, require that special preservation processes be used to keep the archived product data and metadata interpretable. While preservation of the data is concerned with product data model normalization, validation and file format migration, the preservation processes for metadata are of a different nature given that referenced schemas evolve independently from the products they describe. Although widely referenced, the OAIS reference model unfortunately does not observe metadata schema versioning or metadata harmonization in any depth. This paper therefore aims to introduce dedicated metadata preservation functionality into OAIS archives, based on operational schema update processing."
J. Brunsmann,2011,Semantic exploration of archived product lifecycle metadata under schema and instance evolution,"The product lifecycle spans from idea generation, design, manufacturing and service to disposal. During all these phases, engineers use their tacit knowledge to fulfill their tasks. If engineers retire or leave a company, their embodied knowledge also resigns. To circumvent such loss of important company's intellectual property, the engineer's knowledge is captured as linked data and then used as annotation for product lifecycle data models. To enable the reuse of data not only in the near-term, the product data and its annotated metadata are ingested into special long-term archives. However, achieving full preservation of semantically enriched product data requires the consideration of the linked data lifecycle which includes the evolution of schemas and instances. Such conceptualization and terminology changes pose the threat of semantic obsolescence of archived product data. Therefore, this paper describes dedicated metadata preservation functionality which respects knowledge evolution of the linked data lifecycle."
J. E. Baek; S. Sugimoto,2011,"Facet analysis of archival metadata standards to support appropriate selection, combination and use of metadata schemas","Metadata is one of the keys for digital archiving and preservation. This is well recognized as an important issue in our networked information society. There are several standards for archival and preservation metadata, e.g. ISAD(G), EAD, AGRkMS, PREMIS, and OAIS. This leads to selection and interoperability issues for metadata standards in the design of metadata schemas for particular archival systems. This paper identifies features of metadata standards to appropriately select, combine and use them in the resource lifecycle. We present a feature analysis of the metadata standards by identifying the primary resource lifecycle stage(s) where a standard would be applied. Based on this feature analysis, this paper proposes a framework to help selection, combination and use of metadata schemas for digital archiving and preservation. Then, we propose to categorize metadata elements using 5W1H attributes - What, Why, Where, Who, When and How - coupled with a task model derived from the resource lifecycle. In this study, metadata elements of the chosen standards are categorized using the 5W1H attributes and mapped to each other. The mappings are grouped and sorted in accordance with the task model. The 5W1H and task models are applied to six element sets chosen from major metadata standards. Thus, the proposed models help us identify contexts of descriptive elements and define crosswalks among standards."

J. E. LaBarca,2011,Preservation of documents and photographic images: Long term strategies for future generations,"Upon discovering the unfamiliar object in their grandparents' attic, most people today would be hard-pressed to play back a recording made on a wax cylinder of the late 1800s. What will people do just 50 years from now with an optical disk or magnetic hard drive? Over time, we have recorded our memories in many ways: letters, post cards, photographs, movies, audio and video recordings are a few examples. In earlier days, interpreting those non-time-sequenced (still"") recordings was independent of the technology used to create them - you could hold and view a hard copy document in your hand. But even in those early days, time-sequenced recordings depended on the technology used to create them to render them back into a usable form. Our success in dealing with technology changes and rendering early recordings for the masses has been mixed at best. Hard copy documents and images, however, were never an issue until recent times. How will future generations deal with those post cards, letters to the family, and photographs that have now been replaced by ""Word documents"", email, and digital images on the computer? Consumers need to become aware of long-term storage and preservation issues that relate to the preservation of the data behind digital documents including photographic images, letters, etc. The more obvious issues, such as accidental or catastrophic data loss and hardware format evolution, have been recognized by the archiving community. Consumers need to be alerted to these issues and be prepared to develop preservation strategies as well. However, longer-term issues beyond routine backup and migration of data also need to be considered. The basic solution of preservation via human-readable hardcopy documents and images is one option, but this raises a fundamental question regarding image preservation that transcends even the more complex solutions - the long-term stability of the chosen media, whether digital or analog. This paper provides an update on preservation strategies for the consumer. While the familiar advice to ""make a hard copy"" provides a solid foundation, we go beyond this recommendation, with the intent to raise awareness of the need to create a long-term preservation plan for documents and images, and the data behind them. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""

The result of this work is the Repository eXchange Package (RXP), a lightweight packaging format that uses the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) schema to encode the RXP structure and the Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS) schema to encode digital provenance. The RXP can accommodate heterogeneous AIP structures and can be easily generated and ingested by heterogeneous preservation environments while maintaining an unbroken chain of digital provenance. These attributes make the RXP useful in a variety of preservation contexts: succession, disaster recovery, software migration, diversification, and specialized content processing. The TIPR project and the RXP format have been described in papers delivered at iPRES 2009 and 2010, DLF Spring 2009, and the NIST US Digital Preservation Interoperability Framework Workshop. This paper focuses on how the RXP can be used in each of the different contexts listed above, describes potential issues for each scenario, and recommends best practices for creating, interpreting and ingesting RXP packages. It also explores limitations of the RXP and modifications that have been suggested by other parties. Finally, it outlines decisions that transfer partners must negotiate in order to support successful exchange of content between repositories."

J. van der Knijff,2011,JPEG 2000 for long-term preservation: JP2 as a preservation format,"Despite the increasing popularity of JPEG 2000 in the archival community, the suitability of the JP2 format for long-term preservation has been poorly addressed by existing literature. This paper demonstrates how some parts of the JP2 file specification (related to ICC profiles and grid resolution) contain ambiguous information, leading to a situation where different software vendors are interpreting the standard in slightly different ways. This results in a number of risks for preservation. These risks could be reduced by applying some minor changes to the format specification, in combination with the adherence to the updated standard by software vendors. © 2011 Johan van der Knijff."

J. Yang; T. Sugibuchi; N. Spyratos,2011,Taxonomy based notification service for the ASSETS digital library platform,"In this paper, we report our taxonomy-based notification service for the ASSETS digital library platform, which is being developed in an EU co-funded project. Notification is a very fundamental functionality for every living digital library which is continuously updated and dynamically interacts with users. The ASSETS platform provides a common notification service and its extensions based on the publish/subscribe pattern as a message notification infrastructure. Our taxonomy based notification service is one of those extensions that enables users to define subscriptions for receiving notifications by using a hierarchically organized controlled vocabulary, namely a taxonomy. Through this service, users can easily subscribe to messages about specific domain of their interest with a small number of terms in a taxonomy. Then system can efficiently filter a stream of published messages to deliver notifications to proper subscribers by taking account of the taxonomy. This service works as an important piece for enabling various advanced features in the ASSETS platform such as personalized new item lists and a digital preservation service. In this paper, we show an outline of the ASSETS notification architecture, and give a description about a model for the taxonomy-based notification implemented in our service. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

K. Qian; M. Schott; C. Kraetzer; M. Hemmje; Acm,2011,Contextualizing Security for Digital Long-term Preservation,"Nowadays a growing amount of information not only exists in digital form but was actually born-digital. Digital long-term preservation becomes continuously important and is tackled by several international and national projects like the US National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program(1) or the EU FP7 SHAMAN Integrated Project(2). The very essence of long-term preservation is the preserved data, which in turn requires an appropriate security model, which is so far often neglected in the preservation community. To address this problem, we extend the security relevant parts of the Open Archival Information System (OATS) standard by a concept for hierarchical security policy development based on given use-cases for a long-term archival system. The corresponding policies are then distributed and implemented by applying an iterative procedure to turn them to rules, and then the rules are enforced. In this paper we describe how to construct a corresponding context model and derive such policies using an iterative approach to assure the system and data security."

The main focus is in digital archive services, but also in later phase of the project physical archive services are provided. Digital archive services are provided by using SaaS model (Software as a Service), so any investments by customers are needed. We hope that through the project organizations understanding about the role of archiving function in organizations information management increases. Digital archiving services creates wide possibilities e.g. for developing eServices for citizens. First services produced are Terminal Archive Services and after that project continues developing Active Archive Services. Integrations in client systems used by municipalities are made continuously through the service life cycle, and these integrations are commercialized as separate products. Service contracts are made between service provider and customer. Contract includes service descriptions, responsibilities for both parties and service levels. Support services are also described. Business model enables providing archive services to those organizations in municipality sector, which are customer-owners of service provider, i.e. own shares of the provider company."
K. Woods; C. A. Lee; S.

Widely used today by practitioners of digital forensics, disk images can serve as baselines for comparison for digital preservation activities, as they provide fail-safe mechanisms when curatorial actions make unexpected changes to data; enable access to potentially valuable data that resides below the file system level; and provide options for future analysis. We discuss established digital forensics techniques for acquiring, preserving and annotating disk images, provide examples from both research and educational collections, and describe specific forensic tools and techniques, including an object-oriented data packaging framework called the Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) and the Digital Forensics XML (DFXML) metadata representation. © 2011 ACM."
L. A. Horelick; E. Pearlstein; H. R. Larson,2011,Seeing versus saving: Recommendations for calculating research use - Lighting for library special collections,"The research presented in this paper describes the measurement of light and ultraviolet energy within a special collections facility, with the goal of evaluating whether levels recommended for museums and archival collections are being exceeded during research usage. An Elsec 764 hand-held light meter was used to record the light intensity falling on collection material held within and without V-shaped book mounts and with sequential lights turned on, as occurs in collections' use. The authors developed a simple algebraic formula to calculate cumulative doses of light and incident ultraviolet radiation to determine how many hours collection material could be accessed and illuminated before damage could be expected. The authors calculated the maximum cumulative doses possible based on numbers of access hours and compared these to recommended doses for sensitive media as a monitoring strategy for the long-term preservation of light sensitive special collection materials. The results from this study suggest that the light levels evaluated are not in excess of recommended values and that the use of book mounts reduces the amount of light falling on collection material. Monitoring actions are recommended for institutions wishing to replicate the study."

Gallo,2011,Towards a contract expression language for audiovisual content,"Different initiatives have been started in the last years to achieve long term digital preservation of audiovisual content. This process also implies the preservation of the associated metadata, digital rights, etc. The adoption of standard solutions is essential to enable interoperability in a preservation framework. The narrative contracts dealing with the audiovisual content written in natural language can be digitally represented following two different approaches. The former constrains the definition of the contracts to a specific rights model, while the latter derives a usable model from the analysis of a relevant contract sample set. Following the second approach, this paper proposes a model, which faithfully represents audiovisual contracts, resultant from the extension of the MPEG-21 Media Value Chain Ontology standard."
L. Duranti; A. Jansen; W. Castelnovo; E. Ferrari,2011,Authenticity of Digital Records: An Archival Diplomatics Framework for Digital Forensics,"The field of forensic analysis of digital records is undergoing a rapid maturation process in order to maintain pace with the change of technology. The evolving best practices in digital forensic investigation that concern collection, handling, examination and presentation of evidence are predominantly practitioner driven, with little research directed towards the issues surrounding the maintenance and long term preservation of the authenticity of the evidence collected. Yet, the authenticity of such evidence is essential to the judicial process for, without authentic evidence, determination of guilt or innocence cannot be certain. As evidence is increasingly in digital form, higher standards of conduct are demanded of those examining and preserving it. An interdisciplinary approach to the digital forensic processes involving the use of archival diplomatics can assist forensic experts in the determination of the authenticity of digital evidence that has the nature of records, as well as the identification of key attributes that must be preserved over the long term to demonstrate and maintain the records continuing authenticity. The scientific rigor of archival diplomatics would allow forensic experts and the custodians of collected evidence to demonstrate, over the long term and through system and technical migrations, the continuing authenticity of both the records they have collected from a crime scene as evidence and the records they have produced during the examination, submission and maintenance of such evidence. Through an overview of a research project carried out at the University of British Columbia, this paper discusses how the concepts of archival diplomatics, digital forensics and the law of evidence can be integrated to form the theoretical framework of the new discipline of Digital Records Forensics."
L. LaPlant; B. Edwards; P. Nelson,2011,Automated metadata creation to enhance search capabilities in GPO's Federal Digital System,"GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys) automates the collection and dissemination of electronic information from all three branches of the United States federal government. Information is submitted directly into FDsys, permanently available in electronic format, authenticated and versioned, and publicly accessible for searching and downloading. FDsys relies on three key system components to accomplish this: 1) A content management system that securely manages digital content to safeguard content integrity and authenticity, 2) A preservation repository that follows archival system standards to ensure long-term preservation and access to digital content, and 3) An advanced search engine combines extensive metadata with modern search technology, allowing the public to find federal government publications. FDsys is a metadata driven system. It has been developed to utilize multiple metadata creation techniques, including parsing from unstructured or semi-structured text, transformations from structured formats, transformations to apply constants, and manual metadata entry. Using these techniques, GPO is able to create and store metadata to power the search engine on the FDsys.gov web site. This metadata is used to deliver advanced search, field operator search, search result filters (aka faceted navigation), and hierarchical browsing of documents. It is also used to provide downloads of descriptive metadata files in MODS XML. This emphasis on source metadata makes FDsys a dynamic, rich, flexible, powerful, and transparent system for document search and access. This paper will discuss different methods used to create metadata, how FDsys descriptive metadata is stored, and how this metadata is utilized by the FDsys search engine. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

M. Conway; R. Moore; A. Rajasekar; J. Y. Nief,2011,Demonstration of policy-guided data preservation using iRODS,"Policy-oriented data management is an emerging field that provides automation of large collection management using policies encoded as machine-executable rules. Digital archives provide long term preservation of collections that can span decades across multiple technology refreshes. Policy-based data management is critical for digital archives because of the need to maintain integrity across long spans of time. The management of preservation policies for large collections can be an onerous task. Typical policies may control ingest of records, extraction of required provenance information, replication of records, retention and disposition, and validation of assessment criteria. The iRODS (the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) is an exemplar that provides distributed data management under a policy-oriented framework that can be applied to long-term data archiving. We will present a demonstration of the preservation environment, including the composition of preservation policies and automated enforcement of policies. A user interface framework will be demonstrated that manages ingest of records into a staging area, automates application of preservation policies, and tracks status of the processing steps. © 2011 IEEE."
M. Evans; B. Steel; R. Sharpe; J. Carr; A. Gairey; J. Tilbury,2011,A community driven micro-services architecture supporting long term digital preservation,"This paper describes a digital preservation platform that has been developed over a seven year period in partnership with several national memory institutions. The platform provides a viable solution to the challenges of long term digital preservation by delivering a flexible, extensible set of micro-services that are orchestrated into processes to provide capabilities around ingest, storage, data management, preservation and access. The use of micro-services allows a policy neutral approach, allowing policy decisions to be changed without the need to modify the underlying architecture. In addition it allows them to become open source, which enables and encourages a community solution to commonly faced issues. The platform, known as the Safety Deposit Box (SDB), has been built from the ground up to be compliant with the OAIS reference model from a functional and informational standpoint. This paper describes the main architectural concepts that are employed in the platform, in particular the flexible and extensible frameworks that allow functionality to be encapsulated in user or community provided micro-services and workflows. An emphasis will be placed on the set of services that provide tools for guarding against the challenge of file format obsolescence, which include characterization, preservation planning and preservation action. Since a micro-services approach has been adopted the system can evolve over time; new functions can be added and, existing functions can be enhanced. This is particularly important as services within the digital preservation domain are in their infancy. Format migration and emulation have been adopted as the primary long-term preservation mechanisms and an approach to validating such pathways is described. The use of micro services allows existing best-of-breed tools to be incorporated into the solution.. It has been configured to incorporate the DROID and JHOVE tools as well as other commonly-used open-source and commercially provided characterization and migration tools. The paper includes a description of a community driven approach which includes the sharing of collective knowledge and experience the encouragement for the exchange of micro service and workflow, and the ability for the community to significantly influence the future road map of functionality."

The results developed within the Estrella project and the integration with other national and international standards envisage the possibility to use CEN Metalex as a neutral document standard in many situations where legal information resources are involved: as intermediate data format for fostering long term preservation of legal documents, as a tool for interoperability between legacy systems, as an interchange data format between different application layers, as a conversion mechanism across versions of the same standard. CEN Metalex permits also to build interesting applications of CMS for heterogeneous legal resource information. For exploiting these potentialities CEN Metalex needs to be enriched with a legal document ontology and moreover to an intermediate layer called LMIF for adding semantic to the general structural layer. This work presents how to foster CEN Metalex using LMIF and how to connect this layer with an abstract legal document ontology. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

However, relatively few repositories have implemented practical action plans towards permanence. Repository managers often lack time and confidence to tackle the important but scary problem of preservation. Written by, and aimed at, institutional repository managers, this paper describes how the JISC-funded KeepIt project has been bringing together existing preservation tools and services with appropriate training and advice to enable repository managers to formulate practical and achievable preservation plans. Three elements of the KeepIt project are described: 1. The initial, exploratory phase in which repository managers and a preservation specialist established the current status of each repository and its preservation objectives; 2. The repository-specific KeepIt preservation training course which covered the organisational and financial framework of repository preservation; metadata; the new preservation tools; and issues of trust between repository, users and services; 3. The application of some of the tools and lessons learned from the training course to four exemplar repositories and the impact that this has made. The paper concludes by recommending practical steps that all repository managers may take to ensure their repositories are preservation-ready."
M.

This is explored in relation to the Viable System Model (VSM) with accompanying theories, and builds on empirical material from a Swedish governmental authority. The VSM is used to reach understandings of the authority's situation, with focus on the VSM theories around responsibility and cooperation. I have found that digital preservation work is facilitated e.g. when one department deals with one preservation process (collect, preserve or make accessible), personnel have a holistic perspective on the authority and communication and coordination channels are established. I additionally have found that the VSM focus on processes and functions is advantageous since this clarifies what is actually done, as well as who among personnel is doing what. In turn, this helps to clarify who should be responsible for what, and also where cooperation is essential. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
M. Seadle,2011,Archiving in the networked world: Metrics for testing,"Purpose: This paper aims to focus on how long-term digital archiving systems are tested and what benchmarks and other metrics are necessary for that testing to produce data that the community can use to make decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The article reviews recent literature about digital archiving systems involving public and semi-public tests. It then looks specifically at the rules and metrics needed for doing public or semi-public testing for three specific issues: triggering migration; ingest rates; and storage capacity measurement. Findings: Important literature on testing exists but common metrics do not, and too few data are available at this point to establish them reliably. Metrics are needed to judge the quality and timeliness of an archive's migration services. Archives should offer benchmarks for the speed of ingest, but that will happen only once they come to agreement about starting and ending points. Storage capacity is another area where librarians are raising questions, but without proxy measures and agreement about data amounts, such testing cannot proceed. Practical implications: Testing is necessary to develop useful metrics and benchmarks about performance. At present the archiving community has too little data on which to make decisions about long term digital archiving, and as long as that is the case, the decisions may well be flawed. Originality/value: The article shows that testing is key to making rational decisions about digital long term archiving systems but establishing metrics and rules by which librarians can compare the results is far from easy. © ."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses publicly available online data, which are processed in a set of PERL programs to measure the number of DOAJ articles in the three archiving systems. Findings: The findings show that only 8 per cent of the DOAJ titles are in LOCKSS/CLOCKSS and only 5 per cent in Portico. The findings also suggest that it could take eight years to archive all full text DOAJ articles in e-Depot based on current plans.

The cultural assets were digitally preserved in a post-construction and modified form as an attempt to fulfill the life-cycle management of data for culture workers, researchers and architects. The scan process was managed in four hierarchies: the whole region, the seven historical buildings, the four streets and the special features, in different scales. The final digital model integrates research results from all involved parties, integrates local practice needs, represents hypothesis in city development, enhances historical understanding and interpretation, and facilitates remote access. © 2011."
N. Krebs; S. Rönnau; U. M. Borghoff,2011,Fostering the universal virtual computer as long-term preservation platform,"The Universal Virtual Computer (UVC) is a simple yet powerful approach to preserve digital objects on a long-term scale. The main idea is to develop tools for the UVC to access encoded objects, thus preserving the accessibility of the digital object. Consisting of only few commands, the UVC allows for an arbitrary amount of segments, registers, and memory. The specification is provided in plain English to allow for a simple implementation of the UVC. Currently, the UVC is only available as proof-of-concept. We gained practical experiences by implementening the UVC on different platforms, as well as by developing tools on top of the UVC. In this paper, we present these experiences which have led to an improved specification of the UVC. In this way, an even simpler implementation of this powerful and comparatively cheap archiving approach becomes possible. © 2011 IEEE."
P. Bryan Heidorn,2011,The emerging role of libraries in data curation and e-science,"The role of libraries is to collect, preserve, and disseminate the intellectual output of the society. This output includes books and serials as well as the digital versions of the same. Scientists, other scholars, and all of society are now producing, storing, and disseminating digital data that underpin the aforementioned documents in much larger volumes than the text. The survival of this data is in question since the data are not housed in long-lived institutions such as libraries. This situation threatens the underlying principles of scientific replicability since in many cases data cannot readily be collected again. Libraries are the institutions that could best manage this intellectual output. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Now with several years of operational experience behind them, some of these institutions are implementing second generation"" repository systems designed to take advantage of lessons learned. This spring the Florida Digital Archive is implementing DAITSS 2, a completely rewritten version of its original DATTSS system. Functionally, DAITSS 2 does not differ greatly from DALTSS, but technically and architecturally there are many changes. Migration to the new system is complicated by the fact that the Florida Digital Archive manages multiple copies of an archival store containing upwards of 30 million files. This paper describes major differences between the two systems, issues in migrating from one to the other, and the final migration plan. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""
P. Conway,2011,Archival quality and long-term preservation: A research framework for validating the usefulness of digital surrogates,"Digital archives accept and preserve digital content for long-term use. Increasingly, stakeholders are creating large-scale digital repositories to ingest surrogates of archival resources or digitized books whose intellectual value as surrogates may exceed that of the original sources themselves. Although digital repository developers have expended significant effort to establish the trustworthiness of repository procedures and infrastructures, relatively little attention has been paid to the quality and usefulness of the preserved content itself. In situations where digital content has been created by third-party firms, content quality (or its absence in the form of unacceptable error) may directly influence repository trustworthiness. This article establishes a conceptual foundation for the association of archival quality and information quality research. It outlines a research project that is designed to develop and test measures of quality for digital content preserved in HathiTrust, a large-scale preservation repository. The research establishes methods of measuring error in digitized books at the data, page, and volume level and applies the measures to statistically valid samples of digitized books, adjusting for inter-coder inconsistencies and the effects of sampling strategies. The research findings are then validated with users who conform to one of four use-case scenarios: reading online, printing on demand, data mining, and print collection management. The paper concludes with comments on the implications of assessing archival quality within a digital preservation context. © 2011 The Author(s)."
P. Doorenbosch; B. Sierman,2011,"Institutional repositories, long term preservation and the changing nature of scholarly publications","The web offers new opportunities for scholars to publish the outcome of their research. One of these new forms is called Enhanced Publications. In an Enhanced Publication different objects and files that has a meaningful and close relation to each other are aggregated on the level of a resource map in witch not only the separate files are described, but also the relation between those files are. An example of an Enhanced Publication is a digital text publication and a dataset on which the publication is based. Preserving these compound entities in the existing infrastructures raises new issues.

P. Galloway,2011,"Educating for digital archiving through studio pedagogy, sequential case studies, and reflective practice","Since 2001 the author has been teaching a graduate course in digital archiving at the School of Information, University of Texas at Austin, as part of a suite of courses on digital archives and recordkeeping, embedded in larger programs of archival studies and preservation studies. This essay outlines the development of this course over time in order to describe the emergence of an approach to digital archiving teaching through active and reflective digital archiving practice, in the context of a laboratory environment including a functional digital repository. There are three major aspects to this approach: 1) a pedagogical method to support students in active learning through carrying out real archiving projects (reflective practice in a mixed-skills team setting); 2) a practice aimed at providing experience in testing, developing, and improving preservation methods over time in the context of a working repository (sequential case studies); and 3) a means for understanding and accounting for the evolution of the preservation infrastructure itself over time (the seed/evolve/reseed model). Finally, major elements of course content include the history of both computing and preservation research, methods and resources for researching technology, and methods for assuring the long-term preservation of authentic digital objects."

Smith Ii,2011,"Developing small worlds of e-science: Using quantum mechanics, biological science, and oceanography for education and outreach strategies for engaging research communities within a University","The paper provides an introductory and exploratory research method for developing a data management plan strategy through the experimental approach of developing and preserving small worlds of e-science of grey literature from the physics, biological, and oceanographic research disciplines at Florida State University. The paper opted for an experimental approach of digitization, cataloging, and resource discovery in a digital content management system (DigiTool), online public access catalog (OPAC) in Aleph and OCLC WorldCat, and preservation in Florida Digital Archive (FDA), and MetaArchive while introducing connections to information science, organization, and information system theories for the development of digital curation theory through the theory building strategy of Metatriangulation. The paper provides descriptive research insight into exploring the application of information science theories, organizational theory concepts, and information systems models to the emerging field of digital curation in the development of a data management plan that includes defining digital curation, data curation, and digital preservation. Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalisability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to further develop research. The paper aims to contribute to the body of knowledge of digital curation through OAIS Reference Model, The DCC Curation Lifecycle Model, and Data Management Model digital curation theory building through the theory building strategy of Metatriangulation. Originality/value - This paper fulfills an identified need to study how digital curation theory building via Metatriangulation can be enabled and mapped to Boyer's Model of Scholarship."
P. Sestoft,2011,Organizing research data,"Research relies on ever larger amounts of data from experiments, automated production equipment, questionnaries, times series such as weather records, and so on. A major task in science is to combine, process and analyse such data to obtain evidence of patterns and correlations.Most research data are on digital form, which in principle ensures easy processing and analysis, easy long-term preservation, and easy reuse in future research, perhaps in entirely unanticipated ways. However, in practice, obstacles such as incompatible or undocumented data formats, poor data quality and lack of familiarity with current technology prevent researchers from making full use of available data.This paper argues that relational databases are excellent tools for veterinary research and animal production; provides a small example to introduce basic database concepts; and points out some concerns that must be addressed when organizing data for research purposes."
P. Siitonen; M. Loponen; O. Palonen,2011,IT professionals and archivists need common studies in digital archiving,"In this paper, we introduce two new educational programs Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences (MUAS) started in 2005-2008. The target for both programs is to give knowledge and skills on one hand in the Records Management and Digital Archiving and other hand in the Information Technology. Digital contents, electronic records management and digital archiving have been a revolution in RM and archiving since 90's and it has been clear that skills and methods from the paper world will not be enough for the archivist and records manager of today. To get an understanding in our development there is a need to make introduction to the Finnish educational system, a special view concerning our education of RM and archiving and our background as R&D organization in the Mikkeli district. The records management education has not been very covering in the higher education institutes in Finland, actually the first assistant professor chair and courses for records management were started in the University of Tampere in the late 1990's as an addition to the educational programs for librarians and information specialists. Traditionally the National Archives Service has trained their own staff: young historians have been employed as trainees and trained internally. Other public sector operations, like 400 municipalities - cities, towns and rural districts - have got their archivists with practices of similar kind. In the recent years there have been some new master programs in other science universities, but they have been based more on history than information science. MUAS programme is still the only one based on Information Technology. ©2011 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

Darányi,2011,XML processing in the cloud: Large-scale digital preservation in small institutions,"Digital preservation deals with the problem of retaining the meaning of digital information over time to ensure its accessibility. The process often involves a workflow which transforms the digital objects. The workflow defines document pipelines containing transformations and validation checkpoints, either to facilitate migration for persistent archival or to extract metadata. The transformations, nevertheless, are computationally expensive, and therefore digital preservation can be out of reach for an organization whose core operation is not in data conservation. The operations described the document workflow, however, do not frequently reoccur. This paper combines an implementation-independent workflow designer with cloud computing to support small institution in their ad-hoc peak computing needs that stem from their efforts in digital preservation. © 2011 IEEE."
Q. L. Nguyen; A. Lake,2011,Content server system architecture for providing differentiated levels of service in a Digital Preservation Cloud,"The growing use of digital records in organizations creates a challenge of preservation and archival of these records. The entities dealing with the care and keeping of digital records include governmental organizations at the local and national level that must retain evidence of policy and administration, history-oriented institutions that keep cultural heritage for posterity, financial, medical, legal and plethora of other organizations and businesses. Archiving and preserving digital records requires IT infrastructure and personnel to run the infrastructure. Recently, Cloud Computing has gained momentum in the IT world as one of the options for dealing with the challenges of electronic record management, thanks to the maturity of network protocol infrastructure, virtualization technology and a price-based Service Level Agreement structure. This paper discusses the characteristics and challenges of long term digital preservation that motivate the concept of a specialized Digital Preservation Cloud Service. In response to these challenges, a scalable and evolvable Content Server System Architecture is proposed here, which can constitute the core of a Digital Preservation Cloud. The proposed architecture with its SOA paradigm, layers, and open interfaces will be capable of servicing different levels of service requirements for long term archiving, preservation, search, and access."

R. Devarakonda; G. Palanisamy; J. M. Green; B. E. Wilson,2011,Data sharing and retrieval using OAI-PMH,"There is a growing consensus for the need to store and archive digital data, particularly for publicly funded research. Long-term preservation of that data generally requires some form of institutional archive, such as those directed to particular scientific communities of practice. Given that data is often of use to multiple communities of practice, which may have differing norms for data and metadata structure and semantics, effective standards for data and metadata exchange are important factors for users to be able to find and retrieve data. Toolsets that provide a coherent presentation of information across multiple standards are important for data search and access. One such toolset, Mercury, is a open-source metadata harvesting, data discovery, and access system, built for researchers to search for, share and obtain spatiotemporal data used across a range of climate and ecological sciences. Mercury is used across multiple projects to provide a coherent search interface for spatiotemporal data described in any of several metadata formats. Mercury has recently been extended to enable harvesting and distribution of metadata using the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Handling (OAI-PMH). In this paper we describe Mercury's capabilities with multiple metadata formats, in general, and, more specifically, the results of our OAI-PMH implementations and the lessons learned."
R. Fox,2011,Forensics of digital librarianship,"Purpose: This paper seeks to examine important issues relating to digital preservation with a focus on file integrity and digital forensics. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper. Findings: This paper highlights important issues relating to digital preservation and offers suggestions on comprehensive approaches to achieving a high level of integrity with library digital repositories. Practical implications: Libraries have always had as a part of their core mission the preservation of information and cultural heritage. The seriousness with which the challenges associated with digital preservation are met will determine the reputation of libraries as continuing to be a reliable preserver of cultural heritage and research data. Social implications: Libraries play an important role in cultural heritage and preservation of research data. This role is manifested both generally and specifically within the academic context. It is important that libraries stay at the forefront of developing reliable means for digital preservation. Originality/value: Several means of achieving a high degree of reliability in the area of digital preservation are suggested.

R. Groenewald; A. Breytenbach,2011,The use of metadata and preservation methods for continuous access to digital data,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the awareness about digital preservation and what must be done towards preserving valuable original digital material. The paper also aims to discuss the use of metadata principles and the implementation of tools for the preservation of documents stored on personal computers. Design/methodology/approach - Data loss prevention starts with the creation of a digital object. However, methods to minimize the loss of digital data are often ignored, the use of metadata structures embedded in digital objects from the outset thereof are recommended as a starting point towards good preservation principles. The need to create awareness on the issue of digital preservation was promoted by the authors at various occasions during 2008, as the number of incidents of data loss and costs involved continue to be of concern to all involved. Whether the loss occurs by a malicious attempt, or an inadvertent mistake, it can be diminishing either personally or to the institute/company where it occurs. Data were collected through a digital questionnaire and literature studies were done on several strategies, policies and best practices. Personal visits to libraries actively working on digital preservation and curation formed a basis for conducting the study. The implementation of tools that can be used to preserve and retrieve digital content by individuals was also investigated. Findings - Digital objects should be archived with metadata about the object and the creation thereof. Metadata need not necessarily be structured and controlled when used by individuals or small groups for preservation of self owned data. The metadata content, however, should describe the object, the method of creation and technologies used in the creation. All changes to the document should be captured in the preservation metadata. Future access to digital content does not only depend on one preservation method but on a sequence of strategies and methods applied to the digital content. Originality/value - The paper provides a broad overview of certain aspects that must be considered when implementing digital preservation strategies. The value of metadata needs to be widely accepted and implemented and the use thereof promoted to creators of personal digital objects. © ."
R. Hisham; M. F. Hamzah,2011,"PRESERVING LOCAL RESEARCH ARTICLES TO CREATE VISIBILITY AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING AMONG RESEARCHERS AND STUDENTS WORLDWIDE: UNIVERSITY OF MALAYA INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY""""","Now, more than ever, the way information is stored, retrieved and displayed is changing. The availability of printed materials can be retrieved in digitized format to support knowledge sharing among researchers and students. Indeed, many universities especially Research Universities in Malaysia are heading towards implementing digital content in their organizations. Digital repositories are also one of the initiatives taken by academic libraries in Research Universities to transform towards digital library. Preserving records, mainly the research article is a vital approach as a visibility of researchers and to be in par with the initiatives from other higher ranking universities in the world. This paper describes the initial project done by University of Malaya Library in preserving local research articles throughout the world in a way to promote open access which act as digital archive. University of Malaya Institutional repository is an open access digital archive containing the details of published and unpublished research work produced by the University of Malaya staff and researchers. In supporting this project, University of Malaya Library chose E-Prints as a tool to embark this initiative in par of being an established Research University in Malaysia. It preserves the publish papers, research journal articles, unpublished pre-prints together with working papers, technical reports, book chapters and conference proceedings and etc. This paper also describes the process of digital initiative being done to contribute to the creation of digital records in open access platform. As University of Malaya research repository has self-archiving capabilities, everyone is encouraged to deposit their own papers or articles. E-Prints would be a dependable platform in preserving all the electronic records which has been under the right of University of Malaya. The concept of selectivity in preserving electronic records is very important. Access to electronic records is dependent on the constantly changing and evolving computer technology. Unlike paper records that can survive for hundreds of years unless measures are taken to destroy them, electronic records do not persist unless deliberate steps are taken to preserve them. The importance of preserving the electronic records will be clarified by implementing the trusted digital repository. In conclusion, digital repositories such as E-Prints sustain the creation of visibility among researchers and students around the world. There is no limited access to the data and enables researchers to communicate and set up the networking among them for profession development."
R. N. Westbrook; M. Reilly,2011,Growing a mutually-beneficial digital curation internship program that is sustainable and low cost,"Digital curation is a fast-growing subfield of librarianship and archival management. The number of calls for digital curation positions that often require advanced knowledge of multimedia digitization practices, metadata standards, digital asset management systems and project management strategies has increased significantly over the past few years. Yet, Library and Information Science (LIS) programs rarely prepare students adequately in these disciplines. Meanwhile, digital departments are expected to sustain and grow digital collections in the face of system-wide budget reductions. Many departments are operating with fewer staff and resources than ever before. The Digital Services Department at the University of Houston Libraries (UHDS) is one such department. In response, the UHDS Internship Program was designed to provide a comprehensive digital curation experience for library school students while providing the UHDS Department with a steady, low-cost base of intern workers. This paper outlines in detail the steps taken to establish a mutually-beneficial digital curation internship program including motivations behind the decisions, results and lessons learned."

R. Weerakkody,2011,Multiple sub stream error resilient video coding for audio visual archiving applications,"This paper presents a novel and efficient approach to error resilient video coding, targeted at audio visual archiving applications, where video files need to be kept in digital storage systems for extended periods of time. In the face of the inevitable data corruptions occurring silently in the storage media, the proposed method enables graceful degradation while also minimising the total cost of storage. Rather than keeping the video stream as a single continuous file within the storage system, it is proposed to split it intelligently into multiple sub files, with selective replication, based on a significance index defined for the various components of the encoded bit stream, and the characteristics of the storage system itself. The sub files are stored in different tiers of a multi-tier digital storage system with graded"" protection. A sliding scale is defined to vary the mapping of the significance index to the coding parameters. The parameters could be optimised for the application specific circumstances, including the desired quality and the longevity of the content."""
R. Wright,2011,Issues of scale and storage in digital preservation,"The reliability of the computer systems that underlie digital repositories is a basic issue in long-term preservation. Errors and failures in systems and storage puts preserved material at risk - of becoming 'unpreserveď ! The information technology industry has impressive statistics, used to convince us all that we can indeed rely upon mass storage: mean times between failure of hard drives of over one hundred years; file read failures (from disc) on the order of one in 10 to the seventeenth power. However large datasets, including the massive files originating from audiovisual content, make these figures less impressive. Failure of systems and storage is a reality that large digital archives (petabytes of storage, thousands of disc drives, millions of read cycles per day) will have to manage. This paper will set out the principal strategies and measures available to archive managers for coping with system and storage failures. © 2011 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

S. Bauer; C. Becker,2011,Automated preservation: The case of digital raw photographs,"In digital preservation, a common approach for preservation actions is the migration to standardized formats. Full validation of the results of such conversion processes is required to ensure authenticity and trust. This process of quality assurance is a key obstacle to achieving scalability for large volumes of content. In this article, we address the quality assurance process for the preservation of born-digital photographs and validate conversions of raw image formats into standard formats such as Adobe Digital Negative. To achieve this, we rely on a systematic planning framework. We classify requirements that have to be evaluated according to their measurement needs. We extend an existing measurement framework using a combination of tools, image similarity algorithms, and purpose-built plugins. By combining metadata extraction, image rendering and comparison, and perceptual-level quality assurance, we evaluate the feasibility of automating the core part of quality assurance that is often the most costly part of preservation processes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."

This platform harvests the information from the institutions, preserves the information for the long term and disseminates the information as Linked Open Data. Our platform produces many different versions of the harvested data to keep the information accessible over time when, e.g., mapping the metadata or transcoding the multimedia files, but it also produces a lot of provenance information relating all those different versions of a resource. For publishing this information as Linked Open Data, we extended our Linked Open Data server with Memento datetime content negotiation. Next to this, we extended the Memento framework to also publish the provenance information of those datetime content negotiated versions using an HTTP provenance link header for automatic discovery of the provenance information. This way, our framework allows to publish the information of a resource as Linked Open Data, including all its previous versions and their provenance information, in a web-accessible manner."
S. Gordea; A. Lindley; R. Graf,2011,Computing recommendations for long term data accessibility basing on open knowledge and linked data,"Digital access to our cultural heritage assets was facilitated through the rapid development of the digitization process and online publishing initiatives as Europeana or the Google books project. As Galleries, Libraries, Archiving institutions and Museums (GLAM) created digital representations of their masterpieces new concerns arise regarding the longterm accessibility of digitized and digitally born content. Repository managers of institutions need to take well documented decisions with regard to which digital object representations to use for archiving or long term access to their valuable collections. The digital preservation recommender system presented within this paper aims at reducing the complexity in the process of decision making by providing support for classification and the preservation risk analysis of digital objects. Technical information which is available as linked data in open knowledge sources facilitates the construction of the DiPRec's recommender knowledge base. This paper presents the DiPRec recommender system, a community approach on how to achieve the generation of well founded and trusted recommendations through open linked data and inferred knowledge in the domain of long-term information preservation for GLAM institutions."

S. Lim; C. L. Liew,2011,Metadata quality and interoperability of GLAM digital images,"Purpose: This study aims to explore how metadata have been applied in GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives and museums) institutions in New Zealand (NZ) and to analyse its overall quality with the interoperability of the metadata element set especially in mind. Design/methodology/approach: The first stage of data collection involved an analysis of the metadata records from 16 institutions from the NZ GLAM sector to examine the types and extent of metadata used. However, by looking at publicly accessible metadata records, it was impossible to determine the full extent of metadata created, especially when there could be metadata that were kept in-house. This was complemented with interviewing of staff from the institutions concerned. Findings: The study found that metadata records for digital images in four types of institutions have different emphases on metadata functions and a variety of metadata are not applied on a consistent basis. The lack of technical data in metadata records means that digital visual images are not always well protected. There is a consensus among those interviewed that metadata sharing is important. However, the wide use of a proprietary system which comes with pre-existing metadata fields could result in a lack of flexibility and a risk that institutions adopt cataloguing practices to accommodating their collection management systems rather than to the requirements for interoperability and long-term preservation. Originality/value: In addition to studying metadata quality in GLAM digital image repositories, the study also examined the rationale and factors affecting the current practice via interviews with representatives from the institutions concerned. This shed light on potential barriers to interoperability that warranted further examination. © ."

As one of the research communities focusing on very high quality digital content, CineGrid addresses these issues by building a global-scale distributed storage platform suitable for handling high quality digital media, which we call CineGrid Exchange (CX). Today, the CX connects seven universities and research laboratories in five countries, managing 400TB of storage, of which 250TB are dedicated to CineGrid. All of these sites are interconnected through a 10 Gbps dedicated optical network. The CX distributed repository holds digital motion pictures at HD, 2K and 4K resolutions, digital still images and digital audio in various formats. The goals of the CX are: (1) providing a 10 Gbps interconnected distributed platform for the CineGrid community to study digital content related issues, e.g., digital archiving, the movie production process, and network transfer/streaming protocols; (2) building a tool with which people can securely store, easily share and transfer very high definition digital content worldwide for exhibition and real-time collaboration; (3) automating digital policies through middleware and metadata management. In this publication, we introduce the architecture of the CX, resources managed by the CX and the implementation of the first series of CX management policies using the iRODS programmable middleware. We evaluate the first phase of CX platform implementation. We show that the CX has the potential to be a reliable and scalable digital management system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."""
S. M. McMeekin,2011,With a Little Help from OAIS: Starting down the Digital Curation Path,"Embarking on a digital curation programme can be a daunting prospect as it is thought to be an expensive and complex endeavour, beyond the capability and resources of most archives. Added to this is the fact that the overabundance of resources now available is almost as much of a deterrent to those entering the field as the lack of resources was 10 years ago. This article, based on a paper given to the Society of Archivists' Conference in 2010, will discuss why the fear might be, to a certain extent, unjustified, and how organizations can take the first steps towards developing systems and procedures for managing digital objects in their care. Using work carried out at the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland as an example, it will focus on issues relating to the development of ingest systems and procedures and will raise a number of questions relating to acquisition and appraisal of digital collections that would benefit from further discussion within the archival community. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

There is a need for preservation systems and processes to support such long-term retention requirements and enable the usability of those digital objects in the distant future, regardless of changes in technologies and designated communities. A key component in such preservation systems is the storage subsystem where the digital objects are located for most of their lifecycle. We describe SIRF (Self-contained Information Retention Format) - a logical storage container format specialized for long term retention. SIRF includes a set of digital preservation objects and a catalog with metadata related to the entire contents of the container as well as to the individual objects and their interrelationship. SIRF is being developed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)1 with the intention of creating a standardized vendor-neutral storage format that will be interpretable by future preservation systems and that will simplify and reduce the costs of digital preservation.

S. Sacchi; K. Wickett; A. Renear; D. Dubin,2011,A framework for applying the concept of significant properties to datasets,"The concept of signi cant properties, properties that must be identified and preserved in any successful digital object preservation, is now common in data curation. Although this notion has clearly demonstrated its usefulness in cultural heritage domains its application to the preservation of scientific datasets is not as well developed. One obstacle to this application is that the familiar preservation models are not sufficiently explicit to identify the relevant entities, properties, and relationships involved in dataset preservation. We present a logic-based formal framework of dataset concepts that provides the levels of abstraction necessary to identify and correctly assign significant properties to their appropriate entities. A unique feature of this model is that it recognizes that a typed symbol structure is a unique requirement for datasets, but not for other information objects."

Nom is an ideographic script to represent Vietnamese, used from the 10th century to 20th century. Because of various complex layouts, we propose an efficient method based on connected component analysis for extraction of characters from images. The area Voronoi diagram is then employed to represent the neighborhood and boundary of connected components. Based on this representation, each character can be considered as a group of extracted adjacent Voronoi regions. To improve the performance of segmentation, we use the recursive x-y cut method to segment separated regions. We evaluate the performance of this method on several pages in different layouts. The results confirm that the method is effective for character segmentation in Nom documents. © 2011 ACM."

U. M. Munshi; B. B. Chaudhuri,2011,Multimedia Information Extraction And Digital Heritage Preservation,"Multimedia Information Extraction and Digital Heritage Preservation is an edited volume of contributions by various distinguished researchers on issues in digital libraries, particularly in connection with heritage documents. This excellent collection of 21 papers covers various aspects of the problem. Cultural and scientific heritage resources are of fundamental value for human civilization, and their preservation is of utmost importance to mankind. Such preservation work has two aspects. First, the preservation of original objects and documents at source or in museums, and two, preservation of their imaged replica in digital form in libraries and other archives. The second approach is essential because objects may disintegrate due to age or ruin by disasters like earthquake, fire, flood, war and also vandalism. The imaged replica and associated digital database will at least prove their past existence and provide sufficient information if they are wiped out of the world. Even for physical preservation of the currently available heritage documents, digital systems and approaches are of great importance in many ways. This book contains efforts on digital preservation of both textual and non-textual matters. In addition, it focuses on digital content and community building for archiving and global sharing of cultural and heritage resources. It contains work ranging from multimedia digital library development, image retrieval from traditional metadata-based to content-based indexing and retrieval, making it a blend of traditional and contemporary issues in the digital preservation and information extraction of heritage documents. The volume focuses on research-oriented work, which can help opening up new vistas of research for the research community, and explore new mechanisms of retrieval of information from Multi-media documents, particularly from heritage documents, apart from using the conventional methods. This volume would find its place among personnel in libraries, museum, archives and other such institutions dealing with preservation, archiving and retrieval of heritage documents. Among the academic community, computer science, library science and information science community will also benefit from this book. © 2011 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

V. G. Cerf,2011,"Avoiding bit rot"": Long-term preservation of digital information""","Several tools are available to preserve the information in the digital format. The formats of the digital objects are very much software dependent. The ability to process the documents optically presents some potential for longevity. Two-dimensional barcodes or other high-density digital representations might survive for a long time. The proper interpretation of the formatted information will depend first on being able to properly demodulate the optical patterns and, second, on the ability to correctly interpret the digital content. The digital objects that are created are presentable in purely optical form and may include sound, imagery, software, various databases, and other digital information forms, all of which must be properly interpreted (by software) to correctly render the digital content in the form intended. The open standards have the beneficial property that they can be made widely available and multiple implementations may be available, giving choice to users."
W. C. Regli; J. B. Kopena; M. Grauer,2011,On the long-term retention of geometry-centric digital engineering artifacts,"This paper discusses the challenges of long-term preservation of digital geometric models and the engineering processes associated with them. For engineering, design, manufacturing, and physics-based simulation data this requires formats that are accessible potentially indefinitely into the future. One of the fundamental challenges is the development of digital geometry-centric engineering representations that are self describing and assured to be interpretable over the long lifespans required by archival applications. Additionally, future users may have needs that require other information, going beyond geometry, be also accessible to fully interpret the model. These problems are highly interdisciplinary and not exclusively algorithmic or technical. To provide context, the paper introduces a case study illustrating an overall portrait of the problem. Based on observations from this case study, we present a framework for enhancing the preservation of geometry-centric engineering knowledge. This framework is currently being used on a number of projects in engineering education. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

W. Xu; M. Esteva; S. D. Jain; V. Jain,2011,Analysis of large digital collections with interactive visualization,"To make decisions about the long-term preservation and access of large digital collections, archivists gather information such as the collections' contents, their organizational structure, and their file format composition. To date, the process of analyzing a collection - from data gathering to exploratory analysis and final conclusions - has largely been conducted using pen and paper methods. To help archivists analyze large-scale digital collections for archival purposes, we developed an interactive visual analytics application. The application narrows down different kinds of information about the collection, and presents them as meaningful data views. Multiple views and analysis features can be linked or unlinked on demand to enable researchers to compare and contrast different analyses, and to identify trends. We describe and present two user scenarios to show how the application allowed archivists to learn about a collection with accuracy, facilitated decision-making, and helped them arrive at conclusions. © 2011 IEEE."
Y. Bok; Y. Jeong; D. G. Choi; I. S. Kweon,2011,Capturing village-level heritages with a hand-held camera-laser fusion sensor,"Preserving a heritage as a digital archive is as important as preserving its physical structure. The digital preservation is essential for massive heritages which are often defenceless against various types of destruction and require frequent restorations. However, capturing heritages gets exceedingly harder as their scale grows. In this paper, we present a novel approach to reconstruct a massive-scale structure using a hand-held fusion sensor system. The approach includes new methods on calibration, motion estimation, and accumulated error reduction. The proposed sensor system consists of four cameras and two 2D laser scanners to obtain a wide field-of-view. A new calibration method successfully achieves a much lower reprojection error compared to the previous method. A motion estimation method provides accurate and robust relative poses by fully utilizing plenty observations. At the last stage, the accumulated error reduction removes the drift occurred over tens of thousands frames by adopting weak GPS prior and loop closing. Therefore the system is able to capture and geo-register large heritage architectures of square kilometers size. Furthermore, because no assumption or restriction is made, the user can freely move the system and can control the level of detail of the digital heritage without any effort. To demonstrate the performance, we have captured several important Korean heritages including Gyeongbok-Gung, the royal palace of Korea. The experimental result shows that the estimated route fits Google's satellite image and DGPS data while the detailed appearances of representative constructions are captured and preserved well. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

The authors of this paper use the case study approach to develop an activity-based costing (ABC) model. This is used for estimating the costs of preserving digital research data and identifying options for improving and sustaining relevant activities. The model is designed in the environment of the Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) institute, a well-known trusted repository. The DANS-ABC model has been tested on empirical cost data from activities performed by 51 employees in frames of over 40 different national and international projects. Costs of resources are being assigned to cost objects through activities and cost drivers. The 'euros per dataset' unit of costs measurement is introduced to analyse the outputs of the model. Funders, managers and other decision-making stakeholders are being provided with understandable information connected to the strategic goals of the organisation. The latter is being achieved by linking the DANS-ABC model to another widely used managerial tool-the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). The DANS-ABC model supports costing of services provided by a data archive, while the combination of the DANS-ABC with a BSC identifies areas in the digital preservation process where efficiency improvements are possible. © 2012 The Author(s)."

A. Stenzer; B. Freitag,2012,An approach to query relaxation using ontologies in a GIS-based archiving system,"The MonArch Digital Archiving System is a metadata repository designed for the storage, management and retrieval of digital documents and digital information in general. In contrast to conventional document management systems, the MonArch System uses semantical technologies to improve content descriptions. Furthermore, GIS functionality and navigation maps allow for the geo-referencing of documents and thus for visually locating and selecting the archived content. Together, the semantical and spatial markups allow for powerful queries that are fully adaptable to the needs of a wide variety of scenarios. In a federated network of archives each repository could benefit from the accumulated but distributed information. To capitalise on this advantage, coping with the inevitable disparities of the description schemata is one of the major challenges. Therefore, a distributed query facility must be able to bridge different schemata as well as the particular domain and purpose of each repository. In this paper an approach to query relaxation in the application domain of digital preservation of built heritage is presented. The proposed method is based on similarity which in turn can be inferred from the structural properties and a type-based classification of the descriptive metadata attached to the stored objects. The resulting approach reduces significantly the otherwise necessary manual schema integration work which tends to rely on domain experts. © 2012 ACM."
B. A. Jurik; A. B. Nielsen; E. M. O. Zierau,2012,Flexible bit preservation on a national basis,"In this paper we present the results from The Danish National Bit Repository project. The project aim was establishment of a system that can offer flexible and sustainable bit preservation solutions to Danish cultural heritage institutions. Here the bit preservation solutions must include support of bit safety as well as other requirements like e.g. confidentiality and availability. The Danish National Bit Repository is motivated by the need to investigate and handle bit preservation for digital cultural heritage. Digital preservation relies on the integrity of the bits which digital material consists of, and it is with this focus that the project was initiated. This paper summarizes the requirements for a general system to offer bit preservation to cultural heritage institutions. On this basis the paper describes the resulting flexible system which can support such requirements. The paper will explain principles and design, as well as how both design and implementations can be used by any institution or company with requirements to bit preservation. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

B. Mak,2012,On the uses of authenticity,"Scholars and professionals across the disciplines have adopted the concept of authenticity to help focus growing concerns about the digital preservation of archival materials, but authenticity itself remains a major point of controversy in these debates. The present article offers an alternative view of the impasse by investigating a similar moment of disquiet in the early modern period. In these prior contests, disagreements about authenticity emerged as an effective way to renegotiate the social order. Scholars proposed and tested different senses of authenticity, vowing temporary allegiance to the one that suited their particular case. By examining some of these feuds, this article demonstrates that arguments about authenticity can function as a means of instigating social change, and suggests that this understanding of authenticity may productively be brought to bear on contemporary discussions about the curation and use of digitally encoded materials."

Aleijadinho, which is an important American baroque artist. The set was made in the beginning of the XIX century and is composed of 12 near real sized sculptures, hand-carved in soapstone. These sculptures represent 12 of the 16 prophets from the Holy Bible and are part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Our group has been collaborating with UNESCO in a project that aims to preserve all these statues. We hereby present our initial efforts, consisting of the 3D digital preservation of the Prophet Joel sculpture. We developed a complete 3D digital preservation pipeline composed of four main stages: data acquisition, 3D reconstruction, texture generation and 3D model visualization. By evaluating our results in this first sculpture, we discuss the improvements we conceived before applying our pipeline in the remaining ones. Finally, we present the 3D model of the Prophet which registers the sculpture's current state and will be used in restoration, research and educational activities. We believe this contribution may be useful to guide further research on similar scenarios, showing how to avoid some practical mistakes and achieve good results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

B. Trinchão Andrade; O. R. P. Bellon; L. Silva; A. Vrubel,2012,Digital preservation of Brazilian indigenous artworks: Generating high quality textures for 3D models,"Three-dimensional (3D) digital preservation aims at generating 3D models of objects that have cultural or scientific value. It allows realistic visualization of objects through virtual museums or scientific applications, and the restoration of the preserved object in case of natural wear or accidents. This work contributes to this research area by presenting a method to improve color texture quality of 3D models obtained from color and depth images of a laser scanner. Although this device offers precise depth information, the resulting color information is still poor and limits the generation of realistic textures. Our approach is to capture photographs of the object with a high-resolution digital camera and use them to generate a new color texture for the 3D model. Our work proposes a practical technique, easy to replicate, to generate high quality textures for 3D models from photographs. The method is composed by three main steps: (1) calibration of the image acquisition devices; (2) data acquisition; and (3) texture generation. In this paper, we detail our color texture generation method and apply it on the digital preservation of many artworks made by native Brazilians (indians) from the Wauja and Karaja communities. These indigenous communities are acknowledged as great ceramic artists, each bearing their own main themes, using a very rich symbolism in their paintings. Their artworks represent important aspects of the native South American culture and their digital preservation is motivated by three main reasons: (1) their fragility; (2) the paintings loose their original appearance with time; and (3) the possibility of extinction of these communities. We present several results of preserved artworks with enhanced quality realistic texture maps. Also, we present a methodology to analyze the quality and accuracy of texture maps. The resulting 3D models can be visualized through a tool we developed to support the virtual exhibit of 3D preserved heritage. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS."

The traditional workflow for insect collection digitization involves manually keying information from specimen labels into a database and attaching a unique identifier label to each specimen. This remains the dominant paradigm, despite some recent attempts to automate various steps in the process using more advanced technologies. InvertNet aims to develop improved semi-automated, high-throughput workflows for digitizing and providing access to invertebrate collections that balance the need for speed and cost-effectiveness with long-term preservation of specimens and accuracy of data capture. The proposed workflows build on recent methods for digitizing and providing access to high-quality images of multiple specimens (e.g., entire drawers of pinned insects) simultaneously. Limitations of previous approaches are discussed and possible solutions are proposed that incorporate advanced imaging and 3-D reconstruction technologies. InvertNet couples efficient digitization workflows with a highly robust network infrastructure capable of managing massive amounts of image data and related metadata and delivering high-quality images, including interactive 3-D reconstructions in real time via the Internet."

C. Klück,2012,Zooming in on the big picture: Digitization of nitrate panoramic film,"Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has made significant changes in the storage of the institution's cellulose nitrate collection and made great progress towards solving the problem of inaccessibility concerning nitrate panoramic film. LAC's vast collection of nitrate material includes 600,000 photographic negatives of which approximately 4,000 panoramas have remained inaccessible to both the public and archivists. The panoramas had previously been stored in their original housings, often multiple negatives per metal canister, at an offsite storage facility that was not considered conducive for the long-term preservation of nitrate material. As part of the preparations to move the nitrate collection to LACs new state-of-the-art Nitrate Film Preservation Facility (NFPF) staff described, assessed, measured, and rehoused each panoramic negative by separating the panoramas, individually rolling, then wrapping them in bond paper and placing them in boxes in an upright position. In February 2011, the entire nitrate collection was relocated to this new facility, which includes a collection processing room and a digitization room. Building on the initial research undertaken by Greg Hill and Tania Passafiume (presented at the IS&T conference in 2006[1]), this paper will outline how staff established a successful workflow to digitize a selection of 1,500 panoramas from the Merrilees collection. This collection is in high demand but the panoramas have been restricted in access due to the fragility of the material. The selected panoramas are mainly images of Canadian Expeditionary Force battalions from the First World War, with the negatives measuring up to 2.6 metres (9 feet) in length. After digitization the images will be uploaded to the LAC website. In light of the upcoming 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War it is anticipated that the public, through web-based crowdsourcing, will help in the identification of many of the soldiers in the panoramas. This discussion will highlight several challenges such as the limited options of equipment and setup available when digitizing nitrate panoramic film, and dealing with a medium affected by deterioration. A complete review will also be presented of the new process developed to obtain a high resolution preservation scan thereby allowing public access to the panoramas while simultaneously preserving the original material in a secure and controlled environment. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

C. Wu,2012,Embedding digital preservation across the organisation: A case study of internal collaboration in the National Library of New Zealand,"Successful implementation of a digital preservation programme relies on many well known factors, including strong management support, adequate funding, appropriate technology and motivated staff possessing the required skill sets. Naturally, very few organisations would cite disinterest in collaborating externally to pursue such initiatives. However, one noticeable pitfall that can ensnare organisations is the delay in engaging the wider organisation in the software development lifecycle. As a result, the digital preservation programme runs the risk of reducing its effectiveness when integrating digital preservation management throughout the organisation. Using the National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ) as an example, this case study illustrates how its digital preservation programme, the National Digital Heritage Archive (NDHA): • used internal collaboration to prepare its integration with the Library's infrastructure. • laid the foundation for the programme as it moved from project mode into business as usual. • provided the basis of the ongoing relationship between the organisation and the digital preservation programme. The National Library of New Zealand's experience offers a unique insight into the use of internal collaboration strategies within a digital preservation programmet. ft is hoped that this study will be beneficial to other organisations in the process of implementing their own digital preservation programmes and encourage strong internal collaboration practices. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

The proposed system keeps and extends the current OAI-PMH protocol characteristics and is designed as a set of OAI repositories, where each repository has an independent fail probability assigned to it. Items are inserted with a reliability that is satisfied by replicating them in subsets of repositories. Communication between the nodes (repositories) of the network is organized in a distributed hash table and multiple hash functions are used to select repositories that keep the replicas of each stored item. The OAI characteristics combined with a structured P2P digital preservation system allow the construction of a reliable and totally distributed digital library.

In the last decade there has been an increasing awareness that bit preservation, which is to keep bits intact and readable, is far more complex than first anticipated, even in this narrow definition. This paper takes a more holistic approach to bit preservation, and looks at how an optimal bit preservation strategy can be found, when requirements like confidentiality, availability and costs are taken into account. Design/methodology/approach: The paper describes the various findings from previous research which have led to the holistic approach to bit preservation. This paper also includes an introduction to digital preservation with a focus on the role of bit preservation, which sets the scene for why bit preservation deserves attention in a holistic approach. Findings: The paper presents different means to find an optimal bit preservation strategy. This consists of a model to delimit bit preservation activities, and will briefly discuss how specific material can require different bit preservation strategies as well as pointing to how such strategies can be evaluated. Research limitations/implications: The operational results described here are still missing work to be fully operational. However, the holistic approach is in itself an important result.

G. Knight,2012,A Digital Curate's Egg: A Risk Management Approach to Enhancing Data Management Practices,"This article provides a case study of work performed at King's College London to survey information management practices, policies, and procedures applied by data creators and managers within three research units and three business units, and to determine the risk factors that may limit access and use of their digital assets over time. The assessment framework adopted to assess practices brings together components of the Data Asset Framework to analyze ad hoc data handling processes performed within departments, and combines it with the system-level Digital Repository Audit Methodology Based on Risk Assessment evaluation framework to identify the potential risks that may occur and the consequences to the institution or individual unless action is taken. It was found that data management activities within the academic units are comparable to a curate's egg, containing many actions performed in conformance to best practice, but also including poorly considered approaches that have the potential to restrict access and use of digital information over time. To address the identified risk factors, a holistic, multi-tiered approach should be adopted through the development of an institution-level management infrastructure and policy framework, supported by ongoing training and advice for staff directly working with data. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

H. R.

The balance between the practical and the theoretical components can be discussed: As Digital Humanities - and Digital Curation as part of it - stand at a nexus between traditional Humanities and Social Sciences, this balance may be less obvious, a position at that nexus is particularly rewarding however. The need for developments within Computer Science has to be determined by the joined conceptual mandate, however. To provide for an understanding of this conceptual mandate, we describe the development of digital curation. As a term it can be traced back to the early nineties, as a extremely vivid research agenda, with many international links, it has created a plethora of projects, conferences and publications since the early years of this century."

There are many viable applications, models, strategies, and standards for long-term care of digital objects. However, many institutions are either not aware of the options or do not currently have the ability to evaluate and implement them.The Closing the Digital Curation Gap (CDCG) project aims to provide guidance for professionals in small- to medium-sized repositories. We have elicited requirements from users through focus groups and semi-structured interviews. We are developing Digital Curation Guides to assist information professionals who are new to digital curation activities. We report on findings from the focus groups and interviews that inform the design of the guides. We also place our findings within the context of other work including the Digital Curation Centre's Digital Curation Lifecycle Model, the DigCCurr Matrix of Digital Curation Knowledge and Competencies, the Library of Congress' Digital Preservation Outreach and Education (DPOE) activities, the Society of American Archivists' (SAA) Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) Certificate program, the DigCCurr Professional Institute, the European Commission-funded DigCurV training program, and the emerging CDCG Guides."
I. Subotic; L. Rosenthaler; H. Schuldt,2012,A benchmark for RDF-based metadata management in distributed long-term digital preservation,"In a large variety of applications, the long-term, guaranteed availability of data is becoming increasingly important. Thus, long-term digital preservation systems have to be inherently distributed to allow content to be replicated. This affects both the preservation of the actual digital objects and their associated metadata. For the latter, RDF has become the prevalent data model. Ensuring data integrity and consistency requires periodic checks to timely detect inconsistencies, for instance due to (partial) hardware failures, and trigger repair actions. Hence, the access characteristics to metadata in long-term digital preservation significantly differs from metadata management in other types of applications. In addition, the increasing size of digital archives challenges the consistency checks of the associated metadata. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for triple store-based metadata management that jointly takes into account the specific access patterns of long-term preservation systems: i.) complex periodic consistency checks, ii.) concurrent read and write requests to the archive, and iii.) the actions to be taken on data to re-establish consistency if a violation has been detected. Furthermore, we present the results of this benchmark applied to our distributed long-term digital preservation system DISTARNET. © 2012 IEEE."

The project aims at a holistic view on the preservation of business processes over long-term periods. This view includes the business software as a well as all related context information for re-use at a later point in time. Digital preservation ensures continued access to digital information over time (e.g., 5, 15, 25 or 50 years). The longterm planning horizon of preserving relevant parts of a business processes raises a number of new research challenges for software design, development and maintenance. Current service-oriented systems are using distributed services from different providers located at different geographical locations. Workflows and business processes are volatile in terms of services disappearing and fundamental changes in technology. TIMBUS researches on methods, processes and tools to ensure continued access to information based on preserving relevant data and their context (e.g., services, software and the data's meaning).

J. Brewer; T. Popp; J. Perrin,2012,REDDNET and digital preservation in the open cloud: Research at Texas Tech University libraries on long-term archival storage,"In the realm of digital data, vendor-supplied cloud systems will still leave the user with responsibility for curation of digital data. Some of the very tasks users thought they were delegating to the cloud vendor may be a requirement for users after all. For example, cloud vendors most often require that users maintain archival copies. Beyond the better known vendor cloud model, we examine curation in two other models: inhouse clouds, and what we call open"" clouds which are neither inhouse clouds nor vendor supported clouds. In open clouds, users come aboard as participants or partners for example, by being invited to participate in development or in hosting hardware. In open cloud systems users can develop their own software and data management, control access, and purchase their own hardware while running securely in the cloud environment. To do so will still require working within the rules of the cloud system, but in some open cloud systems those restrictions and limitations can be walked around easily with surprisingly little loss of freedom. It is in this context that REDDnet (Research and Education Data Depot network) is presented as the place where the Texas Tech University (TTU)) Libraries have been conducting research on long-term digital archival storage. The REDDnet network by year's end will be at 1.2 petabytes (PB) with an additional 1.4 PB for a related project (Compact Muon Soleniod Heavy Ion [CMS-HI]); additionally there are over 200 TB of tape storage. These numbers exclude any disk space which TTU will be purchasing during the year. National Science Foundation (NSF) funding covering REDDnet and CMS-HI was in excess of $850,000 with $850,000 earmarked toward REDDnet. In the terminology we used above, REDDnet is an open cloud system that invited TTU Libraries to participate. This means that we run software which fits the REDDnet structure. We are beginning the final design of our system, and moving into the first stages of construction. And we have made a decision to move forward to purchase one-half PB of disk storage in the initial phase. The concerns, deliberations and testing are presented here along with our initial approach."""
J. Brunsmann; W. Wilkes; G. Schlageter; M. Hemmje,2012,State-of-the-art of long-term preservation in product lifecycle management,"Providing access to digital information for the indefinite future is the intention of long-term digital preservation systems. One application domain that certainly needs to implement such long-term digital preservation processes is the design and engineering industry. In this industry, products are designed, manufactured, and operated with the help of sophisticated software tools provided by product lifecycle management (PLM) systems. During all PLM phases, including geographically distributed cross-domain and cross-company collaboration, a huge amount of heterogeneous digital product data and metadata is created. Legal and economic requirements demand that this product data has to be archived and preserved for a long-time period. Unfortunately, the software that is able to interpret the data will become obsolete earlier than the data since the software and hardware lifecycle is relatively short-lived compared to a product lifecycle. Companies in the engineering industry begin to realize that their data is in danger of becoming unusable while the products are in operation for several decades. To address this issue, different academic and industrial initiatives have been initiated that try to solve this problem. This article provides an overview of these projects including their motivations, identified problems, and proposed solutions. The studied projects are also verified against a classification of important aspects regarding scope and functionality of digital preservation in the engineering industry. Finally, future research topics are identified. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."
J. E. Beaudoin,2012,A framework for contextual metadata used in the digital preservation of cultural objects,"The quality and the quantity of contextual information found in the descriptive metadata associated with digital representations of cultural objects are frequently inadequate for assuring that users will understand the nature of both the original object that has been digitally preserved, and the digital representation itself. This paper proposes and defines a framework for ensuring that relevant contextual metadata is easily collected and maintained. After identifying and describing eight important dimensions of context, the paper shows how implementing the framework, through a series of questions and prompts, results in a descriptive metadata record that accommodates the important aspects of an object's context. Using two very different cultural objects as examples, an Etruscan tomb painting and a 19th century bridge, the framework demonstrates that sufficient contextual information can be recorded in a metadata schema to enable effective future search, retrieval, examination, use, management, and preservation interactions. © 2012 Joan E.

J. E. Beaudoin,2012,Context and its role in the digital preservation of cultural objects,"In discussions surrounding digital preservation, context - those properties of an object related to its creation and preservation that make the object's origins, composition, and purpose clear - has been identified as a critical aspect of preservation metadata. Understanding a cultural object's context, in as much detail as possible, is necessary to the successful future use of that object, regardless of its form. The necessity of capturing data about the creation of digital resources and the technical details of the preservation process, has generally been agreed. Capturing many other contextual aspects - such as utility, history, curation, authenticity - that would certainly contribute to successful retrieval, assessment, management, access, and use of preserved digital content, has not been adequately addressed or codified. Recording these aspects of contextual information is especially important for physical objects that are digitally preserved, and thereby removed from their original setting. This paper investigates the various discussions in the literature surrounding contextual information, and then presents a framework which makes explicit the various dimensions of context which have been identified as useful for digital preservation efforts, and offers a way to ensure the capture those aspects of an object's context that are often missed. © 2012 Joan E.

J. E. LaBarca,2012,Preservation of photographic images for future generations: New opportunities for prints and photo books,"Upon discovering the 120 year old object in their grandparents' attic, most people today would be hard-pressed to play back a recording made on a wax cylinder of the late 1800s. What will people do just 50 years from now with an optical disk or magnetic hard drive? Over time, we have recorded our memories in many ways: letters, post cards, photographs, movies, audio and video recordings are a few examples. In earlier days, interpreting those recordings was independent of the technology used to create them - you could hold and view a hard copy document in your hand. How will future generations deal with those post cards, letters to the family, and photographs that have now been replaced by Word documents"", email, and digital images on the computer? While professional and mass-portrait labs recognize the importance of hard copy images, the word needs to spread from there. The end consumer in particular needs to become aware of long-term storage issues that relate to the preservation of the data behind digital documents including photographic images. Longerterm issues beyond routine backup and migration of data need to be considered, and preservation via human-readable hardcopy images is a key option. This paper provides an update on preservation strategies for the consumer and suggestions for the professional imaging laboratories to communicate these strategies to the consumer. While the familiar advice to ""make a hard copy"" provides a solid foundation, we go beyond this recommendation, with the intent to raise consumer awareness of the need to create a long-term preservation plan for their most treasured images and the data behind them. © 2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""

The Seokguram Grotto was the first to be registered at UNESCO among South Korean cultural heritages in year 1996. Hence, we are able to understand the value and the significance of the existence of Seokguram Grotto amongst numerous cultural heritages of South Korea. The team had performed the digitalization process of Seokguram Grotto in cooperation with the National Museum of Korea in year 2008 and had also performed the digitalization process of Seokguram Grotto with the Cultural Heritage Administration in year 2011. Through the process of 3D Scans and et cetera, the team had successfully digitalized the Seokguram Grotto as the world's first. This thesis consists of the process of the digitalization of Seokguram Grotto, the process of generating its 3D stereopsis and the future blueprints for creating Seokguram Grotto's Virtual Museum in the future. In other words, the current level is limited to archiving and creating 3D stereopsis of Seokguram Grotto, and the Seokguram Grotto Virtual Museum is expected to be built at Sejong City in the future on the basis of 3D scan data of Seokguram Grotto. The values of Seokguram Grotto which upholds cultural legacy and how they can be digitalized with advanced exhibition technology in delivering quality approaches of its exhibition are the core subjects of this thesis. © 2012 IEEE."
J. K. Chiang; K. Huang,2012,Developing governmental archival system on semantic grid,"Long-term preservation (LTP) is to improve the sustainability of archives last for a foreseeable enough time. The efforts are primarily hampered by challenges such as missing of stands, formal methodology and workflow model during archiving. Further deficits are failing to keep interoperation among archives, information loss without any sense of information decay etc. Objective of this research is to explore the LTP of various kinds of documents independent from the evolution of time and changes in techniques and digital environments. Basic requirements come from integration of storage management and information management, securing preservation of data, metadata, indexes, etc. This paper presents the evolutionary development of the LTP process for Governmental Archive Management and Knowledge Management with respect to above requirements. Effective search to resources and efficient storage/access on data, consistent user-interface, recovery drawing on co-location back-up, dynamic regulation on authentication and security management are tasks followed. Then, a pilot Semantic Data Grid and its annotation and service matching mechanisms are described, where the ontologism play a crucial role. Last but not least, experiences learned and the future works with respect to the semantic grid for LTP will be summarized."

Self-preserving objects represent a new, object-centric paradigm for digital preservation. Here, we present a swarm-inspired model for the behaviours of self-preserving objects with backup and format redundancy that are assigned individual and social behaviours with a mission. The mission of these objects is their long-term preservation, which entails being accessible and reproducible by users at any time in the future regardless of frequent technological changes due to software and hardware vendors' upgrades. Numerous experiments with swarm behaviours are performed taking into account the costs of digital preservation. Run for a series of 3 major shifts in software and hardware generations over 20 years was used to evaluate the resilience of the self-preserving digital objects.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the literature on existing digital information preservation around the world, and then focuses on Latin American countries. It proposes a framework in which to analyze the situation in developing countries, particularly in Latin America, and summarizes the issues in six preservation factors and seven principles of preservation. Findings: The amount of digital information has increased geometrically without proper knowledge, theories, strategies, policies and proceedings to preserve it. Developed countries and regions have started to create this knowledge and know-how, as well as setting the basis to manage their digital collections within libraries, archives, and other organizations with the aim to preserve them in the long-term. The situation is radically different in Latin America where we found limited research and projects on digital preservation. Practical implications: The problem of the long-term authentic preservation of digital document collections is not a simple technology problem; it is a much more complex one. This paper summarizes the approaches to understand it but further study is required in order to develop a practical strategy and/or plan. It also highlights the importance of raising awareness of digital preservation in Latin America in order to ensure availability in the future. Social implications: Research, planning, initiatives and proper execution in regard to digital collections preservation is extremely limited in Latin American developing countries, thus endangering vast amounts of digital information. There is a serious risk that valuable digital information will not be preserved adequately for future generations. Originality/value: This paper reviews the main challenges for libraries and archives to preserve digital information over the long term and summarizes the main issues to understand and to thwart this problem.

A special emphasis is put on the possible wider adoption of the tool for small and mid-sized institutions and the call for community building around it. CINCH does not relate directly to storage or access, but it does address the need for appropriately formatted SIPs to ensure the fixity, authenticity, and long-term manageability of our digital assets. As a broadly accessible tool with generalized purpose, its greatest impact will be on small and mid-sized institutions and organizations that do not now have access to an application of this nature. CINCH 2.0 planning is already underway. Improving the quality and range of metadata, exploring DRM restrictions, and expanding the types of harvestable files are at the top of the development list.

Renear,2012,Identifying content and levels of representation in scientific data,"Heterogeneous digital data that has been produced by different communities with varying practices and assumptions, and that is organized according to different representation schemes, encodings, and file formats, presents substantial obstacles to efficient integration, analysis, and preservation. This is a particular impediment to data reuse and interdisciplinary science. An underlying problem is that we have no shared formal conceptual model of information representation that is both accurate and sufficiently detailed to accommodate the management and analysis of real world digital data in varying formats. Developing such a model involves confronting extremely challenging foundational problems in information science. We present two complementary conceptual models for data representation, the Basic Representation Model and the Systematic Assertion Model. We show how these models work together to provide an analytical account of digitally encoded scientific data. These models will provide a better foundation for understanding and supporting a wide range of data curation activities, including format migration, data integration, data reuse, digital preservation strategies, and assessment of identity and scientific equivalence.

K. Sangani,2012,The final reel [cinema distribution],"The article focuses on the digitization of film reels. IHS Insight announced earlier this year that digital cinema made up the majority format on global screens for the first time last year. The number of digital cinema screens in 2011 reached 63,825, equivalent to 51.5 per cent of global screens. Growth was hefty, with last year's overall numbers up 82 per cent from 35,070 screens in 2010. On the business side, the major improvements in the past year included full conversion to digital cinema for the larger exhibitors, along with a spread of the funding group mechanism to help otherwise struggling exhibitors achieve conversion. Furthermore, digital archiving faces challenges due to the insufficient temporal qualities of today's digital storage: no current media, be it optical discs, magnetic hard-drives or digital tape, can reliably store a film for a hundred years, something that properly stored and handled film arguably does."
L. Cantara,2012,METS: The metadata encoding and transmission standard,"The Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) is a data communication standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library, expressed using the XML Schema Language of the World Wide Web Consortium. An initiative of the Digital Library Federation, METS is under development by an international editorial board and is maintained in the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress. Designed in conformance with the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, a METS document encapsulates digital objects and metadata as Information Packages for transmitting and/or exchanging digital objects to and from digital repositories, disseminating digital objects via the Web, and archiving digital objects for long-term preservation and access. This paper represents an introduction to the METS standard and, through illustrated examples, how to build a METS document. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved."
L. F. Sayão; L. F. Sales,2012,Curatorship digital: A new platform for digital preservation of research data,"A considerable part of the results of research activities is being created in digital formats. Although valuable, these data are at risk of being lost by technological obsolescence and by the inherent fragility of digital media. Thus, the management of research data in a digital networked and distributed environment becomes an increasing challenge for the world of research and for the information science. In response to this challenge arises the concept of digital curation, which involves the management of research data from its planning, ensuring its long-term preservation, discovery, interpretation and reuse. In this sense, this study briefly examines the importance of research data and of the idea of digital curation and its impact on the formulation of new documents and scientific communication."

Ramalho,2012,Design and architecture of a novel preservation watch system,"Successful preservation of content requires sophisticated mechanisms for collecting, tracking and analyzing information about a multitude of relevant aspects. This is not limited to content itself, but also tracking of available software, other organization's content, usage statistics and trends, format risks, systems operations and many more. Such tracking requires a flexible system that supports evolution over time and provides an extensible platform for scalability. This article presents the system design of a novel approach towards automated monitoring of preservation-related information. We discuss the challenges and information sources that need to be covered, and describe the architecture and data model of a novel preservation watch system, currently under development. We discuss how this system addresses critical information needs for informed preservation management and outline next steps ahead. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

L. P. da Silva Junior; V. G. da Mota,2012,Digital preservation policy in Brazil: Characteristics and implementations,"A digital preservation policy serves as legal advice for managing the preservation and permanent access to digital objects created, selected and stored by their respective companies or institutions, and assists in overcoming the technological obsolescence of objects as well as the medium that supports them. Such policy is developed based on resolutions, regulations, administrative acts, laws, models and standards. It can be analyzed from the organizational, legal and technical aspects. Furthermore, a policy of digital preservation can be inserted in a wider preservation program, as declared by the Guidelines for the Preservation of Digital Heritage, developed by the Australian National Library and published by UNESCO in 2003. The Guidelines have served as the conceptual basis for the major international projects and initiatives in digital preservation. In Brazil, few institutions and companies have established a digital preservation policy. Among these, only the House of Representatives and the University of Campinas developed a comprehensive policy and have published it in their respective websites."
L. Phiri; K. Williams; M. Robinson; S. Hammar; H. Suleman,2012,Bonolo: A general digital library system for file-based collections,"There is an ever-increasing amount of digital content being generated that needs to be well-organised, preserved and made accessible. The majority of generic repository software tools that currently exist are, arguably, overly complex, thus making collections difficult to manage and maintain in resource constrained environments. A possible solution to this problem would, in part, require designing digital library tools and services that are simple and easy to manage. This paper describes a digital library system that is based on a set of design decisions aimed at simplifying repository software architectures. The proposed system makes use of a hierarchical file-store for storage of digital objects. Evaluation of the system by means of a user experience study was conducted to investigate the usefulness of the system, its relative ease of use and what effect, if any, the architecture would have on the user experience. Experimental results showed that users found the system useful, effective and easy to use and that the architecture did not appear to negatively influence the user experience. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

The study is based on a series of semi-structured interviews with forty-one historians, archivists, librarians, and web researchers. While the results reject the idea of a single ‘digital black hole’ in historical records, they emphasize the importance of the issue for the future of history, and the complexity of the solutions to be adopted. The need for planning, for education, and for cooperation between historians and the information professions is also emphasized. © CILIP 2012."
L. Saxena; A. Salgaonkar; J.

(The status report of a MS, the first step in the digital preservation and conservation of MS folios, provides a careful and detailed description of degradations present in it) Automating this process is desirable because manually noting the degradation is not only tedious and time-consuming, but is prone to calculation errors as well as further damage to MS folios. ASRG extensively uses image processing as well as segmentation techniques for the selection, separation and reporting of degradations. The model locates degradations as components present in the MS image and reports their computed measurements, mainly length, perimeter and area."
M. Á. Márdero Arellano,2012,Cariniana: A digital preservation national network,"The preservation of the electronic record of scientific results and historical and cultural heritage into digital documents develops new practices within the context of computer networks. The information is no longer in one location and management of these collections meets new challenges. The processing and organization of databases, repositories and digital libraries must incorporate preservation strategies related to its technological dependency: costs, policies, access and technical criteria. Ibict's Brazilian Network of Digital Preservation Services - Cariniana is an alternative for organizations that wish to collect, store, preserve and provide access to their most important collections from authorized digital copies in Brazil. To accomplish this digital preservation, Ibict joined Stanford University's LOCKSS Alliance, as it is in line with international standards already tested. Journals, books, electronic theses and dissertations are the target of the first stage of the project, and the training of professionals dedicated to record collections in digital format has been incorporated to the set of first actions of the Network. This paper presents the Cariniana Network project as a digital preservation system based on the distributed network model, which monitors and supports other Brazilian projects that require the preservation of authentic material, certified by recognized institutions."
M. Albani,2012,Long term preservation of earth observation data: The challenge and the cooperation activities,The preservation and accessibility of digital data and of their associated knowledge is today a very challenging and critical item in Europe. Earth Observation data are unique by nature and are fundamental for the monitoring of our environment and planet and of its changes. They are considered [1] as humankind asset and as such need to be preserved without time constrains and kept accessible together with all the information and knowledge needed to understand and use them in future. The creation of a cooperative and harmonized collective approach on Long Term Data Preservation (LTDP) in Europe in the Earth Observation domain was started at the beginning of 2008 under ESA leadership to coordinate and optimize European efforts in the LTDP domain and produced several results at the basis of an LTDP cooperative framework now in place in Europe. © 2012 IEEE.

M. E. Phillips,2012,Lessons learned from NARA's electronic records archives project,"The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration's Electronic Records Archives (ERA), built to hold the avalanche of electronic records being created by the federal government of the United States, recently reached a major milestone. On September 30, 2011 ERA's initial development phase ended and the operations and maintenance phase began. Begun in 2005, ERA incrementally deployed important functions starting in 2008, when the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) started ingesting its existing collection of electronic records into ERA and piloting the records management functions that allow federal agencies to create records schedules and transfer their permanent electronic records to NARA. As of January 30, 2012 ERA was storing more than 131 terabytes of records in a wide variety of formats from the United States Congress, federal Agencies, and the George W. Bush White House. This volume is just the beginning of what ERA will manage and store, though. For example, NARA has recently received around 300 terabytes of electronic records from the 2010 Census, currently being prepared for ingest into ERA. NARA is relying on ERA every day to perform a key part of its basic mission, and ERA provides a flexible foundation on which NARA can build increasingly sophisticated functions over time. ERA's successes are critical to the mission of the archives, but the challenges the project encountered and the lessons NARA learned along the way may be more valuable to the digital preservation community. This paper will provide a summary of what ERA is and highlights of the project's accomplishments, but will also discuss important decision points in planning and development, external constraints, lessons learned from the experience, and challenges remaining in the future. Lessons learned include the importance of project governance, strategies for maintaining control of the project, and the necessity of constantly communicating to ensure that stakeholder expectations are realistic. Challenges included managing a large number of disparate requirements for records governed under different legal frameworks and working under the constraints of legally mandated timeframes for records ingest and access. NARA's response to these challenges involved a solution architecture that includes a common architectural pattern shared by different instances within a system of systems. NARA will be relying on this flexible software framework, along with standardized interfaces and data elements, to adapt ERA now that the system has moved out of initial development and into the operations and maintenance phase. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."
M. F. Duarte Tavares,2012,Digital preservation: Between memory and history,"The digital preservation subject emerges from the very dominance of electronic media and its transversality in daily practices and in all dimensions of life. Currently, and differently from other memory preservation policies, emphasis is placed on supporting technologies and their possibilities of undifferentiated reproduction. Two standpoints of preservation are discussed, one referring to the use of digital technologies to preserve and disseminate content originally contained on material supports, therefore treated as documents, and the second that deals with the profuse production of digital information in computerized systems, on personal computers or mobile devices, which will be unrecoverable in the future due to the very technological obsolescence of the media in which the information was generated. In both approaches, the role of public and private institutions in ensuring the preservation of memory in digital media is emphasized, in a context of dispersed ownership of locally produced content and the redefinition of standards, values and social and cultural fabric that linked memory and identity in the past. We observe that the possible uses of information deposited in databases of memory institutions extrapolate the prospects of their restricted use as documents belonging to the past, as they may provide new interpretations and sometimes redirect long-term processes."
M. Galindo,2012,The pharmacon dilemma,"This paper explores the theoretical and methodological problems related to the application of digital preservation strategies. The analysis was based on data from the nationwide scientific research Preservation of digital memory: a Brazilian overview, an initiative which aimed to develop a map-diagnosis of the working practices on digital preservation in Institutional Repositories managed by universities and research centers in Brazil. In 2010, as an extension of this research initiative, the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) approved the research project Threatened Digital Heritage that intended to develop a theoretical model to analyze the risk associated with management, handling and preservation of digital assets. The paper focuses on the study of methodologies of Risk Analysis and its adaptation to digital information stock analysis, as well as promotes a theoretical discussion of epistemological principles that helped support the research."

M. Gibbs; S. Colley,2012,"Digital Preservation,: Online access and historical archaeology 'grey literature' from New South Wales, Australia","The New South Wales Archaeology Online (NSW AOL) Project aims to enhance the research, professional and educational value of archaeological information by using digital technology. Stages 1 and 2 (2009-13) involve collaboration with the University of Sydney Library eScholarship Repository and archaeologists studying colonial historic places and archaeological sites in New South Wales. So far the project has collected and digitised over 1000 hard-copy reports produced mainly before the mid 1990s that document previously unpublished heritage consultancy projects and student research. This 'grey literature' is being archived and content made publicly accessible online. The first version of the current NSW AOL sustainable digital archive was launched in March 2011 at http://nswaol.library.usyd.edu.au. This is designed to support preservation of digital content into the future, despite technology change, and is linked to a website with full-text search functionality and facetted-browsing that provides online access to over 600 PDF versions of digitised hard-copy reports. Stage 2 (2011-3) will archive and make further, and different kinds of, information accessible. Here we explain the background to the NSW AOL Project and our approach to creating a sustainable, scalable and interoperable digital archive and online publication. We outline the limits and future potential of the current digital tools and discuss key issues about digital preservation and online access facing archaeology in many countries, including Australia.© Australian Archaeological Association Inc., 2012."
M. Guttenbrunner; A. Rauber,2012,A measurement framework for evaluating emulators for digital preservation,"Accessible emulation is often the method of choice for maintaining digital objects, specifically complex ones such as applications, business processes, or electronic art. However, validating the emulator's ability to faithfully reproduce the original behavior of digital objects is complicated. This article presents an evaluation framework and a set of tests that allow assessment of the degree to which system emulation preserves original characteristics and thus significant properties of digital artifacts. The original system, hardware, and software properties are described. Identical environment is then recreated via emulation. Automated user input is used to eliminate potential confounders. The properties of a rendered form of the object are then extracted automatically or manually either in a target state, a series of states, or as a continuous stream. The concepts described in this article enable preservation planners to evaluate how emulation affects the behavior of digital objects compared to their behavior in the original environment. We also review how these principles can and should be applied to the evaluation of migration and other preservation strategies as a general principle of evaluating the invocation and faithful rendering of digital objects and systems. The article concludes with design requirements for emulators developed for digital preservation tasks. © 2012 ACM."
M. Guttenbrunner; A. Rauber,2012,Evaluating emulation and migration: Birds of a feather?,"Evaluating the results of a digital preservation action, be it migration or emulation, is a complex task. The usual approach for migration is to evaluate object properties after the migration. For emulation strategies the result of the rendering of the object is evaluated. In this paper we argue that the change of object properties when migrating is not sufficient evidence if a digital preservation action is successful or not. Even for migration the rendering process of the digital object is crucial, and as such evaluating object properties is not enough. The difference in evaluation between emulation and migration as a strategy for digital preservation becomes blurred as migration results have to be compared based on the rendering of the target format and the environment used to render the migrated digital object. Evaluation of object properties when migrating will only validate a necessary condition for preserving significant properties, i.e. whether the information underlying a specific property is still present in an object after migration. It cannot guarantee that the rendering based upon the migrated object will exhibit a specific significant property. In this paper we show the view-path of digital objects and explain how emulation and migration actions affect it. We then compare the changes that occur in the view-path and show that these are at least as severe when migrating a digital object as when emulating its rendering environment. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."

M. Kallberg,2012,Archivists 2.0: Redefining the archivist's profession in the digital age,"Purpose: Public organizations are investing in e-government development and e-services to improve the interaction and services to the citizens. Archivists need to act more pro-active to capture and manage records in order to be accessible both in the present and in the long-term. Archivists need to understand the conceptual context and business processes in which the records are created. This study aims to focus on an ongoing process within a specific context, which may have direct, but also future implications for archivists' professional identity. Professional identity is understood as a sense of shared understandings and skills, experiences, common way of perceiving problems and their possible solutions. The study is meant to answer the overall research question and sub-questions: What is the status of archivist professionals' positions and practice within public organizations? What organizational effect has the change from paper-based to electronic record keeping had on archivists' professional positions and practice within organizations? How do archivists perceive themselves in their professional roles, i.e. identity? Are there any critical competence issues that need to be solved that are connected to new requirements in working methods related to electronic record keeping? and How do archivists define their skills and working performance? Design/methodology/approach: The data presented and analyzed in this article are based on a literature review and an empirical study. The literature covers areas related to archivists' professional practice and future role. The empirical study is based on interviews with nine municipality archivists at nine different Swedish municipalities identified by the Swedish Association of Local Government and Regions as good example"" e-government municipalities. All interviews were undertaken during January and March 2011. Findings: The findings provide information on how archivists define their current and future professional role in relation to the organization and the development of information technology: the status of archivist professionals' positions and practice, for example, within public organizations. It explores the importance of strategic approaches to managing electronic records - from their creation throughout their whole existence, including long-term preservation - and considers necessary changes to the professional image of archivists and the skills they need. Originality/value: This article will be of interest to record keeping practitioners working in the shift to e-government in local contexts and also to educators, as there appears to be a shift in the skills and knowledge required by those working in local government. © ."""
M. Kastellec,2012,Practical limits to the scope of digital preservation,"This paper examines factors that limit the ability of institutions to digitally preserve the cultural heritage of the modern era. The author takes a wide-ranging approach to shed light on limitations to the scope of digital preservation. The author finds that technological limitations to digital preservation have been addressed but still exist, and that non-technical aspects-access, selection, law, and finances-move into the foreground as technological limitations recede. The author proposes a nested model of constraints to the scope of digital preservation and concludes that costs are digital preservation's most pervasive limitation."

M. Seadle,2012,Archiving in the digital world: The scholarly literature,"Purpose: The purpose of this article is an ethnographic description of a particular slice of the digital archiving scholarship. The point is to get a sense of where the library and information science profession is today in dealing with the issues of long-term digital archiving. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology comes from cultural anthropology. It looks at a particular virtual place (ProQuest's Library and Information Science Abstracts database), a particular time period (2000-2012) and a particular set of authors writing about digital archiving. Findings: The topics of migration, emulation, integrity, authenticity, LOCKSS and Portico have limited resonance among the authors in LISA in the last dozen years. Articles about repositories and metadata are more common. Technical topics in digital archiving may be better suited to a computer science database, though this is surprising considering how information science borders on computer science. LISA remains, at least as far as digital archiving is concerned, strongly library oriented. Practical implications: The digital archiving community that LISA reflects and represents is a community with a concern about the long-term future, but one that has not come to terms with the core technical issues necessary to enable content to survive in a useful form over long periods. Originality/value: This paper investigates the issues of long-term digital archiving from the perspective of the library and information science profession by examining a particular database, time period and set of authors on the topic. © ."
M. Seadle,2012,Archiving in the networked world: Authenticity and integrity,"Purpose: This article aims to discuss how concepts from the analog world apply to a purely digital environment, and look in particular at how authenticity needs to be viewed in the digital world in order to make some form of validation possible. Design/methodology/approach: The article describes authenticity and integrity in the analog world and looks at how to measure it in a digital environment. Findings: Authenticity in the digital world generally means, in a purely technical sense, that a document's integrity has been checked using mathematical algorithms against other copies on independently managed servers, and that provenance records show that the document has a clearly established succession from a clearly defined original. Readers should recognize that this is different than how one defines authenticity and integrity in the analog world. Originality/value: Most of the key issues surrounding digital authenticity have not yet been tested, but they will be when the economic value of an authentic digital work reaches the courts. © ."
M. Seadle; C. Lynch; E. Greifeneder,2012,Interactions between libraries and technology over the past 30 years:An interview with Clifford Lynch 23.06.2012,"The purpose of this paper is to look back on the last 30 years of technology development for libraries. The paper presents an interview that took place at the American Library Association Annual Meeting in Anaheim, California. The paper reveals that many of the developments are slow. There are very few really sudden revolutions in social-scale technologies. They do not switch on quickly and cannot be sudden because the installed base is too thin. The paper reveals that there should be some renewed conversation about how libraries can help the public. In the early days of the internet libraries played an enormous uncredited role in teaching the adult population about the internet. There are some opportunities like that now, and one place where we are starting to see signs of it is digital preservation, not as libraries doing it for the cultural record, but helping individuals to do it for their own content. © 2012, "

M. Weppler-Selear,2012,Digital curation of the Henry O. Nightingale diaries,"This paper details the University of California Merced Library's digital curation of two diaries written between the years of 1864 and 1865 by a Union soldier and abolitionist named Henry O. Nightingale. The Library first learned of the diaries' through communication with a historian named Steve Nagy. Nagy, along with two of his family members, had inherited letters that were written by Nightingale to a female ancestor during 1865. In 2008, while one of the letters was being transcribed, a passage revealed a claim by Nightingale of having procured a signature from Abraham Lincoln shortly before the President's assassination. Curious to learn more, Nagy eventually located Nightingale's descendants, Edith and Mel Denio, in Atwater, California. The Denios were in possession of the two diaries referenced above, and entrusted digitization of these two documents to the UC Merced Library in late 2009. While the Lincoln autograph has not been substantiated, the diaries nonetheless provide fascinating details of the latter period of the American Civil War; the 1864 diary includes accounts of Union regimental movement along with a description of Nightingale's injury from rebel fire during the Battle of the Wilderness. The 1865 diary includes a first-hand account of President Lincoln's assassination at Ford's Theatre. Following digitization of the diaries, library student workers were enlisted in curation activities to create the complex digital object records using Archivists' Toolkit, an open source digital management tool. Ingestion of the digital files into the UC Data Curation Repository, Merritt, involved an innovative automated process in which an initiated URL comprised of an XML file could extract the diaries' digital files from the server and ingest them directly into the repository. Student workers were also trained to assist with the transcription of both diaries, an activity that has greatly enhanced the metadata in the collection's finding aid. The ultimate goal of the project was to make the finding aid and associated complex digital objects freely accessible to the public through the Online Archive of California and Calisphere.

P. C. Franks; G. C. Oliver,2012,Experiential learning and international collaboration opportunities: Virtual internships,"Purpose: Experiential learning incorporated into library and information science education in the form of a practical placement has long been accepted as important. However, it is not always possible for students to undertake a traditional internship because of constraints associated with the physical location of internship sites. The purpose of this paper is to explore virtual alternatives, in the context of digital curation. Design/methodology/approach: Surveys exploring the internship experience were conducted of students and supervisors, leading to the development of a pilot study. In addition, discussions were held with possible supervisors in a country with a small population, faced with the challenge of building capability in digital curation. Findings: The concept of a virtual internship is entirely appropriate given the focus on digital tools, information and systems in digital curation. A new dimension to the traditional internship experience is the potential for sharing expertise internationally, in diverse settings. Research limitations/implications: Although the paper describes activities taking place through the School of Library & Information Science at San Jose State University, the findings can be used to justify virtual internship programs and develop strategies to be employed by other Schools at the University and other Universities within and outside the USA. Practical implications: This paper includes implications for the development of successful virtual internship programs on the Master's degree level, including those for students preparing for careers in digital curation. Originality/value: The paper provides insight into the practical issues associated with incorporating experiential learning into digital curation curricula and signals the potential for approaching internships from a global perspective. © ."
P. Gust,2012,Using a digital preservation system to ensure access to online digital content,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the benefits of integrating a digital preservation system into the library as a way to ensure uninterrupted access to e-journals and e-books. Design/methodology/approach: This paper introduces the concept of a digital preservation system, and shows how it can made to benefit end-users through a simple integration with the online pubic access catalogue (OPAC), to ensure continuous access to a library's e-journals and e-books. Findings: A digital preservation system ensures that libraries continue to have access to on-line assets once a subscription is cancelled or the publisher discontinues access. It extends the traditional library model of print journals and books on the shelf to encompass digital media. Providing end-user access to preserved content can be simplified by integrating the online public access catalogue (OPAC) with the digital preservation system through a link resolver. End-users can access the preserved content using an interface they already know, and the integration guards against publisher outages to provide continuous access to the library's digital collection. Practical implications: The techniques shown in this paper can be extended to integrating digital preservation systems with other library systems. Originality/value: This paper illustrates a simple way for the library to ensure that end-users have un-interrupted access to digital assets, even if it is necessary to cancel a subscription or there is a temporary disruption in service from the publisher. © ."

The term heritage"" is used broadly to include scientific and scholarly publications and data. Although the preservation of heritage is generally seen as inherently ""good,"" this activity implies the exercise of difficult moral choices. The ethical complexity of the preservation of digital heritage is illustrated by means of two hypothetical cases. The first deals with the harvesting and preservation in a wealthy country of political websites originating in a less affluent country. The second deals with a project initiated by a wealthy country to digitize the cultural heritage of a less affluent country. The ethical reflection that follows is structured within the framework of social justice and a set of information rights that are identified as corollaries of generally recognized human rights. The main moral agents, that is, the parties that have an interest, and may be entitled to exercise rights, in relation to digital preservation, are identified. The responsibilities that those who preserve digital content have toward these parties, and the political-economic considerations that arise, are then analyzed. © 2012 ASIS&T."""

Existing preservation systems have a strong focus on Grids, but the advent of cloud technologies offers an attractive option. We describe a middleware system that enables a flexible choice between a Grid and a cloud for ad-hoc computations that arise during the execution of a preservation workflow and also for archiving digital objects. The choice between different infrastructures remains open during the lifecycle of the archive, ensuring a smooth switch between different solutions to accommodate the changing requirements of the organization that needs its digital assets preserved. We also offer insights on the costs, running times, and organizational issues of cloud computing, proving that the cloud alternative is particularly attractive for smaller organizations without access to a Grid or with limited IT infrastructure. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

A new problem in the digital universe has arisen: Digital Preservation. This chapter addresses the problems of Digital Preservation and focuses on the conceptual model within a specific class of digital objects: Relational Databases. Previously, a neutral format was adopted to pursue the goal of platform independence and to achieve a standard format in the digital preservation of relational databases, both data and structure (logical model). The authors address the preservation of relational databases by focusing on the conceptual model of the database, considering the database semantics as an important preservation property."" For the representation of this higher layer of abstraction present in databases, they use an ontology-based approach. At this higher abstraction level exists inherent Knowledge associated to the database semantics that the authors tentatively represent using ""Web Ontology Language"" (OWL). From the initial prototype, they develop a framework (supported by case studies) and establish a mapping algorithm for the conversion between databases and OWL. The ontology approach is adopted to formalize the knowledge associated to the conceptual model of the database and also a methodology to create an abstract representation of it. The system is based on the functional axes (ingestion, administration, dissemination, and preservation) of the OAIS reference model. © 2013, IGI Global."""
R. Altenhöner,2012,Tailoring digital preservation services for practice: Workflow development and cost modeling,"The introduction of digital preservation services into the operations of institutions where existing workflow processes are established affects the process infrastructure in many ways. This leads in itself to mutual adaptation needs. If not only internal but also external organisational units are involved and that is often unavoidable in a complex process such as the long-term preservation-the importance of a comprehensive service including an advanced organisational solution and a cost model is striking. Against this background, it is necessary to bring together technology and organisation and to anchor in a holistic approach operational aspects of digital preservation and its organisational embeddedness in institutions. Of course needs that are stated in a theoretical manner require practical implementation. Reflecting the history of workflow implementation in the German National Library some central needs and results from these experiences are presented. The new workflow for mass ingest of digital publications integrates requirements from the digital preservation unit in the broader scope of ingest routines and showcases the demand for modular and generic components, which can be integrated in the IT-infrastructure of a library. Results from the project DP4lib show in addition how a service-oriented infrastructure for digital preservation services can be established. By implementing the project was learned that much more important than technical tools is the workflow-related work, and here especially quality assurance, verifiable processes, predictable costs, reliable reporting, and documentation of history. © 2012, DESIDOC."
R. Buckley,2012,Error correction and recovery of JPEG 2000 compressed images in digital preservation,"Several studies originating in the cultural heritage community have looked at the robustness of compressed image files in the face of bit errors. Some but not all have concluded that image compression adds to the risk of file loss so much so that it is best avoided. These are legitimate concerns, not just for compressed image data, but in the transmission and storage of any digital data. The use of error correction technology significantly reduces and in some cases effectively eliminates these risks and with them the specific concerns around the use of compression. A system designer has a wide range of options for error detection, recovery and correction, some of which would apply to any digital data and others which are tailored to the specific characteristics of JPEG 2000-compressed image streams in both transmission and storage scenarios. The conclusion is that it is possible to manage the bit error rate in the components of a digital preservation system so that the corruption of compressed image files, or of any files for that matter, due to bit errors is not a significant issue. ©2012 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

Yet, due to the complexity of typical MIR experiments, ensuring the capability of re-running any experiment, achieving exactly identical outputs is challenging at best. Performance differences observed may be attributed to incomplete documentation of the process, slight variations in data (preprocessing) or software libraries used, and others. Digital preservation aims at keeping digital objects authentically accessible and usable over long time spans. While traditionally focussed on individual objects, research is now moving towards the preservation of entire processes.

Van Diest,2012,Digital slide images for primary diagnostics in breast pathology: a feasibility study,"Digital slide images have been used in many areas of pathology such as teaching, research, digital archiving, teleconsultation, and quality assurance testing. However, they have not much been used as yet for upfront diagnostics. The aim of this study was therefore to test the feasibility of digital slide image-based diagnosis of breast specimens. Sections of 100 breast specimens previously diagnosed conventionally were scanned and rediagnosed on digital slide images by the same pathologists who performed the initial light microscopy-based diagnosis. The digital slide image diagnoses were compared with the light microscopy diagnoses and classified as concordant, slightly discrepant (without clinical or prognostic consequences), or discrepant. The original light microscopy- and digital slide image-based diagnoses were concordant in 93% and slightly discrepant in 6% of cases. There was only I discrepant case with clinical or prognostic implication to the patient. However, for this case, no final agreement could be achieved. For 4 of the 6 slightly discrepant cases, digital slide image diagnosis was considered the better one, whereas the original diagnosis was preferred in only 1 case. In addition, for 1 case categorized as slightly discrepant, both the digital slide image and conventional diagnosis were imperfect according to 2 reviewing breast pathologists. This study demonstrates that upfront histopathologic diagnosis of breast biopsies and resections can reliably be done on digital slide image. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

S. Chandra; P. A. Gokhale,2012,Implementing open archival information system model for digital preservation at Indian institute of Geomagnetism,"The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model ensures that an organisation charged with the task of preserving information (here, digital information) makes it accessible to the designated community in the long-term. It elucidates the functions and processes so as to promote interoperability amongst digital libraries, archives and other institutions and provides a framework for describing and comparing different long-term digital preservation strategies and techniques. This paper discusses what it means to be OAIS compliant for the pilot institutional repository at the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG). It maps the six entities of an OAIS-compliant repository (Ingest, archival storage, administration, data management, preservation planning and access) onto a pilot institutional repository (IR) structure of the IIG. It discusses the policies and procedures required for effective OAIS implementation within the IIG institutional repository and ways to effectively develop these based on experiences from abroad. The paper further assesses how the institute's operational structure can be informed by the OAIS and vice versa. It establishes the role of the preservation service provider for the IIG IR, and explores the potential for interaction between IIG and such service providers.It identifies the rights and responsibilities, services and actions, and apportions these between the IR and the third-party preservation repository service. It identifies the tools and develops the processes to implement the preservation services and actions. It is expected that this study can be of use to other organisations that might want to undertake implementation of the OAIS reference model. © 2012, DESIDOC."

Finkle,2012,Combining X-ray micro-CT technology and 3D printing for the digital preservation and study of a 19th century cantonese chess piece with intricate internal structure,"Laser scanning has been widely adopted for the digital preservation and study of cultural heritage artifacts. However, surface scans alone are not sufficient for a variety of intricate objects such as the Cantonese chess pieces that were delicately carved from ivory throughout the 19th Century. These pieces incorporate a puzzle ball base, which is comprised of several balls, one inside the other. In this project we explore the use of x-ray micro-CT technology to scan the piece with a voxel separation of less than 9 μm, By using masking and editing software we generate 3D surface models of the separate parts to enable close inspection of both exterior and interior sections. Visualizing the dataset at a much larger scale enables the viewer to appreciate the fine surface details imperceivable in the original piece. Finally, 3D scaled versions are printed where the small details are also easily observed and the inner balls within the puzzle ball base move freely . The work flow demonstrated in this article has important possibilities in digital preservation, documentation, and presentation. © 2012 ACM."
S. Jeffrey,2012,"A new Digital Dark Age? Collaborative web tools, social media and long-term preservation","This paper examines the impact of exciting new approaches to open data sharing, collaborative web tools and social media on the sustainability of archaeological data. The archiving, reuse and re-analysis of data is often considered intrinsic to archaeological practice, not least because of the destructive nature of excavation. The idea that the pace of adoption of new digital technologies can outstrip the development of the infrastructure required for sustainable access to its outputs, ultimately leading to the loss of data, is sometimes referred to as the 'Digital Dark Age' problem. While strenuous efforts have been made to address this issue, the recent rapid uptake of a new wave of tools to enhance access, promote wider dialogue and gather data has the potential to recreate this problem. This is particularly true because of the volatile technical, legal and commercial contexts in which much of this work takes place. This paper explores these problems, discusses potential changes in the nature of archaeological dialogue and information sharing, and posits solutions that might mitigate a second 'Digital Dark Age'. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

S. M. Morrissey; S. Society for Imaging; Technology,2012,The Network is the Format: PDF and the Longterm Use of Digital Content,"The Association for Library Collections and Technical Services (ALCTS) defines the goal of digital preservation as the accurate rendering of authenticated content over time."" To that end, the preservation community has delineated a set of possible approaches (migration, emulation, digital archaeology) to ensure fidelity in rendering, and has developed converging lists of recommended formats for different uses (text, still image, sound, moving image, etc.).Featuring prominently in many such lists is the PDF family of formats. Although it is a commercially developed format, it is widely seen as meeting many of the requirements deemed critical to reducing risk to the long-term viability of a format: it is in wide-spread use; there are many implementations, some of them open-source, of viewer applications; there is a publicly available specification of the format, control of which has been ceded to a public standards body (ISO). Further, there is ongoing work, under the ISO umbrella, to develop an ""archiving"" profile of PDF (ISO-190005), intended ""to define a file format based on PDF, known as PDF/A, which provides a mechanism for representing electronic documents in a manner that preserves their static visual appearance over time, independent of the tools and systems used for creating, storing or rendering the files.""It is the thesis of this paper that these attributes of PDF, the admirable move by Adobe to place the specification of the format under non-commercial control, and even the developing of specifications for an archiving profile of the format, while necessary, are an insufficient warrant for the long-term usability of PDF instances. Further, the reasons why this is so clarify our understanding of what is required fully to characterize a file format. These reasons suggest that the current direction of the development of the PDF/A archiving profile may, ironically, constitute a significant departure from the warranties implicit in terming PDF/A an archival format. These reasons suggest that we not only must characterize a format instance, we must also characterize format renderers. They suggest that such anatomies of the ""rendition stack"" are important, not just for those who contemplate a strategy of emulation for re-enacting the original experience of an object's rendition, but also for the as-yet unanticipated uses, beyond ""fidelity in rendering"", of the digital objects we preserve. They put in relief the challenges of encapsulation, or even multiple possible encapsulations, of a sufficient sub-graph of the network of information about a digital object, for effective future use."""

Yet, research into their long-term viability and the meaningful accessibility of their contents remains in its infancy. In general, as we have pointed out elsewhere, after more than twenty years of research in digital curation and preservation the actual theories, methods and technologies that can either foster or ensure digital longevity remain startlingly limited. Research led by DigitalPreservationEurope (DPE) and the Digital Preservation Cluster of DELOS has allowed us to refine the key research challenges-theoretical, methodological and technological-that need attention by researchers in digital libraries during the coming five to ten years, if we are to ensure that the materials held in our emerging digital libraries are to remain sustainable, authentic, accessible and understandable over time. Building on this work and taking the theoretical framework of archival science as bedrock, this article investigates digital preservation and its foundational role if digital libraries are to have long-term viability at the center of the global information society.

The hybrid cloud services integrate external commercial cloud services with internal IT infrastructure, which has been adapted to provide cloud-like interfaces. The system provides services to manage and process research outputs, primarily focusing on research data. These services include both repository services, based on use of the Fedora Commons repository, as well as common services such as preservation operations that are provided by cloud compute services. Kindura is piloting the use of the DuraCloud, open source software developed by DuraSpace, to provide a common interface to interact with cloud storage and compute providers. A storage broker integrates with DuraCloud to optimise the usage of available resources, taking into account such factors as cost, reliability, security and performance.

They abandon generality to increase expressiveness and ease of use. DSLs are an useful alternative to general-purpose languages, but their appropriateness and profitableness should be carefully considered. In this paper the utilisation of DSL knowledge to improve digital preservation practices is elaborated, which leads to the following results: A DSL for emulator development reduces implementation effort and increases comprehensibility and durability. The DSL XML provides format standardisation for information stored in plain text. A DSL especially for the domain digital preservation is not practicable and digital pre-servation is better supported by the right mix of DSLs. The results are particularly interesting from a knowledge-management perspective since gathered knowledge should be preserved."
T. Hyla; I. El Fray; W. MaćKów; J. Pejaś,2012,Long-term preservation of digital signatures for multiple groups of related documents,"Increasing numbers of documents are currently being stored in electronic archives. These documents are often digitally signed to ensure non-repudiation. However, the term of validity of digital signatures is usually only 2 years, so the archive must extend their validity to the required storage period. The simplest solution to this problem is to use XAdES-A specification and process each signed document separately. Such an approach requires the creation of a timestamp for each signed document. This time stamping operation is very time consuming; therefore several improved techniques have been proposed, for example, evidence record syntax (ERS). The documents in an archive are often related to one entity. The ERS allows us to prove the existence of a document group in one round. This study presents a solution extending ERS and providing a functionality that enables proof of the existence of a document group over a long period (multiple rounds). © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology."

However, while the vast amounts of information continue to occur, human beings are persecuted by the loss of information, especially those carrying human culture and civilization. The prolonged preservation technology of digital content faces enormous challenges. Therefore, the managers should consider how to supervise, manage and utilize the digital content for a long time by the scientific and reasonable measures. OAIS provides a conceptual model for the long-term preservation of digital content, it satisfy the basic need of the long-term preservation of digital content from the aspect of system function. But in the practice of preservation, the explicit data model is necessary, moreover, the model should meet the management need of whole life cycle in the long-term preservation of digital content, meanwhile it's necessary to choose the coding formats of media files. In this paper, firstly, we study the digital content management data model and propose a 7-layer reference model of digital content management according to the hierarchical idea. And then using data mining techniques, we implicit in all the associated data layer data extraction, comparison, analysis, and selectively format digital information for maintenance and preservation according to the appropriate standards.

This is not only attributed to the rich show force of the 3D models, but also compensates the disadvantages of image and video multimedia resources such as information sharing, storage, and display. For model management and retrieval, and other issues brought about by the massive growth of 3D model in the field of digital preservation of cultural relics, a method of ontology-based 3D relics model retrieval was proposed. First, the 3D models were classified, and the attribute information of the model and the relationship between the concept of cultural relics were built. Second, the relationship between the ontologies was used to establish the rules and the semantic network. Third, the semantic ontology reasoning system was generated. Last, the system for quick and accurate retrieval of the 3D models was implemented. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better results than traditional methods."

The mammoth size of the issue of saving CAD/BIM files requires a multi-step plan that effectively, but gradually, addresses the layers of complications this effort will unfurl. The first step is to create an inclusive bibliography of past, current and scheduled future projects that address the legal, technical and curatorial complexities of CAD/BIM files. Recognizing the complexity and wide-reaching nature of born-digital architectural records, the Society of American Archivists (SAA) Architectural Records Roundtable created a CAD/BIM Taskforce in August 2012, at the SAA's Annual Conference.

Despite the artworks complexity, this approach allows great insight into the artwork composition and alteration phases. However, difficulties arise from the great amount of heterogeneous interconnected data that has to be stored for a prompt analysis and preserved. A suitable tool to handle and analyse all the information on the fly is therefore crucial to optimize work, specially in in situ investigations. In this paper we present MOVIDA, a new tool for the data management and analysis of non-invasive investigations in the Cultural Heritage field that not only allows the digital preservation of all the information and knowledge, but can also be used as an analytical tool while the investigation is being developed. The software can be installed on any computer to record, elaborate and analyse the data on-the-spot. All the data generated can be managed within the same application and the information can be easily consulted, compared and related to the corresponding areas of the artwork. The software is self-comprehensive and user-friendly and can be used by all the professionals involved in the investigation and preservation of Cultural Heritage whatever their background and computer skills are. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS."
A. Bachmann; M. A. Neumann; H. Miri; J. Barateiro; G. Antunes; A.

This paper investigates the problem of digitally preserving monitoring processes of a dam safety information system. Monitoring processes are a crucial element in ensuring structural safety; the interpretation of the past data produced by such processes as well as the prediction of potential future behaviour facilitates an earlier detection of possible dam failure. After a successful preservation performance, relevant data can be used or re-produced without the need for the original system to still exist; merely by re-playing the preserved information and data. This enables several possibilities in the scope of a water dam system. The retracing of former situations and structural behaviour decades later is one of them. Furthermore, the interpretation of past data and subsequent prediction of future behaviour that could facilitate an earlier detection of a fault or possible dam failure. This work presents a methodology for preserving the obtained sensor data (readings, measurements, and meta-data) from a dam safety information system, whose involved processes include: data acquisition, the preservation process itself, and the re-playing and redeployment of the preserved data."

Soga Library in the digital preservation of South African veterinary history,"The history of veterinary science in South Africa can only be appreciated, studied, researched and passed on to coming generations if historical sources are readily available. In most countries, material and sources with historical value are often difficult to locate, dispersed over a large area and not part of the conventional book and journal literature. The Faculty of Veterinary Science of the University of Pretoria and its library has access to a large collection of historical sources. The collection consists of photographs, photographic slides, documents, proceedings, posters, audio-visual material, postcards and other memorabilia. Other institutions in the country are also approached if relevant sources are identified in their collections. The University of Pretoria's institutional repository, UPSpace, was launched in 2006. This provided the Jotello F. Soga Library with the opportunity to fill the repository with relevant digitised collections of diverse heritage and learning resources that can contribute to the long-term preservation and accessibility of historical veterinary sources. These collections are available for use not only by historians and researchers in South Africa but also elsewhere in Africa and the rest of the world. Important historical collections such as the Arnold Theiler collection, the Jotello F. Soga collection and collections of the Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research and the Journal of the South African Veterinary Association are highlighted. The benefits of an open access digital repository, the importance of collaboration across the veterinary community and other prerequisites for the sustainability of a digitisation project and the importance of metadata to enhance accessibility are covered."

Results indicate that students perceived increases in their understanding of and interest in LGBT history and issues. This study has implications for further partnerships between archivists and educators."
A. Collie; D. Higgins; L. Mak; S. Nicholson,2013,Accumulating metadata from tributary workflows for more robust archival records,"Metadata generation oftentimes involves not just a single source but rather a tributary system of interoperating technical processes and workflows during capture. New methods of capture such as automated extraction of technical metadata creates a more robust archival record that will improve our ability to curate digital objects. Recent development roadmaps from two well regarded open source digital preservation systems envision an integration of the Archivematica digital preservation system to prepare information packages for management and dissemination via the Fedora Commons middleware application. MSU Libraries recently piloted a proof-of-technology to transform the technical metadata output from the File Information Tool Set (FITS) utilized by Archivematica for ingesting into a Fedora Common installation. This is accomplished by transforming the metadata output of the open-source Archivematica digital preservation system into the Fedora Commons extension of METS. This interactive paper will report on possible scenarios for the integration of these two preservation tools including the management of the resultant AIP and DIP; possible changes to metadata generation, indexing and searching; as well as provide observation on the applicability to similar workflows. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."
A. Dappert; S. Peyrard; C. C. H. Chou; J. Delve,2013,Describing and preserving digital object environments,"A digital object is not usable without a computing environment in which it can be rendered or executed. If we want to ensure the long-term usability of digital objects, so that they can be used in the face of changing formats, software, and hardware, it is necessary to either preserve their computing environments or to, at least, gather enough information, so that the computing environment can be reconstructed or adapted to a changed world. Digital preservation metadata is the information that is needed in order to preserve digital objects successfully in the long-term so that they can be deployed in some form in the future. Information that describes the sufficient components of the digital object's computing environment has to be part of its preservation metadata. Although there are semantic units for recording environment information in the de-facto standard for digital preservation metadata, PREMIS, these semantic units have rarely, if ever, been used. Prompted by increasing interest in the description of computing environments, this article describes requirements and solution proposals for defining an improved metadata description for computing environments. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

A. Smith,2013,What can we afford to lose?,"As the intellectual and creative output of humankind grows exponentially, the burden of ensuring long-term access to information and cultural artifacts increases. Traditional means of conservation and preservation will continue to play a vital role in preserving artifactual collections, even as funding for these activities erodes. The strategies for digital preservation are not as well articulated: we are devising technical solutions to longevity, but the ultimate solutions will demand a type and degree of cooperation among libraries, museum, and archives that is unprecedented. This paper addresses the difficult choices that institutions and individuals face when taking action to preserve. It proposes a model for assessing what the value of collections is to the institution and its constituents, how that value changes over time, and how new technologies for creating, disseminating, and preserving information and cultural objects are changing our sense of the intrinsic value of library collections. Finally, the paper examines the critical issue of how we can measure our return on investment in preservation."
A. Stauder,2013,"2012 survey of the preservation, management, and use of audiovisual media in European higher education institutions","Purpose: The author conducted a survey with regard to the situation of audiovisual media in European higher education, with regard to quantities, storage conditions, digitisation, and digital preservation of audiovisual media, and attitudes towards these topics. This paper aims to document the findings. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 226 of around 800 addressed institutions in 33 European states filled in an online questionnaire. Findings: The picture that presents itself is a very diverse one with a variety of content lifecycle stages, types of content and data carriers, and attitudes. Information regarding collections is often fragmentary: there were even contradictory statements from the same organisations, and only 50 percent of the responding institutions had detailed information on their collections. A correlation between lack of information and state of collections could be found: institutions that had thoroughly surveyed their collections often had repositories and dedicated considerable effort to digitisation and preservation. Practical implications: A definite need for digitisation and preservation could be confirmed. Extrapolating from the figures that were the outcome of the present survey, the hours of content existing in European higher education institutions can be expected to run well into the millions. In general, the field of digitisation and digital preservation of multimedia content in higher education could be found to be one that is still in a state of flux and more than superficial awareness of it is lower than could be expected in the information age. Originality/value: This is the first study on such a large scale to have been conducted on the subject of the preservation, management, and use of audiovisual media in European higher education. © ."
A. Wassmer; P. Fornaro; Is,2013,Monolith: Lessons Learned on the Way to the Market,"In 2006 the Imaging and Media Lab at the University of Basel started a first project called Peviar (Permanent Visual Archive) [1, 2]. The aim was to find a digital archival storage solution without the need of periodic migration. The basic approach was to store binary data as 2D barcode on micrographic film. The theoretical, promising results found in Peviar have been further developed. Two subsequent applied science projects concluded in a commercial product called Monolith, which was introduced on the market in 2008.Monolith is a workflow for migration-less preservation of digital data on optical media. It combines the permanence and visual nature of photographic material and the strength of digital imaging technology. The binary information is stored as bit pattern in 2D barcode either on one or multiple film layers. The machine readable code is enriched by human readable metadata in order to describe the archived objects. It also provides detailed descriptions of how to recover the original files. Because of the image based approach, the recovery is not affected by change of technology; digital cameras certainly will be available in the future. Moreover, they will become better and cheaper."

B. D. Lee; S. Rhyu; K. Park; J. Song,2013,Preservation of digital media based on embedded context and provenance information,"Recently, with accessible media, tools, and applications, a user has been able to create multimedia files without professional knowledge. A wide variety of multimedia file formats are available to meet different requirements. From the perspective of digital preservation and version management, however, most existing multimedia file formats have several shortcomings. For instance, there is no support for recovering damaged multimedia files using their derived files or a systematic comparison of content among derived files. In this paper, we propose a method to preserve multimedia files in such a way that individual files maintain preservation information along with multimedia data to keep track of change history. In order to show the feasibility of our approach, we extend the ISO base media file format on which various well-known media formats such as MP4 are based and analyze our approach in terms of storage consumption."

B. J. Daigle,2013,Dream the impossible dream: Born digital stewardship,"In 2009, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded a research project that sought to steward born digital archives as well as provide a methodology for others to do the same. Born Digital Materials: An Inter-Institutional Model for Stewardship (AIMS) is the result (http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/). A partnership among the Universities of Virginia, Hull (UK), Stanford, and Yale, this international partnership had thee main areas of focus: process eleven hybrid collections, cultivate a new community of digital archivists, and create a methodology that others could adapt to their local practices. This comprehensive methodology broke the complex workflows down into four main parts: collection development; accessioning; arrangement and description; and discovery and access. Each of these parts represents a highly complex and involved set of services. Each partner used the methodology on the various collections that were identified and also consulted with other libraries and archives across the globe. The result is a flexible framework that can be adapted to any level of organization. It presents a detailed decision tree that allows an archivist to work through the daunting task of stewarding born digital content. This past summer, the University of Virginia Library was able to test much of our methodology in our approach to capturing the historical events related to the resignation and reinstatement of UVa's President, Theresa Sullivan (http://sullivan.lib.virginia.edu/about/). These actions provided a unique and compelling opportunity for the library to demonstrate its leadership in this environment and forge new relationships with units across the university - all working together to provide a comprehensive archive of events as they unfolded. Born digital materials offer a unique challenge to any organization's digital preservation strategy and infrastructure. For example, there are serious tensions among keeping the original physical media, a forensic or logical disk image of its content, and what is ultimately archived. This content creates a labyrinth of ethics and infrastructure that anyone dealing with born digital materials must navigate. With the Sullivan Archive, we can add to that problem set, the myriad of third party agreements that must be taken into account before any of this content can be made available. In sum, born digital stewardship poses a series of questions that deeply disrupt the role of libraries and archives and the future of the historical record. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."
B. Martinez; C. Mitja; J. Escofet,2013,Optimization of digitization procedures in cultural heritage,"The digitization of both volumetric and flat objects is the nowadays-preferred method in order to preserve cultural heritage items. High quality digital files obtained from photographic plates, films and prints, paintings, drawings, gravures, fabrics and sculptures, allows not only for a wider diffusion and on line transmission, but also for the preservation of the original items from future handling. Early digitization procedures used scanners for flat opaque or translucent objects and camera only for volumetric or flat highly texturized materials. The technical obsolescence of the high-end scanners and the improvement achieved by professional cameras has result in a wide use of cameras with digital back to digitize any kind of cultural heritage item. Since the lens, the digital back, the software controlling the camera and the digital image processing provide a wide range of possibilities, there is necessary to standardize the methods used in the reproduction work leading to preserve as high as possible the original item properties. This work presents an overview about methods used for camera system characterization, as well as the best procedures in order to identify and counteract the effect of the lens residual aberrations, sensor aliasing, image illumination, color management and image optimization by means of parametric image processing. As a corollary, the work shows some examples of reproduction workflow applied to the digitization of valuable art pieces and glass plate photographic black and white negatives."
B. Oehlerts; S. Liu,2013,Digital preservation strategies at Colorado State University Libraries,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an account of digital archiving and preservation practices and processes successfully implemented at an academic institution. Design/methodology/approach: This case study chronicles the planning and actions taken to identify, select, package, and archive local digital assets for long-term access and migration. It includes a literature review and offers selected resources as a starting point for other institutions investigating digital preservation tools and practices. Findings: Digital preservation is a broad, evolving, and important facet of digital asset management, yet often overlooked by library administration and understated in library operations. Collaborative approaches should be considered in implementing digital preservation tools and processes with limited resources. Practical implications: What is successfully in operation at CSUL may be learned by other institutions. An effective preservation plan and established workflows will give an organization the capability to maximize limited funds and staff time. Originality/value: The majority of the current literature provides theories, technologies, conceptual models, and large-scale collaborations, with relatively little describing needs, practices, operations, and experiences at a specific academic library.

C. A. Fitzgerald; J. C.

Various digital storage media become unreadable as hardware upgrades continue at a rapid pace, often without regard to backward reading capability. This class of content often cannot support the expense of either regular migration to newer media formats or preservation on higher cost black and white separation film. Film is the only proven archival medium for motion images without the need for migration, accordingly Eastman Kodak utilized a unique and full systems approach to develop a color asset protection film for this at risk class of content. This paper will focus on the development of this KODAK Color Asset Protection Film 2332 which utilizes common digital post production house devices to record and store digitally processed images for long term preservation. Discussion will focus on formulation considerations to deliver improved dark stability performance while maintaining a significantly reduced cost versus current archival films, system design considerations, color and image quality management, in addition to workflow proposals for present day quality check and future restoration strategies. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""
C. A. Yano; Z. J. M. Shen; S. Chan,2013,Optimising the number of copies and storage protocols for print preservation of research journals,"Academic libraries are reducing their holdings of print journals as more of this material becomes available electronically. Our work was motivated by the desire of the management at JSTOR, a major electronic archive of research journals, to preserve clean copies that retain full information accuracy from the vantage point of the researcher, but the broader community of librarians at research libraries is extremely concerned about this issue as well. We present results of a research project designed to provide guidelines and insight to JSTOR management and to the community of librarians at research institutions in this context. As a prelude, we report briefly on statistical analysis of defects in the pages of 25 journals for their entire publication history. This provides a backdrop for our approach to the problem. We then present models for two storage protocols, both of which have the goal of finding minimum-cost or Pareto optimal policies for ensuring, with a high probability, survival of at least one copy for a specified time horizon. One protocol involves archiving only clean copies in a secure environment, and the second protocol is a hybrid approach that combines clean copies with backup copies that can be cleaned up to replace clean copies that are lost or damaged. We also discuss other domains where our methodology can be applied. © 2013 Taylor & Francis."
C. Becker; K. Duretec,2013,Free benchmark corpora for preservation experiments: Using model-driven engineering to generate data sets,"Digital preservation is an active area of research, and recent years have brought forward an increasing number of characterisation tools for the object-level analysis of digital content. However, there is a profound lack of objective, standardised and comparable metrics and benchmark collections to enable experimentation and validation of these tools. While fields such as Information Retrieval have for decades been able to rely on benchmark collections annotated with ground truth to enable systematic improvement of algorithms and systems along objective metrics, the digital preservation field is yet unable to provide the necessary ground truth for such benchmarks. Objective indicators, however, are the key enabler for quantitative experimentation and innovation. This paper presents a systematic model-driven benchmark generation framework that aims to provide realistic approximations of real-world digital information collections with fully known ground truth that enables systematic quantitative experimentation, measurement and improvement against objective indicators. We describe the key motivation and idea behind the framework, outline the technological building blocks, and discuss results of the generation of pagebased and hierarchical documents from a ground truth model. Based on a discussion of the benefits and challenges of the approach, we outline future work. Copyright © 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc. (ACM)."

The Luce Library is a highly specialized library in maritime collections; its holdings represent a well rounded collection with special strength in maritime engineering, naval architecture, marine transportation, oceanography, transportation economics and management. The Stephen B. Luce Library of SUNY Maritime College is nationally and internationally known for its rare collections and archival documents in maritime history dating as early as 1700's. The paper Digitizing Rare Maritime Collections"" demonstrates the work of the Stephen B. Luce Library of SUNY Maritime College in its efforts to digitize and promote rare maritime collections by providing access to researchers throughout the world. The paper describes the uniqueness of the SUNY Maritime College collections, it discusses the methodology for recruiting and acquiring rare maritime related historical resources, and gives reasons to the decision making process for prioritizing certain types of collections for digital archiving. The paper also addresses the technology implemented to digitize and make these historical collections searchable and accessible to researchers throughout the world. The specialized nature of the maritime historical collections housed at the Stephen B. Luce Library serve a variety of purposes: they provide legal, historic and evidentiary value to individuals and society as a whole. The collections document the maritime history of the Port of New York, historical aspects of New York City history, such as trade and transportation during the nineteen and twentieth century, immigration and water activity in the Eastern Seaboard. The scope of these special maritime collections include journals and proceedings of professional maritime organizations, such as the Marine Society of the City of New York and the Sailor's Snug Harbour, genealogical records, collections of journals reports, daybooks and personal letters, company documents of shipping companies and cruise liners such as the Grace Lines, White Star Lines and the Moore-McCormack Lines. In addition, the collections include artefacts from ships and life at sea, as well as detailing the history of ships and maritime activities during World War II. Most important are the collections pertaining to genealogical records of mariners and passenger manifests of ships arriving at the New York City harbour early 19th century. The paper demonstrates the efforts of the Stephen B. Luce Library, the in-house expertise and the project technology aspects related to digitize and secure long-term access to such rare maritime collections. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""

Tools, technology and formats become easily deprecated and replaced by others, and legal and licensing affairs are subject to constant legislation changes. Hence, a business seeking to preserve its assets for long term becomes very prone to problems of this nature.

C. H. Yu; J.

It also provides valuable information for ensuring the long-term preservation of cultural heritage artifacts. Consequently, as more museums develop online three-dimensional (3D) collections, curators and scholars are demanding online tools that enable them to document and interpret variances and similarities between related 3D digital objects. This article describes a system that was developed to enable museum curators and/or scholars to document relationships between multiple 3D digital representations of museum objects using web-based annotation tools. The 3D Semantic Association (3DSA) system enables users to annotate relationships between multiple whole objects, parts of objects, or features on objects (surface features or volumetric segments). The annotations are stored on a server in an interoperable format that can be shared, discovered, browsed, and retrieved through a web browser interface. This approach not only improves scholars' capabilities to undertake cultural heritage research but also enables researchers to document, share, discuss, and compare alternative hypotheses about the relationships between artifacts. © 2013 ACM 1556-4673/2013/11-ART16 15.00."

In this study the authors aim to provide insights into a firm's DP needs, capabilities and decision making mechanisms by conducting a multiple case study through the lens of organizational information processing theory. The results indicate that a lack of decision making procedures and responsibilities impedes the alignment between DP needs and capabilities, which seems to foster a culture of information hoarding.

Rogers,2013,Records in the Cloud - A Metadata Framework for Cloud Service Providers,"The Records in the Cloud project (http://recordsinthecloud.org/) involves exploring both the benefits and risks of the creation, use, management, storage, long-term preservation and access of records in the cloud"", or virtual computing infrastructure. The research seeks to weigh the risks versus benefits of keeping records in the cloud within Canadian legal, administrative and value systems by exploring questions of confidentiality, security, organizational forensic readiness, information governance, and the ability to prove records' evidentiary capacity by establishing their accuracy, reliability and authenticity. This poster will focus primarily on the project's initiative of establishing a framework for a standard of trust for the cloud, one that guarantees the authenticity, reliability and integrity of the data and records that users entrust to cloud infrastructures. The current goal is to work towards consolidating user interests into one trusted, standardized framework that could be applied by cloud providers as a best practice standard in the design of their infrastructure and the deployment of their services. In this poster we present preliminary results of our research into identifying the provisions that would need to be addressed within such a framework, such as questions of custody, control, and privacy, as well as of integrity, authenticity and reliability."""

Fontes,2013,Search the past with the portuguese web archive,"The web was invented to quickly exchange data between sci- entists, but it became a crucial communication tool to con- nect the world. However, the web is extremely ephemeral. Most of the information published online becomes quickly unavailable and is lost forever. There are several initiatives worldwide that struggle to archive information from the web before it vanishes. However, search mechanisms to access this information are still limited and do not satisfy their users who demand performance similar to live-web search engines. This demo presents the Portuguese Web Archive, which enables search over 1.2 billion files archived from 1996 to 2012. It is the largest full-text searchable web archive pub- licly available [17]. The software developed to support this service is also publicly available as a free open source project at Google Code, so that it can be reused and enhanced by other web archivists. A short video about the Portuguese Web Archive is available at vimeo.com/59507267. The ser- vice can be tried live at archive.pt."
D. Gugelmann; D. Schatzmann; V.

In contrast to classical network intrusion detection systems that keep only packet records of suspicious traffic (black-listing), Horizon Extender reduces the total size of captured network traces by filtering out all records that do not reveal potential evidence about leaked data (white-listing). Horizon Extender has been designed to exploit the inherent redundancy and adherence to protocol specification of general Web traffic. We show in a real-life network including more than 1000 active hosts that Horizon Extender is able to reduce the total HTTP volume by 99.8%, or the outgoing volume by 90.9% to 93.9%, while preserving sufficient evidence to recover retrospectively time, end point identity, and content of information leaked over the HTTP communication channel. © 2013 ACM."

I want to put digital preservation in the larger context of changes in scholarly communication and to argue that preservation is at the center of those changes and that preservationists should not shrink from but rather aspire to the high purpose of that central transforming role. Then I want to turn to some of the economic and political aspects of this emerging transformation. © 1995 Robert L. Oakley.
D. L. DeWitt,2013,"Going Digital: Strategies for Access, Preservation, and Conversion of Collections to a Digital Format","Going Digital: Strategies for Access, Preservation, and Conversion of Collections to a Digital Format offers you succinct and analytic views of the problems and benefits of digital resources in the traditional academic library. Library administrators, collection managers, and librarians will learn the advantages and disadvantages of traditional and digital collections and the costs of providing local access or implementing remote access to digital collections. Originally presented at a series of five symposiums sponsored by the Research Libraries Group, the articles inGoing Digital will help you decide upon a cost-effective collection method that will meet the needs of your library, your patrons, and your budget. The chapters in this text are written by the nation’s leading librarians who pose and answer questions about hardware and software needed for digital libraries, the costs involved, establishing and maintaining access to digital collections, copyright concerns, and long-term preservation problems. Going Digital gives you insight into factors that will help you decide what will best meet the goals of your library, such as: the advantages and disadvantages of preserving microfilm and digital conversion choosing the correct hardware and software for your digital preservation program the changes required from librarians when shifting from collection development to digital resources examining the selection process for collections from perspectives of access, public service, technological requirements, and preservation ways to improve access to traditional collections cost comparisons between digital and hard copy resources devising a technical plan for successful digital conversion of projects involving the user’s wants when selecting collections for digital conversion and recognizing the central parts patrons play in the selection process In light of the changing ways we receive and keep our information, Going Digital discusses new collection preservation criteria and suggests that access and informational values, not just deterioration, should be equal factors in selecting materials to be converted to digital form. Proving that digital collections are changing every facet of library operations, Going Digital shows you the most cost-effective way to begin a digital collection and how to choose what materials to digitize in order to provide your patrons with the information they want and need. © 1995 Robert L.

D. Misra; G. R. Thoma; Is,2013,Use of Descriptive Metadata as a Knowledgebase for Analyzing Data in Large Textual Collections,"Descriptive metadata, such as an article's title, authors, institutional affiliations, keywords and date of publication, collected either manually or automatically from documents contents, is often used to search and retrieve relevant documents in an archived collection. This metadata, especially for a large text corpus such as a biomedical collection, may encapsulate patterns, trends, and other valuable information, usually revealed by using specialized data analysis software to answer specific questions. A more useful, generalized approach is to repurpose this metadata to serve as a knowledgebase to answer appropriate semantic queries.At the US National Library of Medicine (NLM), we recently archived a large biomedical collection comprising annual conference proceedings containing research findings on cholera, conducted between the years 1960-2011 under the US-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program"" (CMSP). This program was established to address health problems in Southeast Asia and other developing countries. An R&D information management system developed at NLM, called ""System for the Preservation of Electronic Resources"" (SPER), automatically extracted descriptive metadata from this text corpus and built a DSpace-based archive for accessing the conference articles. SPER also used this metadata to get detailed information regarding the CMSP research community, timelines of important drugs and discoveries and international collaboration, etc., using special purpose data analysis software.In this paper, we describe the occurrence and extraction of metadata from the CMSP document set, and present an alternative approach in which this metadata is used to build a knowledgebase to support semantic queries about the CMSP Program. Specifically, we show the OWL-based hierarchical ontology model created to represent the CMSP Program with its publications, participants and international collaboration over time. We discuss the technique used to convert the extracted metadata from relational database tables to OWL/RDF assertions suitable for supporting semantic queries. We show examples of queries performed against this CMSP knowledgebase, and discuss some scalability issues. Finally we describe how this approach could be customized for other large textual collections, including one from the Food and Drug Administration previously archived by the SPER system."""

In this article we explore the hypothesis that longevity is a non-functional quality attribute of information and software artifacts, driven by organizational capabilities and socio-technical change processes. While software evolution and maintenance have produced a rich body of knowledge on keeping software systems alive after creation, little emphasis has been placed on the underlying factors contributing to the longevity of information systems up-front.

D. Proença; J. Borbinha; N. Grindley,2013,The role of risk analysis to support cost models for digital preservation,"Cost can be viewed as the amount required to resource inputs into an activity, and there will usually be a need to evaluate these inputs against the outcomes or benefits. Cost modeling techniques exist in many areas, to help to calculate and anticipate the costs of a given activity. However, there are areas where there is still insufficient knowledge about potential costs, and this is relevant for the domain of digital preservation. Particularly in this area, costs can only be understood in relation to benefits, and the benefits of investing in digital preservation have to be assessed against the potential threats that organizations face. For example, an analysis of the risks of format obsolescence or of a failure of business continuity should motivate organizations to undertake digital preservation when it becomes evident that the potential loss of value of not doing so overcomes the cost. In order for cost models to be useful, it is critical that they are linked to an analysis of the risks in the given domain. Risk analysis should be the foundation of cost modeling so that all costs can be traced back to a specific set of threats that are applicable to the relevant domains and contexts. For some domains where extensive risk analysis has already been done and the benefits are well defined, this may be fairly straightforward. For other domains it might be more difficult. That is the case of digital preservation, where the costs and benefits are not currently widely and well understood but there is also anxiety about not engaging with digital preservation. Many organizations struggle to understand its value and the reason for this is that there is an insufficient focus on the role of risk in decision-making and preservation planning. The European Commission's FP7 funded 4C project aims to address a number of issues that relate directly to the cost determinants of digital preservation, one of the most important being an assessment of risk. The objective is to define a clearer economic landscape within which organizations can operate with confidence and where commercial and community-driven organizations can provide solutions that are reliable and effective, but also economic, timely and sustainable. Large memory and archiving institutions are dealing with an ever increasing amount of digital data and there is a concomitant need for scalable and effective solutions and services to emerge that enable them to tackle that challenge. Medium and smaller organizations, as also entities in the private sector, face different types of challenges and a diversity of solutions are required. The cost of digital preservation needs to be understood through a number of different lenses. Benefits, value and sustainability are three different perspectives that must influence cost but a fundamental understanding of risk - and risk in relation to organizational mission - is of crucial importance. This can bring a new view to digital preservation, making it possible to analyze scenarios and take decisions based on perceptions of objective added value, and not only as objective costs and subjective values. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."
D. R. Donaldson; E. Yakel,2013,Secondary adoption of technology standards: The case of PREMIS,"While archival scholars have identified some of the most important steps for deciding to use and implement metadata standards in archives, very little systematic empirical investigation within the archival science literature regards either how implementation processes actually unfold or the factors affecting implementation. This article analyzes the organizational factors and processes that come into play during implementation of metadata standards, using PREservation metadata: implementation strategies (PREMIS) as an exemplar. Adapting a theoretical framework for secondary adoption of technologies from Gallivan (Database Adv Inf Syst 32(3):51, 2001), the authors apply their model to the PREMIS technology standard and investigate PREMIS implementation by projects/programs on the Library of Congress PREMIS Implementation Registry.

While many user studies regarding digital collections have focused on their users and information behaviors, there is not much research on how digital archives have contributed to historical scholarship and why historians use them. Understanding which digital collections are useful for topical coverage in historical studies will provide important information in the development and assessment of digital preservation projects. This study examines the topical coverage of historical articles that cite digital archival collections, and also the content of digital archival collections that appear in these articles. By mapping the contents of the articles and digital archival collections, this study aims to understand historians' use context for their historical research and to relate the association of digital projects to the scholarship of history."

E. S. Gbaje; Z. Mohammed,2013,Digital preservation policy in National Information Centres in Nigeria,"Purpose - The study aims to examine availability, coverage of digital preservation policy and the structures put in place by National Information Centres in Nigeria to preserve digital information. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative research methodology using a case study approach was adopted. Documentary sources, a semi-structured questionnaire for the focus group, and interviews were the instruments used to collect data. While a homogeneous sampling of five staff in the digitisation/digital preservation unit was adopted for the focus group interview, only one top management staff member from the rank of Assistant Director of each of the selected three National Information Centres was interviewed. Findings - The National Bureau of Statistics and the National Library of Nigeria have digital preservation policies. However, the area of coverage of the available policies is not adequate enough to ensure the long-term preservation of digital information. Similarly, the study revealed that the lack of institutional support from the National Information Centres studied is one of the challenges in the implementation of the digital preservation policy. Practical implications - For any National Information Centre to ensure the accessibility and reuse of its digital information, it must have a digital preservation policy, without which the active management of digital information will be very challenging and can result in the loss of vital digital information of significant importance. Originality/value - There is currently no research work addressing issues on digital preservation policy with a particular focus on Nigeria. This paper therefore highlights shortcomings of the available digital preservation policy and proposes a national digital preservation policy that will chart a road map for effective digital preservation activities in any National Information Centre.

F. T. Marchese; Is,2013,Software Archaeology and the Preservation of Code-based Digital Art,"The long-term conservation of code-based digital art remains an open issue. Recently, we have proposed the use of software engineering methodologies to create rigorously structured documentation that will support archival preservation of a digital artwork with the intent of future installation. In this paper we expand this notion by proposing that the software engineering process, and its artifacts provide a means for systematically organizing and comparing a collection of digital artworks. In so doing, software engineering transforms existing artisanal preservation procedures into a schematized process that can be integrated with traditional art conservation practice. Software preservation also becomes an activity associated with software archaeology: the systematic study of software systems through the recovery and examination of outstanding material evidence, such as source code, tests, and design documentation. The paper focuses as well on the practice of software archaeology as it applies to the systematic study of software-based artworks to: reveal patterns in their underlying architectures, preserve archetypal software, maintain a historical record, and select artifacts for preservation."

G.-J. van Bussel; H. Henseler,2013,Digital Archiving and e-Discovery: Delivering Evidence in an age of Overload,"Within e-Government, trust in electronic stored information (ESI) is a necessity, not only when communicating with citizens, but also for organizational transparency and accountability. In the last decades, most organizations underwent substantial reorganization. The integration of structured data in relational databases has improved documentation of business transactions and increased data quality. That integration has improved accountability as well. Almost 90% of the information that organizations manage is unstructured (e. g., e-mail, documents, multimedia files, etc.). Those files cannot be integrated into a traditional database in an easy way. Like structured data, unstructured ESI in organizations can be denoted as records, when it is meant to be (and used as) evidence for organizational policies, decisions, products, actions and transactions. Stakeholders in e-Government, like citizens, governments and courts, are making increasing demands for the trustworthiness of this ESI for privacy, evidential and transparency reasons. A theoretical analysis of literature of information, organization and archival science illustrates that for delivering evidence, reconstruction of the past is essential, even in this age of information overload. We want to analyse how Digital Archiving and e-Discovery contribute to the realization of trusted ESI, to the reconstruction of the past and to delivering evidence. Digital Archiving ensures (by implementing and managing the 'information value chain') that: [1] ESI can be trusted, that it meets the necessary three dimensions of information: quality, context and relevance, and that [2] trusted ESI meets the remaining fourth dimension of information: survival, so that it is preserved for as long as is necessary (even indefinitely) to comply to privacy, accountability and transparency regulations. E-Discovery is any process (or series of processes) in which (trusted) ESI is sought, located, secured and searched with the intent of using it as evidence in a civil or criminal legal case. A difference between the two mechanisms is that Digital Archiving is implemented ex ante and e-Discovery ex post legal proceedings. The combination of both mechanisms ensures that organizations have a documented understanding of [1] the processing of policies, decisions, products, actions and transactions within (inter-) organizational processes; [2] the way organizations account for those policies, decisions, products, actions and transactions within their business processes; and [3] the reconstruction of policies, decisions, products, actions and transactions from business processes over time. This understanding is extremely important for the realization of e-Government, for which reconstruction of the past is an essential functionality. Both mechanisms are illustrated with references to practical examples."
H. C. Hsu,2013,Strategies and achievements of overseas taiwanese archives acquisition,"Archives, being original records of all human activities, provide first-hand sources for historical research. However, due to the geographic location of Taiwan and its political vicissitudes, many of these primary records and valuable resources of Taiwan history have been drained with human relocation to overseas and remained in foreign countries. In 2007, the ‘International Collaboration of Taiwan Historical Resources Acquisition Project’ was launched, aiming to collect and acquire precious historical materials scattered overseas with digital archiving strategies and value-added approaches. Taking into consideration the constraints of time and distance, the project focused first in acquiring historical resources of the Qing Dynasty and Japanese Era, while at the same time continued the ongoing practice of the Institute of Taiwan History in collecting and obtaining historical materials from the greater society. In the past five years, precious sources and data have been gathered through the international academic network. The achievements include acquisition of historical images of Taiwan, personal documents, official records etc. and authorization for online publication of historical materials.

I. Subotic; L. Rosenthaler; H. Schuldt,2013,A distributed archival network for process-oriented autonomic long-term digital preservation,"The reliable and consistent long-term preservation of digital content and metadata is becoming increasingly important - even though the storage media used are potentially subject to failures, or the data formats may become obsolete over time. A common approach is to replicate data across several sites to increase their availability. Nevertheless, network, software, or hardware failures as well as the evolution of data formats have to be coped with in a timely and, ideally, an autonomous way, without intervention of an administrator. In this paper we present DISTARNET, a distributed, autonomous long-term digital preservation system. Essentially, DISTARNET exploits dedicated processes to ensure the integrity and consistency of data with a given replication degree. At the data level, DISTARNET supports complex data objects, the management of collections, annotations, and arbitrary links between digital objects. At process level, dynamic replication management, consistency checking, and automated recovery of the archived digital objects is pro- vided utilizing autonomic behavior governed by preservation policies without any centralized component. We present the concepts and implementation of the distributed DISTAR- NET preservation approach. Most importantly, we provide details of the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the DISTARNET system. The former addresses the effectiveness of the internal preservation processes while the latter evaluates DISTARNET's performance regarding the overall archiving storage capacity and scalability.

Ruiz,2013,Digital preservation cost: A cost accounting approach,"Purpose: Digital preservation (DP) is the term used to describe the processes that guarantee the accessibility of data in the long term. The high value of health information justifies the use of electronic health records and the DP of them. This paper aims to examine one of the economic aspects of DP, presenting a cost model proposal for DP in health care organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Using a cost accounting methodology and beginning from the product and productive process definition, the authors propose a customized application of cost calculation to digital preservation for health data. Findings: This paper contributes to the existing literature with a cost model proposal to calculate the cost of DP applying a cost analysis methodology. Research limitations/implications: The authors present a cost model to the DP process in the health care field, with specific, concrete and limited kind of digital formats to be preserved. This can represent a limitation to this paper. Practical implications: Implementing a cost model of DP in hospital is a practical way to obtain basic information for making decisions regarding preservation. Originality/value: This paper sheds light on how to apply the methodology of one of the most traditional information systems, accounting, to one of the newest information systems, DP. © ."

J. F. Brunelle; M. L. Nelson; L. Balakireva; R. Sanderson; H. Van De Sompel,2013,Evaluating the SiteStory transactional web archive with the ApacheBench tool,"Conventional Web archives are created by periodically crawling a Web site and archiving the responses from the Web server. Although easy to implement and commonly deployed, this form of archiving typically misses updates and may not be suitable for all preservation scenarios, for example a site that is required (perhaps for records compliance) to keep a copy of all pages it has served. In contrast, transactional archives work in conjunction with a Web server to record all content that has been served. Los Alamos National Laboratory has developed SiteStory, an open-source transactional archive written in Java that runs on Apache Web servers, provides a Memento compatible access interface, and WARC file export features. We used Apache's ApacheBench utility on a pre-release version of SiteStory to measure response time and content delivery time in different environments. The performance tests were designed to determine the feasibility of SiteStory as a production-level solution for high fidelity automatic Web archiving. We found that SiteStory does not significantly affect content server performance when it is performing transactional archiving. Content server performance slows from 0.076 seconds to 0.086 seconds per Web page access when the content server is under load, and from 0.15 seconds to 0.21 seconds when the resource has many embedded and changing resources. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."
J. Foster; S. Benford; D. Price,2013,Digital archiving as information production: Using experts and learners in the design of subject access,"Purpose: This article aims to develop a framework that considers digital archiving as a form of networked information production, in which the different stages of producing a digital archive are modularized and distributed across different actors. The framework is applied and developed within the context of designing a digital archive for the electronic artwork Rider Spoke. More specifically the framework is applied and developed within the context of designing a subject scheme that provides its users with consistent yet relevant access to the content of the archive. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 74 postgraduate students from the Information School at the University of Sheffield were invited to tag four videos from the Riders Have Spoken archive as a voluntary exercise. Students were evenly distributed across the four videos and each participant was invited to generate up to ten tags; with each tag or annotation representing a point of interest in the content of the video for viewer. The time was also noted. In total, 46 students completed the exercise and this generated 356 user tags. As a collection these tags and annotations represent the terms and vocabulary on which a subsequent content analysis was conducted and a subject language developed. Findings: The development of a subject scheme for a particular single electronic artwork with seven facets, sub-facets, and illustrative examples is presented. The design of the scheme and its relations to prior work in classification is discussed. Research limitations/implications: Implications of the research for the design of a digital archive and the methods used to construct them are discussed Originality/value: The originality of the article lies in its characterization of digital archiving as a form of networked information production; and the application of the framework to the design of a faceted scheme enabling subject access to the digital archive of an electronic artwork called Rider Spoke. © ."
J. Jiang; J.

Visual editing and retouching are usually made by experts in museums to match the reproduction with the original more closely. While effective, visual editing and retouching is time-consuming and labor-intensive. We addressed this problem by learning from the adjustments made by observers, and automatically making visual editing and retouching on incoming paintings. The evaluation results suggest that the image adjusted by our model is significantly better than the average of the images adjusted by observers."
J. K. Chiang; E. Yen,2013,Gestalt of a long-term archive management system on semantic grid,"Long-term preservation (LTP) is an appealing new research area. Its goal is to make the sustainability of archives lasting for a foreseeable enough time. The efforts are primarily hampered by challenges such as missing of stands, formal methodology and workflow management during archiving process. Further deficits are failing to keep interoperation among archives, information loss without any sense of information decay etc. Objective of this research is to develop the LTP of various kinds of documents, independent from the evolution of time and changes in techniques and digital environments. Basic requirements come from integration of storage management and information management, securing preservation of data, metadata, indexes, etc. This paper illustrates the evolutionary development of the LTP for Governmental Archive Management and Knowledge Management with respect to aforementioned requirements. Effective search to resources and efficient storage/access on data, consistent user-interface, recovery drawing on co-location back-up, dynamic regulation on authentication and security management are tasks followed. Then, a pilot Semantic Data Grid and its annotation and service matching mechanisms are described, where the ontologism play a crucial role. Last but not least, experiences learned and the future works with respect to the semantic grid for LTP will be summarized. © 2013 IEEE."
J. Ma; H. Abie; T. Skramstad; M. Nygård,2013,Development and validation of requirements for evidential value for assessing trustworthiness of digital records over time,"The issue of trust in the management of digital records has been a topic of research for a number of years. During this time most researchers have concentrated on the nature and meaning of the record itself, rather than the potential use of the record as evidence of the originators' origins, functions, and activities. Through a comparison of trust in the real world and trust in the digital world, we demonstrate the importance of evidential value for the objective assessment of the trustworthiness of digital records. In this paper we investigate, identify, and specify the requirements for evidential value, based on our record's life-cycle model. We validate these requirements by using an online questionnaire survey. Finally, we show briefly how these requirements can be used in the assessment of the trustworthiness of records over time. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) it provides a record's life-cycle model which is suitable for the assessment of the trustworthiness of digital records; 2) it proposes and validates the requirements for evidential value for assessing the trustworthiness of digital records."

Once an almost proprietary term for museums and library science programs, the term digital curation"" has recently become a buzzword within more generalist communities. Recently, digital curation has become an umbrella concept to describe activities related to digital preservation, data curation, electronic records management, copyright management, digital asset management, data collection, reporting and presentation activities, and even content remixing activities. Yakel (2007) observed four discrete treatments of digital curation in government reports and called for increased attention to the development of the term's meaning as diverse communities become involved in the dialogue. This article explores the different usages of the term, those usage's relationships to the attention economy for different groups (for example, journalists use the term to emphasize the attracting near-term attention to ephemeral digital artifacts while librarians emphasize the long-term storage and preservation of digital artifacts), and confusion created by the different agendas of its use. This article explores relevant literature from multiple disciplines and analyzes contemporary media industry sources to consider the differences implied by the term's use, including the differences in political economy, community goals, perceptions of content life cycles, the utilization of short-tail and long-tail access strategies and even expressed data values. © Common Ground, J.

There was consensus that using the existing Broadcast wave file format with metadata embedded into the axml chunk would be a starting point. The ResCarta Foundation has released a version of the ResCarta Toolkit which can create Broadcast wave files with embedded METS formatted metadata in the axml chunk and uses marker chunks to provide full transcription with time offsets. This file format will allow a single digital file to carry the associated technical, administrative and descriptive metadata and allows for full text search within transcriptions. The use of such a file format in oral history projects will allow for finer granularity in the use of archived digital audio files. The ResCarta software is utilized around the world for textual and pictorial digital objects. With the addition of audio reformatting, it can create raw transcriptions of audio files and has a full, built-in audio transcription editor.

Information Literacy and Cultural Heritage explores this landscape and covers perspectives from museums, archives and libraries, highlighting the role of memory and contested history in the collection, description and presentation of cultural heritage. The book argues that the convergence of libraries, archives and museums in digital preservation should be extended to include the development of combined lifelong learning programmes, teaching both information literacy skills and awareness of cultural heritage. This title is structured into seven chapters, covering cultural heritage in the library, archive and museum context; digital information contexts; an overview of information literacy models of stages and processes, as well as models of standards, competencies and performance indicators. The book then examines the role of critical thinking and lifelong learning; proposes a generic model of information literacy and cultural heritage for lifelong learning; offers guidelines for adapting the model to local contexts; and offers a conclusion. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved."
K. Herrera,2013,"Go, lovely rose: On the ephemeral nature of interactive e-books","Spurred on by the rapid pace of technological development, a new breed of highly interactive e-books has arisen. Ironically, the same rapid pace of development makes preserving these e-books a near-impossible task for libraries. Although libraries have extensive experience with print preservation, many hardware and software variables combine to make preservation of e-books a much different undertaking. Even technically oriented preservation projects with images, audio, video, and born-digital content do not translate into the experience needed to preserve interactive ebooks. In considering libraries' preservation experiences, there is a decided gap in expertise that leaves these digital objects vulnerable to obsolescence. The level of commitment and resources required to effectively preserve interactive ebooks over the long term is impractical for most libraries. Instead, a new level of engagement with content providers coupled with more encompassing adoption of emerging e-book standards offers perhaps the best opportunity for preservation. These items offer unique user interfaces, artwork, and other elements that make them worth saving. They have value now as digital objects in their own right, and they will offer future researchers insight into the evolution of ebooks-if they can be preserved. © Common Ground, Kevin Herrera, All Rights Reserved."

The collection had suffered significant damage over the course of its history, most notably from two fires and unsuitable historical restoration treatments. This article discusses a project undertaken at the British Library to develop a strategy for the long-term preservation of the burnt Cotton Collection whilst increasing accessibility to the collection, and to provide a knowledge base for use when considering conservation of other similarly-damaged parchment manuscripts.The initial stage of the project involved a condition survey of the burnt volumes of the Cotton Collection, identifying those items which needed to be withdrawn from immediate use in the library due to their fragility. The results of the survey were used to help design a long-term plan for the preservation of this collection. Research to determine the best methods of stabilizing and housing the items, and ameliorating the effects of past treatments were also undertaken. One particular outcome of the project was to prioritize the digitization of these manuscripts, to enable intellectual access to a physically very fragile collection. © 2013 Icon, The Institute of Conservation."
M. Chaumont; L. Tribouillard; G. Subsol; F. Courtade; J. Pasquet; M. Derras,2013,Automatic localization of tombs in aerial imagery: Application to the digital archiving of cemetery heritage,"This paper deals with digital archiving of cemetery heritage. A built cemetery is a tangible evidence of historical and cultural periods through the style and the shape of tombs. It gives quantitative information on the local population, about its history (by reading birth and death dates), its culture (by analysing name typology) and its temporal evolution (by using the family names written on the tombs). There is thus a crucial need to archive cemetery data for heritage purposes. The first step for digital archiving is to locate the tombs. A practical way is to use aerial images. We propose to automate this process by using image processing algorithms. This is a challenging problem, as in aerial images, tombs have very variable appearance, size and disposition, and many artefacts can occur such as occluding vegetation, shadows or walking people. We focused our study specifically on French cemeteries in Haute-Marne department, all located in villages close to the Langres city. We compare three automated localization methods. All the preliminary results are commented and we discuss other image-processing applications which could be used to enrich cemetery archiving such as writing recognition on headstones. © 2013 IEEE."

Design/methodology/approach: By means of a thorough review of the literature in this area and an analysis of the current state of the art, the paper investigates a three-level digital preservation framework with a focus on the public sector. It cross-links this framework with the cloud computing concept, in order to propose an appropriate solution. Findings: The mapping of six factors of digital preservation to three levels of digital preservation shows that using appropriate steps supported by suitable strategies and policies enables the public administration sector to take advantage of modern information technology and solve the demanding and critical problem of digital preservation. Practical implications: The paper suggests an organisational and technological solution in the form of a centralised digital preservation repository within a cloud computing framework, to aid both organisations of the public sector which deal with active life cycle document phases and archives and libraries which deal with passive phases of documents and records. Originality/value: The paper addresses the difficulties of digital preservation implementation in the public administration sector. The findings indicate that while developing and implementing digital preservation, the public administration sector should formulate common policies and solutions based on the suggested results of this paper and, in doing so, maximise the benefits of current technologies. © ."

To archive these works in an HPC storage resource where they will be actively managed and preserved, the DVDs have to be converted into files that can fulfill both preservation and access functions. A survey of the technical lineage of the pieces as well as best practices in digital and in video preservation were important to decide the configuration of an automated workflow and the components of a SIP to submit the video files to storage. Quality video metrics were used to achieve a losseless conversion of the DVDs and were included in the workflow to verify the integrity of the conversions. Metadata about the files is gathered to dynamically customize the conversion processes according to the characteristics of the input DVD.

M. Gede; J. Meszaros,2013,Digital Archiving and On-line Publishing of Old Relief Models,"Although people rarely think of relief models when speaking about cartographic products, these artefacts are probably the most impressive way of visualizing landscapes. Unlike traditional maps or globes, most relief models are unique, vulnerable hand-made objects. Digital archiving is an important step in their preservation. There are special tools for this task, but these equipments are rather expensive, and libraries or other institutes that usually own these models cannot spend too much. The authors examined various on-line tools to create digital 3D representation of relief models using a set of photographs as source. These tools create point cloud and textured triangle mesh based on matching patterns on the photos. A workflow was developed which uses these web services and produces the digital 3D version of relief models. This paper introduces the method, discusses the details of successful photographing, the possible post-processing of the results. A new web site, using the X3DOM technology to show the digitized models to the general public, is also introduced."
M. Guercio; S. Salza,2013,Managing authenticity through the digital resource lifecycle,"On the basis of principles and methodologies developed by the major projects on digital preservation, the paper addresses the fundamental problem of authenticity management, and specifically of defining appropriate mechanisms and tools to transform the presumption of authenticity into the capacity of its verification. The approach we propose is to concentrate on the digital resource lifecycle, since, in order to make a proper assessment, one must be able to trace back all the transformations the digital resource has undergone since its creation, and that may have affected its authenticity. For these transformations one needs to collect and preserve the appropriate evidence that would allow, at a later time, to make the assessment. We have therefore developed a model of the digital resource lifecycle in order to identify the main events that impact on authenticity and to define precise operational guidelines to specify which evidence should be collected and how to organize it. A case study analysis is currently being performed to check the validity of the model and to see how it specializes on several specific environments. Preliminary results are already available and confirm that the model is sound and that the implementation of the guidelines can be worked out effectively and with a fairly reasonable amount of effort. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."
M. James Shyu; M. C. Lee,2013,NON-CONTACT COLOR ANALYSIS AND DIGITAL ARCHIVE METHOD FOR BLUE-AND-WHITE PORCELAIN BY USING SPECTRAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY,"The unique colour representation of Oriental art work distinguishes itself from what has been seen in Western art work. Not only the traditional Oriental watercolour paintings but also the ancient Chinese porcelains show a great deal of interesting colours that have been archived by digital camera in digital archive practice. However, the majority of the current digital cameras operate with RGB filters, which record every pixel in a tri-chromatic manner. There are several limitations for such a tri-chromatic camera. One is that it describes the colour of the object only by three primary colours. Another is that the image captured is strongly influenced by the illumination at the scene, such that the archived image appears as it does specifically under that lighting condition, not as the original object itself. With such limitations, a problem called ‘metamerism’ may occur when an object is viewed under different illuminations. This creates a serious problem when colour is a critical factor in the digital archiving process. Spectral imaging technology is capable of capturing the colour in spectral form, and the spectral reflectance of each pixel is recorded accordingly. With consequent analysis and process, art works can be archived with high precision spectral data with the advantages of resolving the issue of metamerism and of reproducing the art work under any kind of illumination. Another advantage of spectral imaging technology is that it captures and analyzes the spectral data of an art work without any physical contact. In this study ancient Chinese blue-and-white porcelains collected by the Hwa-Kang Museum of the Chinese Culture University are digitised by spectral imaging technology. A custom-built spectral camera is used to capture the spectral image by using a new spectrograph device. Statistics analysis is used to extract the primary spectral reflectance from the captured spectral data. Comparisons can then be made to explore the differences among the colour primaries of the porcelains. This new spectral system and the colour analysis of blue-and-white porcelain as well as the resulting spectral characteristics of this porcelain can be a new benchmark for the museum community in digital archiving. © Edinburgh University Press and the Association for History and Computing 2013."
M. Kalentsits; A. Gribling,2013,What goes up must come down: Publications from developing countries in the Aquatic Commons,"During 2010-2012, the Fisheries and Aquaculture Branch Library (FBL) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was involved in a project that included the selection, digitizing, web-optimization, creation of metadata, and uploading into the Aquatic Commons (AC) digital repository of grey literature published by, amongst others, issuing agencies in several African countries, and a regional project in Asia - the STREAM Initiative. Furthermore, links to these full text online versions have been added to the Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts (ASFA) bibliographic database. The AC is a thematic digital repository covering the marine, estuarine, brackish and freshwater environments. This repository is directed by the International Association of Aquatic and Marine Science Libraries and Information Centers (IAMSLIC) and hosted by the UNESCO/IOC International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) project office in Belgium. The AC repository is built on Eprints software. In addition, it uses the related Interoperable Repository Statistics (IRS) software for usage statistics. The paper presents the results of the analysis of the access to the grey literature from selected issuing agencies in developing countries, whereby it focuses specifically on the Technical Documents, published by the Lake Victoria Fisheries Research Project and those published by the Support to Regional Aquatic Resources Management (STREAM), which was based in Bangkok, Thailand. Examples of digital preservation and repatriation to countries of origin, two of the main objectives for FAO's participation in the repository, are discussed. By using the IRS software the paper seeks to evaluate FAO's contribution to the content development of the repository and it finds a confirmation of the increasing visibility of and access to some baseline information in the field of fisheries and aquaculture published by institutions and/or projects in developing countries. Finally, the paper describes some of the utilities and limitations of the software."
M. Kelly; J. F. Brunelle; M. C. Weigle; M. L. Nelson,2013,On the change in archivability of websites over time,"As web technologies evolve, web archivists work to keep up so that our digital history is preserved. Recent advances in web technologies have introduced client-side executed scripts that load data without a referential identifier or that require user interaction (e.g., content loading when the page has scrolled). These advances have made automating methods for capturing web pages more difficult. Because of the evolving schemes of publishing web pages along with the progressive capability of web preservation tools, the archivability of pages on the web has varied over time. In this paper we show that the archivability of a web page can be deduced from the type of page being archived, which aligns with that page's accessibility in respect to dynamic content. We show concrete examples of when these technologies were introduced by referencing mementos of pages that have persisted through a long evolution of available technologies. Identifying these reasons for the inability of these web pages to be archived in the past in respect to accessibility serves as a guide for ensuring that content that has longevity is published using good practice methods that make it available for preservation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."

M. M. Madrid,2013,A study of digital curator competences: Asurvey of experts,"The aim of this research was to define competences for digital curators, and to validate a Delphi process in the context of Library, Archives, Museum curriculum development. The objective for the study was to obtain consensus regarding competence statements for Library, Archives and Museum digital curators. The Delphi method, a research technique, typically used to develop a consensus of opinion for topic areas in which there is little previously documented knowledge, was used in specifying the digital curator competences in LAM context. Three rounds of questionnaires with controlled feedback with space for comments and/or suggestions were sent to panel members. Five point Likert scale was employed in the questionnaire. Consensus was determined when a competence statement received a mode higher than 3, an average mean more than 3.5, and a standard deviation smaller than 1.0.Response rates for rounds I, II and III were: 70% (n=16), 87.5% (n=14), and 94% (n=15) respectively. Of the 18 digital curator competences listed in the first round questionnaire, 13 (70%) achieved consensus as being necessary digital curator competences required of advanced level digital curator. Other inputs of respondents like comments and suggestions were also analyzed. An additional 23 digital curator competence statements were also suggested by the panel in round I and further developed in subsequent rounds. In round II, 12 (30%) competence statements achieved consensus. The final round and editing of competence statements led to 20 statements that describe what a well-prepared digital curator trained to participate in digital curation work should be able to do. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."
M. Phillips; J. Bailey; A. Goethals; T. Owens,2013,The NDSA levels of digital preservation: Explanation and uses,"The Levels of Digital Preservation"" being refined now by the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA), is a tiered set of recommendations on how organizations should begin to build or enhance their digital preservation activities. A work in progress, it is intended to be a relatively easy-to-use set of guidelines useful not only for those just beginning to think about preserving their digital assets, but also for institutions planning the next steps in enhancing their existing digital preservation systems and workflows. It allows institutions to assess the level of preservation achieved for specific materials in their custody. It is not designed to assess the robustness of digital preservation programs as a whole since it does not cover such things as policies, staffing, or organizational support. The guidelines are organized into five functional areas that are at the heart of digital preservation systems: storage and geographic location, file fixity and data integrity, information security, metadata, and file formats. This paper presents the Levels, explains the context of the project's development within the NDSA, describes the rationale behind each of the guidelines and why they were prioritized the way they were, suggests how the guidelines may be used, and compares and contrasts the Levels to other ways of assessing stages of digital preservation. Other assessment models include Nancy McGovern and Anne Kenney's ""The Five Organizational Stages of Digital Preservation,"" Charles Dollar and Lori Ashley's ""Digital Preservation Capability Maturity Model,"" and OCLC Research's 2012 report, ""You've Got to Walk Before You Can Run: First Steps for Managing Born-Digital Content Received on Physical Media.""

Their objective was to document the changes coincident with the shift in leadership of the U.S. executive branch. The five partners identified key resources from the U.S. .gov Top Level Domain and completed crawls from September 2008 until March 2009. The resulting End of Term (EOT) 2008 Web Archive, a 16 TB dataset, was distributed to partners interested in providing local services and access to the archive. The UNT Libraries investigated Portable Document Format (PDF) files, a class of content many information professionals associate with the traditional notion of discrete documents"". Over four million unique PDF documents were extracted from the Archive and a series of metadata and information extraction processes were conducted for each document. Additionally, derivative raster images of the first page of each document were created. These metrics were ingested into a database for further analysis, which brought to light previously hidden characteristics of the federal government's Web-published content. The paper discusses the overall workflow and describes the tools used to extract document features. Findings suggest opportunities for the development of retrieval tools that will provide new ways of selecting content and building collections from large Web archives."""
M. Ras,2013,The international e-Depot to guarantee permanent access to scholarly publications,"As scholars have become increasingly reliant upon the electronic versions of scholarly journals, long term preservation of these resources has become of major importance and a growing need for the library community. The Koninklijke Bibliotheek, the National Library of The Netherlands, was one of the very first cultural heritage institutions to become aware of the emerging importance of digital resources. With the establishment of the e-Depot the KB has created in 2002 the first solution to provide permanent access to scholarly information. This goes beyond the national depository role of the KB as it also preserves publications from international, academic publishers that do not have a clear country of origin. The next step for the KB is to position the international e-Depot as a European service, which guarantees permanent access to international, academic publications on a European level. There is a danger that e-journals become ephemeral"" unless we take active steps to preserve the bits and bytes that increasingly represent our collective knowledge. Besides the threat of technical obsolescence there is the changing role of libraries. In the past libraries have assumed preservation responsibility for materials they collect, while publishers have supplied the materials libraries need. These well understood divisions of labour do not work in a digital environment and especially so when dealing with e-journals. So we need new models and organizations to ensure safe custody of these digital objects for future generations. The KB has invested in order to take its place within the research infrastructure at European level and the international e-Depot serves as a trustworthy digital archive for scholarly information for the European research community. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."""
M. S. Mills,2013,Facilitating multimodal literacy instruction through digital curation,"It is becoming clearer that multimodal literacies (specifically textual, visual, and digital) will frame classroom instruction for the near future. The mission of this chapter is to highlight the potential of digital curation as a means for facilitating multimodal literacy instruction and the subsequent creation of dynamic digital learning resources by both students and teachers. Over the past several decades, there has been a tremendous shift in how educators and students communicate, learn, and share ideas. As society moves more toward creating and sharing information through the aggregation, filtering, and customization of digital content, it is imperative that educators create opportunities for students to do likewise. Drawing on recent research on the cognitive benefits of multimodal literacy instruction and its potential for increasing opportunities for student engagement, this chapter will provide a rationale for, and subsequently sketch, a practical approach for teaching collaborative digital curation using Web 2.0 resources. © 2013, IGI Global."

Because RDF is comparatively new, the library and information science literature has scarcely addressed the issues. The article analyses RDF from the perspective of the requirements for long term digital archiving, with special emphasis on the need for maintaining integrity and usability. RDF and RDFa (resource description framework in attributes) encoding can be archived, but the external references that make RDF function may change their meaning or vanish over time, unless efforts are made to archive them too and to provide timebased context information through mechanisms like Memento. RDFbased “triple store” databases can likewise be archived. The value of this article lies in its examination of how RDF and its variants will work within the constraints of current long term digital archiving systems. RDF is relatively new, but its proponents see it as a long term enhancement of the web and of internetconnected projects. This requires some consideration about how it will function in 100 years or more. © 2013, "

M. van der Burgh; Is,2013,Metamorfoze in transition for prioritizing digitization archives,"Since 1997, Metamorfoze has developed into a mature subsidy program which is financed on a structural basis by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. It is still the programme that safeguards the preservation of important paper collections that suffer from accelerated self-destruction. The main threats to the Dutch paper heritage are identified as acidification in wood pulp papers, and ink corrosion.Metamorfoze has been based on selection and prioritization. Existing inventories and prioritization models have remained in effect until 2009. In addition to this, a selection model for archives was developed in 2005.The new track Archives and Special Collections focuses on archival materials and special collections. Within this track the emphasis lies on the conservation of the original sources, which calls for extremely high quality digital scans (Metamorfoze Preservation Imaging Guidelines).The projects in the Archives and Special Collections are now funded 70%, with the idea that institutions have a responsibility for the preservation of their collections.In the near future, more and more of the available resources of Metamorfoze will be applied for the permanent storage of the master scans, consequently and there will be less money available for the preservation and digitization of the Archives and Special Collections. This raises the question whether the truly most important archives of the Netherlands have yet been preserved and digitized. The desire is therefore that from 2013 onwards, the ABC program will be rearranged according to a thematic classification, to be imposed by an Advisory Committee, so that instead of a more or less demand-driven approach there will be a more structured approach.Partly because of the ensemble value or multidisciplinary nature, the projects within this approach should be fully (100%) subsidized"

Development of new data analysis methods becomes a significant, inseparable part of research. Digital preservation, reuse and reproducibility of computer experiment results become inherent attributes of scientific discovery. The paper investigates metadata structure to be attached to the processes specifying or implementing scientific data analysis methods for their reuse and result reproducibility. Process components and data are referred to the domain concepts and need to be supplied with the information about data provenance and quality. Specific test collections are needed to describe kinds of cases in which methods must behave in an anticipated way. Using the open myExperiment environment organizing and providing access to the collection of scientific workflows as an illustration, we demonstrate how the extension of its metadata could have allowed to organize the semantic search for methods relevant to a problem, to verify interoperability, reusability and reproducibility of processes implementing the methods."

Birney,2013,"Towards practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance information storage in synthesized DNA","Digital production, transmission and storage have revolutionized how we access and use information but have also made archiving an increasingly complex task that requires active, continuing maintenance of digital media. This challenge has focused some interest on DNA as an attractive target for information storage because of its capacity for high-density information encoding, longevity under easily achieved conditions and proven track record as an information bearer. Previous DNA-based information storage approaches have encoded only trivial amounts of information or were not amenable to scaling-up, and used no robust error-correction and lacked examination of their cost-efficiency for large-scale information archival. Here we describe a scalable method that can reliably store more information than has been handled before. We encoded computer files totalling 739 kilobytes of hard-disk storage and with an estimated Shannon information of 5.2 × 10 6 bits into a DNA code, synthesized this DNA, sequenced it and reconstructed the original files with 100% accuracy. Theoretical analysis indicates that our DNA-based storage scheme could be scaled far beyond current global information volumes and offers a realistic technology for large-scale, long-term and infrequently accessed digital archiving. In fact, current trends in technological advances are reducing DNA synthesis costs at a pace that should make our scheme cost-effective for sub-50-year archiving within a decade. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

N. Hussin; R. Johare,2013,Conceptual framework of functional requirements for the management of electronic court records in the superior court of Malaysia,"Technological change has always been a challenge to archivists, record practitioners, and IT personnel. The management of physical records fails to be regulated in the electronic environment as information systems fail to capture the necessary information needed and to function for long-term preservation. In the legal environment, the scope of legislation is referred to as its jurisdiction and, if not clear, can create difficulties for record managers and archivists to manage the court records. Regrettably, there are minimal policies or procedures on managing electronic court records in the Superior Court of Malaysia. Therefore, this case has developed the generic functional requirements for evaluating the existing record management systems in one of the courts in the Superior Court of Malaysia and for identifying the missing functional components for purposes of planning, upgrading, or acquiring new systems. © 2014 by IGI Global.

N. Krabbenhoeft; K. Skinner; M. Schultz; F. Zarndt,2013,Chronicles in preservation: Preserving digital news and newspapers,"Since the mid-1990s, libraries and archives have been digitizing newspapers for preservation and access. The standards used for this work have evolved significantly. Today's collections employ digitization, metadata extraction and standards, and file formats that are different from those used for early collections. Increasingly, libraries and archives also include borndigital material. Given the importance of newspapers as primary documents of history, libraries and archives must preserve their digitized and born-digital collections carefully. The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)1 has funded the Chronicles in Preservation project to study the preservation readiness of digital newspaper collections. Led by the Educopia Institute (www.educopia.org), the project has brought together seven academic libraries in the U.S. and three distributed digital preservation (DDP) systems-MetaArchive, Chronopolis, and the University of North Texas's Coda repository. These partners are accomplishing a range of activities. First, they investigated community standards, specifications, and practices for digital newspaper collections and distilled this information into a set of Guidelines for Digital Newspaper Preservation Readiness. Second, they exported collections from libraries and ingested them into the DDP systems, documenting these test exchanges in a Comparative Anaysis of Distributed Digital Frameworks. Finally, the project is augmenting a set of existing digital preservation tools to simplify the packaging and exchange of digital newspaper collections. This paper provides a walkthrough of the structure and contents of the Guidelines for Preservation Readiness of Digital Newspapers, shares the evaluative metrics for the Comparative Analysis of Distributed Digital Preservation Frameworks, and discusses the implementations of the interoperability tools."

Literature study showed more than 300 songket motives had been produced since the beginning and was stored digitally as preservation effort. Preliminary studies on 10 websites that promote and trade songket in Malaysia reveal that preservation of the motive was not a priority since they only stress on the selling of the product. The website only provides a keyword search for the customer to find songket based on their finished motives. Biggest drawback is the user didn't aware of the abundance of motive; hence making the search less effective. Previous study also shows there is no website that provide repository of songket motives information as a long term preservation effort. This research will focus on information gathering and imaging access of songket motives through sketching technique.

Three stories reveal progress towards success in that task. The context of these stories is the shift from print to digital format for all types of continuing resources, particularly journals, and the need to archive not just serials but also ongoing 'integrating resources' such as databases and Web sites.The first story is about The Keepers Registry, an international initiative to monitor the extent of e-journal archiving. The second story is about the variety of 'serial issues' that have had to be addressed during the PEPRS (Piloting an E-journals Preservation Registry Service) project which was commissioned in the UK by JISC. These include identification, naming and identification of publishers, and the continuing need for a universal holdings statement. The role of the ISSN, and of the ISSN-L, has been a key.The third story looks beyond e-journals to new research objects and the dynamics of the Web, to the role of citation and fixity, and to broader matters of digital preservation. This story reflects upon seriality, as the Web becomes the principal arena and medium for scholarly discourse. Scientific discourse is now resident on the Web. Much that is issued on the Web is issued nowhere else: it is a digital native.Statistics that indicate the extent of archiving for e-journals to which major university libraries subscribe are also included in the article. © 2013 ."

P. Svard,2013,Enterprise Content Management and the Records Continuum Model as strategies for long-term preservation of digital information,"The purpose of the paper is to establish whether Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and Records Continuum Model (RCM) frameworks could be used to mitigate long-term preservation challenges. Qualitative research was undertaken using two case studies and interviews were conducted with the different categories of the municipal personnel to solicit answers to the research questions. The questions were designed using the lens of the RCM and its four dimensions that cover the creation, capture, organization and pluralization of records and prescribed factors of ECM which include business process management, enterprise architecture, collaboration, system integration, re-purposing of information, change management, knowledge management and the life cycle management of information. Not all the ECM factors are dealt with in this paper: the remainder have been dealt with in the author's earlier works. Challenges of long-term preservation of information still persist despite the enormous research that has been generated over the years. The municipalities that were subjects of this research are still grappling with issues of lack of long-term information management policies, enterprise architecture, disparate information systems, collaboration and system integration. This is likely to work against the investments that are being ploughed into e-Government developments should the municipalities fail to espouse strong information and records management regimes. Embracing the ECM prescribed factors and the RCM thinking might mitigate these challenges. The author's licentiate research proved that there was no discourse between records managers/archivists and ECM proponents. Therefore, the originality of this article lies in the application of the two frameworks of ECM and RCM. The findings confirmed that even within the records management framework the municipalities were addressing factors similar to ECM prescribed factors. Embracing both the RCM model and the ECM prescribed factors might mitigate the challenges of long-term preservation and hence the re-use of information and enhancement of the societal memory. © 2013, "
Q. Bamo; C. Guo; H. Yin; G. Li,2013,Customizing discipline-based metadata standards for digital preservation of living epic traditions in China: Basic principles and challenges,"Epics in China are large in scale with multiple types. Creation epics, origination epics, and heroic epics have been orally transmitted or circulated among many ethnic groups. As a leading academic institution in the field of epic studies, the Institute of Ethnic Literature (IEL), Chines Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) has been committed to collecting, preserving, and exploring Chinese ethnic epic traditions for more than three decades so far. Since 2011, IEL has launched a key project entitled 'IEL Archives for Ethnic Minorities' Oral Traditions in China' at CASS level to construct a digital database to document and manage oral tradition materials, including epic tradition materials collected by research fellows from IEL during these years. The Epic Collection at IEL's Documentation Center for Ethnic Literature in China encompasses 43 ethnic minorities' epics handed down in the mainland China, especially the Three Grand Epics, namely Tibetan-Mongolian epic King Gesar/Geser, Mongolian epic Jangar, and Kirgiz epic Manas, which are still performed by the epic singers and storytellers from the different ethnic groups in the remote areas. Its main repositories possess audio-visual recordings, photographs, and varied manuscripts or texts with regard to different thematic data or data sets on epic traditional skills, expressive forms, social practices, ritual events, as well as life histories of epic performers and folk artists. The goal of the digital database, as established by IEL's plan, to serve for both academic studies and public promotion, along with the increasing need to share data, has made it essential to customize discipline-based metadata standards and facilitate the integration of different database. In the present paper, we introduce the process of customizing discipline-based metadata standards devoted to the documentation of living epic traditions in China, discussing the challenges we have encountered and our solutions, as well as some considerations of descriptive metadata for intangible cultural heritage. © 2013 IEEE."
Q. L. Nguyen; Is,2013,Towards a Large Access-Oriented Digital Archive,"The ultimate goal of preserving digital records is to make them accessible to the public and authorized parties for centuries. Such access should be done in a way that is independent of technical application softwares and platforms with which those records were created According to the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model, Access to records is one of the main components of an archival system. The Access component allows the Consumer to search for records in the Archival Storage, and obtain relevant result sets. Although Access is at the end of OAIS data flow, the quality of service that it can provide to the consumers depends on both ingest and preservation planning. Indeed the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process at ingest time will determine the richness and comprehensiveness of the created metadata, and the level of granularity or coarseness of the discovery and access process. Moreover, the planning and execution of preservation methods should take into account not only the pure transformation of file formats, but the quality of access and discovery of digital records. This paper examines the challenges to prepare and provide search and access to a large digital archives throughout the different phases of the OAIS functional flow, namely, ingest, and preservation. From the architecture perspective, the guiding principle of a large Access-Oriented Digital Archive should be to realize an Open Platform that facilitates the flow of data from ingest to access. The framework used to architect this platform layer should be extensible so that future search and access techniques could be easily inserted without major redesign of the system."

R. Barbau; J. Lubell; S. Rachuri; S. Foufou,2013,Toward a reference architecture for archival systems,"Long-term preservation of product data is imperative for many organizations. A product data archive should be designed to ensure information accessibility and understanding over time. Approaches such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model and the Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories (ACTDR) provide a framework for conceptually describing and evaluating archives. These approaches are generic and do not focus on particular contexts or content types. Enterprise architecture provides a way to describe systems in their potentially complex environments. This paper proposes a holistic approach to formally describe the architecture and the environment of archival systems. This approach relies on the formal representation of the preservation terminology, including OAIS concepts, using the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF). The approach covers the various interactions of other business functions with the archive, and the information models necessary to ensure preservation and accessibility. This approach is a step toward a reference architecture for the formal description of archival systems. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013."
R. Butler; M. Newnham; G. Moss; I. Gilmour; D. Dawson; Is,2013,Cross Media Preservation Planning,"Audio-visual media have recorded the 20th century in way no other era has been recorded. Film, audio and video have enabled significant people and events to be witnessed by millions of people. The problem of preserving this amount of information in the original analogue formats has been monumental and despite the best efforts only a fraction of the original recordings made survive worldwide. The skills required to adequately preserve and make accessible the remaining records have been honed for only the past two decades. And now the world has moved into the digital realm.This has engendered a new set of problems and demanded audio-visual archivists acquire a new set of skills while still requiring the original skills to manage the legacy collections. The costs required to digitise a legacy collection are largely beyond reach of all but the best resourced archive, and yet this is required if a collection is to be preserved and accessible. Consequently hard financial decisions about the way a collection is to be managed into the future need to be made by those responsible. Risk management is a crucial part of the decision making process.Digital collection preservation requires more than the creation of digital surrogates. It is a continuum starting with ensuring the original file is intact, the development of strategies for managing the changing environment of files types and hardware evolution, and minimising the potential for loss by negligence or malicious attack.The prioritization of collection digitization needs to take all of these factors into consideration in order to balance a collection's preservation needs with its potential for access and exploitation. Issues such as technical obsolescence, succession planning and risk analysis need to be considered along with the organization's strategic business needs such as revenue potential and key stakeholders.This presentation will outline how the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia developed a strategy for the prioritization of all collection items in a consolidated manner that recognized efficiencies and synergies, developed new workflows, harnessed the potential of new technologies, addressed at risk priorities and provided for long term planning."
R. Fox,2013,The art and science of data curation,"Purpose: For the past decade, as universities have increased their research commitments, the production of large data sets has become prevalent. Up to this point, the storage and curation of these data sets has been somewhat ad hoc and voluntary. Given recent mandatory stipulations coming from government funding sources regarding the handling of data sets, it is imperative that libraries step into this gap and provision data management services for their institutions. This column aims to explore two primary areas in which libraries can provision services for their parent institutions regarding data management. Design/methodology/approach: The column is exploratory in nature. Practical implications: As academic libraries take the lead in data management services, there are many positive implications for their parent institutions. Organizing and preserving important data sets could have a significant impact on the worldwide research community. Originality/value: All academic libraries, no matter their size, have a level of responsibility regarding the collection and curation of data sets. This is a responsibility not only to the local institution, but also to the wider scope of researchers who may make use of those data sets. This column is an exhortation for academic libraries to take the lead in the area of data management. © ."

These approaches are meant to support quality assurance and decision making for long term preservation of digital content in libraries and archives. In this paper we demonstrate advantages and drawbacks of different approaches. Our goal is to select the most efficient method which satisfies the digital preservation requirements for duplicate detection in digital document image collections. Workflows of different complexity were designed in order to demonstrate possible duplicate detection approaches. Assessment of individual approaches is based on workflow simplicity, detection accuracy and acceptable performance, since image processing methods typically require significant computation. Applied image processing methods create expert knowledge that facilitates decision making for long term preservation. We employ AI technologies like expert rules and clustering for inferring explicit knowledge on the content of the digital collection. A statistical analysis of the aggregated information and the qualitative analysis of the aggregated knowledge are presented in the evaluation part of the paper. © 2013 ACM."

This was a 'third generation' digital machine that used a CRT to image characters onto photographic paper. The intent was to use existing Linotype fonts and also to develop new ones to exploit the 202's line-drawing capabilities. Use of the 202 was hindered by Mergenthaler's refusal to reveal the inner structure and encoding mechanisms of the font files. The particular 202 was further dogged by extreme hardware and software unreliability. A memorandum describing the experience was written in early 1980 but was deemed to be too sensitive"" to release. The original troff input for the memorandum exists and now, more than 30 years later, the memorandum can be released. However, the only available record of its visual appearance was a poor-quality scanned photocopy of the original printed version. This paper details our efforts in rebuilding a faithful retypeset replica of the original memorandum, given that the Linotron 202 disappeared long ago, and that this episode at Bell Labs occurred 5 years before the dawn of PostScript (and later PDF) as de facto standards for digital document preservation. The paper concludes with some lessons for digital archiving policy drawn from this rebuilding exercise. © 2013 ACM."""

Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on requirements formulated more tersely in the DCMI generic namespace policy for RDF vocabularies. The examination of requirements for linked open vocabularies focuses primarily on property-and-class vocabularies in RDFS or OWL (sometimes called metadata element sets), with some consideration of SKOS concept schemes and Dublin Core application profiles. It also discusses lessons learned through two years of development of the linked open vocabularies (LOV), of which main features and key findings are described. Findings: Key findings about the current practices of vocabulary managers regarding metadata, policy and versioning are presented, as well as how such practices can be improved to ensure better discoverability and usability of RDF vocabularies. The paper presents new ways to assess the links and dependencies between vocabularies. It also stresses the necessity and importance of a global governance of the ecosystem in which vocabulary managers, standard bodies, and memory institutions should engage. Research limitations/implications: The current paper is focused on requirements related to a single type of vocabulary but could and should be extended to other types such as thesauri, classifications, and other semantic assets. Practical implications: Practical technical guidelines and social good practices are proposed for promotion in the Vocabulary Ecosystem (for example, by vocabulary managers). Originality/value: This paper brings together the research and action of several important actors in the vocabulary management and governance field, and is intended to be the basis of a roadmap for action presented at the Dublin Core conference of September 2013 in Lisbon (DC 2013). © ."
T. Creighton,2013,Intelligent storage systems in digital preservation,"Great effort has been expended in making digital preservation repository systems reliable in terms of how they manage the objects within the repository. For the most part, these systems place no more demand on the storage system in which they store their digital objects than any software system places on a POSIX file system. All issues of integrity maintenance tend to be handled by the preservation system itself. For example, regular fixity checks are typically carried out by the preservation system running through its catalog inventory and reading each file stored in the storage system in order to compare with a previously calculated hash value stored in the catalog. This requires the attention of the preservation system itself in most cases. Large simplification and performance gains are to be made by delegating more of these integrity checking and data recovery issues to the storage system. © Copyright 2013; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

We introduce the problem of automated file recognition and classification in emerging digital engineering environments, where all design, manufacturing and production activities are born digital."" The result is that massive quantities and varieties of data objects are created during the product lifecycle. This paper presents an approach to automated identification of engineering file formats. This work operates independent of any modeling tools and can identify families of related file objects as well as variations in versions.

Therefore, a high-resolution and multi-spectral capturing and a large-scale 3D measuring are necessary for the digital archiving of large 3D woven cultural artifact. Then we captured high-resolution images with a two-shot type 6-band image capturing system at low-cost, and modeled woven cultural artifacts in 3D. This paper describes a 3D measurement system with wheel-rail, a capturing system with multi-band camera, and a 3D modeling of large woven cultural artifacts, and show a high-resolution 3D model with multi-band image. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."""
Y. Kim; S. Ross,2013,Closing the loop: Assisting archival appraisal and information retrieval in one sweep,"In this article, we examine the similarities between the concept of appraisal, a process that takes place within the archives, and the concept of relevance judgement, a process fundamental to information retrieval systems. More specifically, we revisit appraisal/selection criteria proposed as a result of archival and digital curation communities, and, compare them to relevance criteria as discussed within information retrieval's literature based discovery. We illustrate how closely these criteria relate to each other and discuss how understanding the relationships between the these disciplines could form a basis for proposing automated appraisal and selection for archival processes and enabling complex queries within information retrieval."

To determine whether recorded data can be read back after long-term preservation, we recorded a pseudorandom data pattern on barium-ferrite media at a linear density of 500 kbpi and baked the media at 65°C for an extended period. After baking, the recorded data were read back using a 0.45-μm-wide giant magnetoresistive read head. The bit error rate was calculated using the GPR4ML-AR model. It was found that the bit error rate was stable even after one year at 65°C. This result indicates that perpendicularly oriented barium-ferrite media has high thermal stability. © 2013 IEEE."
Y. Miyake,2013,Application of spectral imaging to electronic endoscopes,"This chapter deals with image acquisition by CCD-based electronic endoscopes, developed from color film-based recording devices called gastrocameras. The quality of color images, particularly reproduced colors, is influenced significantly by the spectral characteristics of imaging devices, as well as illumination and visual environments. Thus, recording and reproduction of spectral information on the object rather than information on three primary colors (RGB) is required in electronic museums, digital archives, electronic commerce, telemedicine, and electronic endoscopy in which recording and reproduction of high-definition color images are necessary. We have been leading the world in developing five-band spectral cameras for digital archiving (Miyake, Analysis and evaluation of digital color images, 2000; Miyake, Manual of spectral image processing, 2006; Miyake and Yokoyama, Obtaining and reproduction of accurate color images based on human perception, pp 190-197, 1998). Spectral information includes information on all visible light from the object and may be used for new types of recording, measurement, and diagnosis that cannot be achieved with the three primary colors of RGB or CMY. This chapter outlines the principle of FICE (flexible spectral imaging color enhancement), a spectral endoscopic image processing that incorporates such spectral information for the first time. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Daruis,2013,Risk Management for Digital Cultural Heritage Information in Malaysia,"A crucial component of the nation's K-economy envisions the availability of digital content exchange or content infrastructure. The idea of providing and presenting information via electronic means and formats truly fascinates managers of information agencies worldwide. This phenomenon obviously affects the thinking and perception of the managers and administrators of libraries, museums, archives and galleries. Presently, cultural institutions are actively connecting their collections to these emerging knowledge networks. They are creating innovative network services based on the digital surrogates of their current collections in a rich, interactive digital environment. A recent study has been made on the digitisation of cultural heritage resources in cultural institutions in Malaysia, namely the National Library, National Archives, National Museum and the National Art Gallery. The four institutions are currently very active in building their digital content and exploring initiatives to deliver the information, however the extent of sustainability of those resources in unknown. The aim of this paper is investigates the digital preservation strategies that are adopted by Malaysian cultural institutions. A multiple case studies approach is used to examine the potential risks to digital cultural resources in four (4) selected Malaysian cultural institutions. Data is collected through structured interviews with information professionals who are involved in digitisation works in the selected cultural institutions. Findings reveal that digital cultural heritage resources in Malaysia is at risk in terms of digitisation policies, selection criteria, cost, staffing, technology, storage, metadata management and copyright. This study is very significant to professionals who are involved in archiving the digital cultural heritage as it can be a guide for managing risks in preserving valuable digital resources. The result of this study can be a practical tool for managing risks not only for digital cultural heritage but also to all documents in digital format. It also provides an insight to other researchers to seriously investigate other risks of digital cultural resources besides the risks that have been identified in this study."
Z. Xie; H. Van de Sompel; J. Liu; J. van Reenen; R.

Today, all countries with high Internet penetration rate have established high-profile archiving initiatives to crawl and archive the fast-disappearing web content for long-term use. As web technologies evolve, established web archiving techniques face challenges. This paper focuses on the potential impact of the relaxed consistency web design on crawler driven web archiving. Relaxed consistent websites may disseminate, albeit ephemerally, inaccurate and even contradictory information. If captured and preserved in the web archives as historical records, such information will degrade the overall archival quality. To assess the extent of such quality degradation, we build a simplified feed-following application and simulate its operation with synthetic workloads. The results indicate that a non-trivial portion of a relaxed consistency web archive may contain observable inconsistency, and the inconsistency window may extend significantly longer than that observed at the data store. We discuss the nature of such quality degradation and propose a few possible remedies."
Z. Zahidi; Y. P. Lim; P. C. Woods,2013,User experience for digitisation and preservation of cultural heritage,"This paper addresses the importance to integrate user experience (UX) in cultural heritage digitisation and preservation initiatives. UX is an essential consideration that should be acknowledged and implemented when initiating digital culture heritage preservation. It is because UX is beyond the usability of a product or system. It includes both pragmatic (function and features) and hedonic (user expectation, motivation and feelings) factors. These attributes could influence user's positive experience when interacting with the system or product and this will lead to effectiveness of digitisation and preservation activities. The output from this study will propose the approach towards integrating UX and gather insights for future initiatives in establishing cultural and heritage digital preservation that consider effective UX to encourage user satisfaction. © 2013 IEEE."

A. Ahmed; S. Alreyaee; A. Rahman,2014,Theses and dissertations in institutional repositories: An Asian perspective,"Purpose - Institutional repositories constitute an integral part of present day digital libraries allowing global access to scholarly publications and provides an opportunity for future research enhancement and long term preservation of information. Electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) represent a growing segment of available content in institutional repositories where they contribute to the impact and ranking of their institutions. The present study traces the growth and development of online e-theses repositories in Asia within the broader framework of open access. Design/methodology/approach - The present study tries to discover the composition of ETD repositories in Asia based on the seven key parameters, i.e. country, types, language, disciplines, software, content types and repository policies. To achieve the stated objectives, the ETD repositories developed by Asian countries were identified by selecting the database of OpenDOAR (Directory of Open Access Repositories) and the retrieved data were thoroughly analyzed for the necessary information. Findings - Theses and dissertations are considered an important part of information resources in any institution. They are often the only source of research work. Unfortunately, access to these valuable unpublished resources is often restricted to parent institution only. The authors found that ETD repositories are addressing this problem by making institutional knowledge available online and thereby not only increasing its visibility and use, but also making them contribute to the impact and ranking of their institutions. Asian countries are beginning to embrace the idea of digitizing, archiving and making their theses and dissertations available online. The study found that more than half of all IRs listed in the directory of OpenDOAR contain ETDs. ETD system is growing fast in some Asian countries. However, the number of universities having e-theses repositories is meager considering the large number of quality academic and research institutions across Asian countries. Practical implications - The paper argues that ETD repositories not only benefit students and institutions by enhancing education and expanding research, but also by increasing a university’s visibility and use and thereby contributing to the impact and ranking of its parent institutions. Originality/value - The study hopes to heighten awareness of research being conducted in Asia and its contribution to a global knowledge base. Some of the suggestions to improve the existing conditions and strengthen the growth rate of ETDs in Asia are also presented. © ."
A. Das; A. Bucksch; C. A. Price; J. S. Weitz,2014,ClearedLeavesDB: an online database of cleared plant leaf images,"Background: Leaf vein networks are critical to both the structure and function of leaves. A growing body of recent work has linked leaf vein network structure to the physiology, ecology and evolution of land plants. In the process, multiple institutions and individual researchers have assembled collections of cleared leaf specimens in which vascular bundles ( veins) are rendered visible. In an effort to facilitate analysis and digitally preserve these specimens, high-resolution images are usually created, either of entire leaves or of magnified leaf subsections. In a few cases, collections of digital images of cleared leaves are available for use online. However, these collections do not share a common platform nor is there a means to digitally archive cleared leaf images held by individual researchers ( in addition to those held by institutions). Hence, there is a growing need for a digital archive that enables online viewing, sharing and disseminating of cleared leaf image collections held by both institutions and individual researchers.Description: The Cleared Leaf Image Database ( ClearedLeavesDB), is an online web-based resource for a community of researchers to contribute, access and share cleared leaf images. ClearedLeavesDB leverages resources of large-scale, curated collections while enabling the aggregation of small-scale collections within the same online platform. ClearedLeavesDB is built on Drupal, an open source content management platform. It allows plant biologists to store leaf images online with corresponding meta-data, share image collections with a user community and discuss images and collections via a common forum. We provide tools to upload processed images and results to the database via a web services client application that can be downloaded from the database.Conclusions: We developed ClearedLeavesDB, a database focusing on cleared leaf images that combines interactions between users and data via an intuitive web interface. The web interface allows storage of large collections and integrates with leaf image analysis applications via an open application programming interface ( API). The open API allows uploading of processed images and other trait data to the database, further enabling distribution and documentation of analyzed data within the community. The initial database is seeded with nearly 19,000 cleared leaf images representing over 40 GB of image data. Extensible storage and growth of the database is ensured by using the data storage resources of the iPlant Discovery Environment. ClearedLeavesDB can be accessed at http://clearedleavesdb.org."

The first was to assess the digital resources for a department too understaffed to address digital preservation and to provide a step-by-step program for them to start thinking in the long-term. The second was to show how these steps can be generalized for many institutions just starting to have digital holdings and looking to create a long-term digital preservation plan.; Design/methodology/approach – The main method for research involved taking a significant sampling of the department’s digital holdings and conducting an inventory of them, analyzing such characteristics as file size, names, formats and metadata. After the inventory was conducted, recommendations were made to the department based on best practices in the field of digital preservation.; Findings – We found that while the department generally does not follow industry-best practices for preservation, the files were relatively new and, therefore, many issues could still be fixed. With a concrete plan and a bit of effort, their digital files can be more easily accessible and protected against future threats.; Originality/value – The issues that the Department of Special Collections had with their digital holdings are similar to those at many other institutions – especially educational ones where staff turnover is high. This case study could help similar small organizations start to access their digital holdings and start formulating a plan for long-term preservation. © ."

A. Fresa,2014,DIGITAL CULTURAL HERITAGE ROADMAP FOR PRESERVATION,"The amount of data produced by the Cultural Heritage sector is continually increasing thanks to the numerous initiatives put in place by the cultural institutions for the digitization of their content. This process has also been accelerated by the emergence of cultural portals including regional, national and thematic portals and the European cultural portal Europeana. The Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) sector also has the challenge of the complexity of the information itself. This is because of the relationship that each cultural object has with the collections it is part of, with the memory institutions where it is held, with the other objects of the same nature and/or culturally connected with it, and the many other types of relationships that represent the real scientific value of the digitised cultural object (be it a book, an archival record, an artefact from a museum, a sound recording or a video). Further, the investment in the production of the digital cultural heritage data is extremely high because the description of each object requires the human intervention of experts in the sector in order to associate the necessary metadata. Automatic extraction of knowledge (metadata) from the digital representation of cultural items is still far from being at a production level. It is not yet commonly available or seamless to the cultural institutions that are engaged in the digitisation of their collections. In addition to the DCH content that derive from digitisation processes applied to the tangible heritage, also born digital cultural heritage is more and more a reality, particularly in the artistic scenario. Plastic artists are commonly using 3D modelling for their studies. Architects, writers, multimedia artists, graphic designers and almost all other artistic expressions produce data that need to be preserved for the researchers of today and for the future generations. Digital cultural data is therefore extremely precious and its preservation is more and more an imperative priority. This paper intends to discuss these matters in the light of the ongoing work carried out by the DCH-RP project (www.dch-rp.eu) funded by the European Commission. © Edinburgh University Press"

A. Kulmukhametov; C.

However, large-scale profiling is facing a set of challenges. As data grows and gets more diverse, the only option to control it is to combine outputs of multiple characterization tools to cover the varieties of formats and extract features of interest. This cooperation of tools introduces conflicting measures and poses challenges on data quality. Sparsity and labeling conflicts make it difficult or impossible to partition, sample and analyze large metadata sets of a content profile. Without this, however, it is virtually impossible to manage heterogeneous collections reliably over time.; In this paper, we present the content profiling tool C3PO, which includes rule-based techniques and heuristics designed for conflict reduction. We conduct a set of experiments in which we assess the effect of creating such a mechanisms and rule set on the quality and effectiveness of content profiling. The results show the potential of simple conflict reduction rules to strongly improve data quality of content profiling for analysis and decision support. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."

Digital archives of musical scores, on the other hand, usually consist of collections of files, each containing one work in some presentation format (primarily PDF). Both types of collections are technically easy to build, but they have a number of limitations in terms of long-term preservation, data exchange and data re-use, and flexibility. A text-based data structure sophisticated enough to contain both detailed metadata and fully-featured scores may be a way of overcoming some of these limitations and at the same time include catalogue data in the score and vice versa. The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) offers a framework for such an approach based on XML files. The article discusses pros and cons and illustrates some of the possible use cases."

In this paper we show how this integration can be achieved using software developed in the SCAPE project. The SCAPE integration is based on four steps: retrieving the metadata records from the repository, reading the records and their references to data files, updating the records, and storing them back in the repository. This allows full use of the Hadoop system for massively distributed processing without causing excessive load on the repository.We present a proof of concept integration based on repository systems at the Danish State and University Library and the Hadoop execution environment. As a sample collection we use data from the Newspaper Digitisation Project, a collection of more than 30 million JP2 images. The use case is to perform feature extraction and validation of the JP2 images. The validation is done against an institutional preservation policy expressed in the machine readable SCAPE Control Policy vocabulary. The feature extraction will be done using the Jpylyzer tool. We perform an experiment with various-sized sets of JP2 images, to test the scalability and correctness of the solution.We show that it is both possible and beneficial to use this approach when having to perform preservation actions on massive collections stored in traditional digital repositories."
B. C. Björk; M. Laakso; P. Welling; P. Paetau,2014,Anatomy of green open access,"Open access (OA) is free, unrestricted access to electronic versions of scholarly publications. For peerreviewed journal articles, there are two main routes to OA: publishing in OA journals (gold OA) or archiving of article copies or manuscripts at other web locations (green OA). This study focuses on summarizing and extending current knowledge about green OA. A synthesis of previous studies indicates that green OA coverage of all published journal articles is approximately 12%, with substantial disciplinary variation. Typically, green OA copies become available after considerable time delays, partly caused by publisherimposed embargo periods, and partly by author tendencies to archive manuscripts only periodically. Although green OA copies should ideally be archived in proper repositories, a large share is stored on home pages and similar locations, with no assurance of longterm preservation. Often such locations contain exact copies of published articles, which may infringe on the publisher's exclusive rights. The technical foundation for green OA uploading is becoming increasingly solid largely due to the rapid increase in the number of institutional repositories. The number of articles within the scope of OA mandates, which strongly influence the self-archival rate of articles, is nevertheless still low. © 2013 ASIS&T."

Naghshineh,2014,Digital library education in iran: Perspectives of library and information science educators and academic librarians,"This study explores Iranian Library and Information Science (LIS) educators' and academic librarians' viewpoints about a dedicated digital library education programme, as well as solicits proposed models and courses on digital libraries. A survey was administered on a sample of 45 LIS educators and66 academic librarians via an online questionnaire. Responses were analyzed by descriptive statistics (for closed questions) and content analysis (for open-ended questions). Results show that the current LIS education curriculum in Iran does not sufficiently teach LIS students and librarians digital library principles and concepts; in addition, a high majority of LIS educators and academic librarians are in favour of a dedicated digital library education programme. This study provides the empirical data for the design and delivery of a dedicated programme or relevant courses on digital libraries at Iranian library schools, especially at the newly established LIS departments in Iran. Digital librarymanagement, digital preservation, digitization, digital library architecture, and metadata would be the key components in a digital library education programme. Research on digital library education has not been carried out before in Iran. As such, this paper may fill the research gap between theory and practice of Iranian digital librarianship, as well as facilitates LIS departments to design digital library programme and implement the courses in their curriculum."
B. Winston,2014,Personal digital archiving: Guidance and perspectives,"The Library of Congress maintains a digital preservation blog called The Signal. This book contains a series of reformatted posts from that blog on the subject of personal digital archiving. Specifically, the topics include guidance for such things as choosing file formats and adding descriptions to digital photos; first hand accounts of working with and preserving personal collections; descriptions of outreach activities and interviews with library professionals on the subject of personal digital archiving, and many others. Photo albums, letters, home movies and paper documents are a vital link to the past. Personal information we create today has the same value. The only difference is that much of it is now digital. Preserving digital information is a new concept that most people have little experience with. This book provides knowledge and tips to ensure that digital materials last a lifetime by taking steps to preserve them. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved."

C. Becker; E. Cardoso,2014,Report on the capability assessment and improvement workshop (CAIW) at iPres 2013,"While Digital Preservation is making progress in terms of tool development, progressive establishment of standards and increasing activity in user communities, there is a lack of approaches to systematically assessing, comparing and improving how organizations go about achieving their preservation goals. This currently presents a challenge to many organizations for whom digital stewardship is a concern and reveals a substantial gap between theory and practice. To provide an interactive, focused venue for those interested in systematic approaches for assessment and improvement, we organized the first Capability Assessment and Improvement Workshop (CAIW) in Lisbon, on September 5, 2013, as part of the 10th International Conference on Digital Preservation (iPres 2013). This article provides a report on the issues discussed and attempts to synthesize the main conclusions with the intention of stimulating further discussion in the community on this topic. © 2014 Christoph Becker and Elsa Cardoso."
C. Becker; L. Faria; K. Duretec,2014,Scalable decision support for digital preservation,"Purpose-Preservation environments such as repositories need scalable and context-aware preservation planning and monitoring capabilities to ensure continued accessibility of content over time. This article identifies a number of gaps in the systems and mechanisms currently available and presents a new, innovative architecture for scalable decision-making and control in such environments.; Design/methodology/approach-The paper illustrates the state of the art in preservation planning and monitoring, highlights the key challenges faced by repositories to provide scalable decision-making and monitoring facilities, and presents the contributions of the SCAPE Planning and Watch suite to provide such capabilities.; Findings-The presented architecture makes preservation planning and monitoring context-aware through a semantic representation of key organizational factors, and integrates this with a business intelligence system that collects and reasons upon preservation-relevant information.

Integration with repositories and external information sources provide powerful preservation capabilities that can be freely integrated with virtually any repository. Practical implications-The open nature of the software suite enables stewardship organizations to integrate the components with their own preservation environments and to contribute to the ongoing improvement of the systems.; Originality/value-The paper reports on innovative research and development to provide preservation capabilities. The results enable proactive, continuous preservation management through a context-aware planning and monitoring cycle integrated with operational systems. © ."
C. C. Dearborn; A. J. Barton; N. A. Harmeyer,2014,The Purdue University Research Repository: HUBzero customization for dataset publication and digital preservation,"Purpose: The purpose of this case study is to discuss the creation of robust preservation functionality within PURR. The study seeks to discuss the customization of the HUBzero platform, composition of digital preservation policies, and the creation of a novel, machine-actionable metadata model for PURR's unique digital content. Additionally, the study will trace the implementation of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model and track PURR's progress towards Trustworthy Digital Repository certification. Design/methodology/approach: This case study discusses the use of the Center for Research Libraries Trusted Repository Audit Checklist (TRAC) certification process and ISO 16363 as a rubric to build an OAIS institutional repository for the publication, preservation, and description of unique datasets. Findings: ISO 16363 continues to serve as a rubric, barometer and set of goals for PURR as development continues. To become a trustworthy repository, the PURR project team has consistently worked to build a robust, secure, and long-term home for collaborative research. In order to fulfill its mandate, the project team constructed policies, strategies, and activities designed to guide a systematic digital preservation environment. PURR expects to undertake the full ISO 16363 audit process at a future date in expectation of being certified as a Trustworthy Digital Repository. Through its efforts in digital preservation, the Purdue University Research Repository expects to better serve Purdue researchers, their collaborators, and move scholarly research efforts forward world-wide. Originality/value: PURR is a customized instance of HUBzero®, an open source software platform that supports scientific discovery, learning, and collaboration. HUBzero was a research project funded by the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) and is a product of the Network for Computation Nanotechnology (NCN), a multi-university initiative of eight member institutions. PURR is only one instance of a HUBzero's customization; versions have been implemented in many disciplines nation-wide. PURR maintains the core functionality of HUBzero, but has been modified to publish datasets and to support their preservation. Long-term access to published data are an essential component of PURR services and Purdue University Libraries' mission. Preservation in PURR is not only vital to the Purdue University research community, but to the larger digital preservation issues surrounding dynamic datasets and their long-term usability. © ."
C. Coutinho; A. Cretan; R. Jardim-Goncalves,2014,Modelling services for interoperability negotiation,"The evolution of businesses, driven by the advent of the internet and subsequent globalisation, was very quick and sudden. Enterprises that had traditional development strategies and that were used to slow changes are suddenly feeling the urge to evolve or face obsolescence. This fast-paced evolution frequently leads to mistakes and erroneous decisions, many of which are solely detected after a long period. When this happens, frequently the only solution is to return to a previous stable business stage before proceeding. The EU co-funded FP7 TIMBUS project comprises tools and techniques to improve business continuity featuring an intelligent strategy for digital preservation of business assets and environments based on riskmanagement. This paper proposes the modelling of service-based negotiation strategies to help in two phases: First in the definition of the enterprise business interoperability strategy, and second, in the reasoning of assets and concepts needed for the capture of digital preservation of business assets.

C. Da Silva Cunha; C. B. Perez,2014,Digital preservation of photographs,"This study consists of a literature review on digital preservation of photographs, as a set of activities designed to ensure your long-term access. Points digital objects as the representation of information in a sequence of binary digits, whether born digital or arising digitizing analog media, and analyzes the digital preservation of photographs from this concept. Presents strategies for digital preservation of these objects at both the image and the hardware and software. Concludes that the set of strategies chosen should aim to preserve, but also the management and dissemination of photographs, since the major goals of a conservation program are to assure long-term access and disseminate institutional memory or personal account."
C. Fryer; A. Brown,2014,Archives in the Cloud: Challenges and Opportunities,"The Parliamentary Archives is responsible for preserving and providing access to the historical records of the UK Parliament, a collection of national, and indeed international, importance which encompasses a wide range of formats, created and used in an ever changing environment. Since 2010 a staged project has led to the successful implementation of an operational digital repository. The digital repository adopts third-party cloud services as a primary means of storage. The project has demonstrated the viability of using cloud storage providers for digital preservation despite common concerns over their adoption. Using the Parliamentary Archives as a case study this paper will explore in depth the challenges and opportunities resulting from the use of the cloud. Using cloud providers has enabled the provision of a rigorous preservation storage capability which is flexible, scalable, and provides a low barrier to entry. The ingest of content into the cloud and the portability or provisioning of data remains a concern, and this paper will explore whether this undermines the use of the cloud. There can be an inherent tension between the flexibility and rapid change which the cloud enables and archival requirements to preserve and sustain content for the long-term. This paper will demonstrate how the Parliamentary Archives has mitigated these risks and why data portability remains a pressing concern. There are significant technical and organisational challenges involved in maintaining digital materials over time. The cost effectiveness of the cloud over the long-term remains a concern. Cost effectiveness threatens the staged process needed to address current technical and organisational issues which endanger the long term stewardship of parliament's digital content. This experience has highlighted a particularly important consideration in terms of being prepared for managing transition when thinking about cloud services in an archival context. The successful implementation of an advanced digital repository in conjunction with the use of cloud storage services provides an innovative practical application of using the cloud to enable a best practice digital preservation environment. Parliament's experience of addressing authenticity requirements, including issues of reliability, usability, and especially integrity in the cloud will be explored. Cloud providers increasingly recognise the opportunity to tailor their offerings in order to meet the particular needs of specific sectors or industries, and must be encouraged to do so for cultural heritage institutions. This case study can contribute significantly to the debate on adoption of cloud services for the management and preservation of digital records. This paper aims to help in shaping the debate around the emerging archival marketplace by outlining current and future issues associated with cloud services. By highlighting issues associated with data portability and cost effectiveness of cloud services this paper aims encourage debate between archives and cloud service providers. Despite concerns over the use of cloud services for digital preservation, the Parliamentary Archives experience shows that with the right application robust preservation environments can be achieved."
C. Li; S. Sugimoto,2014,Provenance description of metadata using PROV with PREMIS for long-term use of metadata,"Provenance description is necessary for long-term preservation of digital resources. Open Archival Information System (OAIS) and Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS), which are well-known standards designed for digital preservation, define descriptive elements for digital preservation. Metadata has to be preserved as well as primary resource in order to keep the primary resources alive. However, due to the changing technology and information context, not only primary digital resources but also metadata are at risk of damage or even loss. Thus, metadata preservation is important as well as preservation of primary digital resources. Metadata preservation is a rather new research topic but critical for keeping metadata about preserved resources consistently over time. This paper focuses on provenance as an important issue in digital preservation. It discusses provenance description based on two major metadata standards - PROV and PREMIS. The goal of this study is to clarify a model for describing provenance for metadata preservation. This paper first describes some well-known standards - OAIS, PREMIS, PROV, and so forth, and then discusses a novel model of provenance description based on the PROV Ontology (PROV-O) and PREMIS OWL Ontology. The paper gives provenance description examples using PROV-O and PREMIS OWL Ontology respectively. Based on analysis and mapping among the basic classes of the PROV-O and PREMIS OWL Ontology, we propose an integrated, merged model. We discuss metadata schema provenance and some other open issues. © 2014, Dublin Core metadata initiative. All rights reserved."
C. Rivard,2014,Archiving disaster and national identity in the digital realm: The september 11 digital archive and the hurricane digital memory bank,"While the significance of the media's representational force may not be an entirely new insight, the implications of this framing are profound not only for the real lives of those who suffered but also for the way our present becomes the past for the future. In other words, the archive itself is not simply a refl tion or an image of an event but also shapes the event, the phenomena of its origins"" (Blouin and Rosenberg 2006, 2). Therefore, the content and structure of the two archives effectively create enduring cultural memories of the respective event. There is little doubt that these two digital archives will be seen as marking an important change in the way archives are constructed: they demonstrate the Internet's power to collect ephemera material concerning a nation's thoughts and feelings to an extent never before imagined. Moreover, because this archival material is stored on the World Wide Web, it is also readily available for viewing by a world- wide audience. Without critically analyzing the disparity in the contributions by indirect witnesses between these first two instances of digital archiving and its consequences for questions of national identity, one may gloss over or even forget the profoundly racialized, gendered, and classed society that the two events underscore amid the increasingly celebrated multicultural rhetoric. Thus, ana- lyzing the production and content of these two archives alongside one another demonstrates that those issues of power do not subside as archives are made more inclusive through the use of the Internet. © 2014 The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System."""

D. S. H. Rosenthal,2014,Architectural choices in LOCKSS networks,"Purpose: The LOCKSS digital preservation technology collects, preserves and disseminates content in peer-to-peer networks. Many such networks are in use. The Global LOCKSS Network (GLN) is an open network with many nodes in which libraries preserve academic journals and books that they purchase. The CLOCKSS network is a closed network, managed by a non-profit consortium of publishers and libraries to form a dark archive of e-journal content. There are also many Private LOCKSS Networks (PLNs) preserving various genres of content. Each of these networks is configured to meet the specific requirements of its community and the content it preserves. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes these architectural choices and discusses a development that could enable other configurations. Findings: Third-party rights databases would allow hosted LOCKSS networks. Practical implications: Hosted LOCKSS networks would be cheaper. Originality/value: Reducing cost of digital preservation is important in a time of strained library budgets. © ."
D. Savic; G. St-Pierre,2014,Digital preservation at International Nuclear Information System (INIS),"Since its creation in 1970 until 1996 (INIS, 2010), the International Nuclear Information System (INIS)i collected and converted to microfiche over 312 000 non-conventional literature (NCL) reports received from member states and international organizations. The microfiche collection contains over 1 million items, with an estimated total of 25 million pages of full-texts. In 1997, the INIS Secretariat replaced the microfiche-based production system with an imaging system to process and to disseminate all NCL documents in electronic format. That marked the beginning of digital preservation efforts that still continue today. This paper provides an overview of the digital preservation practices and the technical infrastructure of INIS. It describes the technical processes, the standards in place, the hardware and software used, as well as all practices related to scanning, quality control, OCR, preservation and storage."
D. Wehrle; T. Liebetraut; I. Valizada; K. Rechert,2014,Emulation-as-a-service - Workflows and infrastructure to support recomputable science,"The computational age and its fast technological progress boosted research output of almost all disciplines. However, these early benefits come along with a burden: while the exchange of research data and ideas is easier and more effective than ever, assuring both short- and long-term access to fundamental scientific methods is more difficult than anticipated. In particular, functional access to data processing methods, tool-chains and scientific workflows is indispensable in order to verify and replicate research findings. This article is proposing emulation as a technique for generalization of data processing environments, serving as first step towards long-term accessibility of research data and associated methods. We present a Cloud-based emulation-as-a-service framework for publication and citation of scientific workflows and research data, since having re-usable processing environments, emulation can be used for technical verification of research data, i.e. Ensure minimal quality assurance like completeness and an explicit list of potential external dependencies, fundamental for future risk-assessment. © 2014 IEEE."
D.

This development has provided literary archives with a problem, as digital literary estates are difficult to process using established longterm preservation strategies on account of their individual and unique nature. According to the proposal put forward in this paper, the creators should instead be involved in the long-term preservation, and literary archives should also integrate precustodial forms of collection care within their range of tasks. The article outlines the use of a cloud architecture as a suitable instrument for accomplishing this task. It serves authors as a digital work environment, and simultaneously also the literary archives as a preliminary stage before the long-term repository. The added benefits and prospects of such a literature archive cloud are set forth and discussed."
D. Wershler; K. A. Sinervo; S. Tien,2014,Unauthorized comic book scanners,"This chapter uses theories of circulation, subculture, and materiality to discuss the activities of unauthorized comic book scanners or pirates,"" and the mechanisms by which they structure their community. The discussion is drawn from a body of quantitative data collected by observing the circulation of unauthorized comic scans through several BitTorrent Websites between 2005 and 2012. The authors also examine the public discourse of scanners themselves-showcased through various anonymous interviews- as part of an investigation into the scanners' identification with a system of ethics that validates their dissemination of unauthorized content in the name of preservation or ""digital archiving."" Lastly, the authors propose a methodology for the study of digital media as ""space-biased"" and circulatory rather than archival. Though comic book scanners may identify themselves as digital archivists, they are somewhat unreliable for actual preservation. However, the ongoing existence of their community, despite the illegal, anonymous, and ephemeral nature of their work, invites one to consider the merits of a knowledge propagation model based on dissemination over preservation. © 2014 by IGI Global.

It proposes a novel editable text method to represent the multidimensional tree-like information structure of the Kunqu libretto literature and a musical semantic annotation method based on numbered musical notation to accommodate the musical features of Kunqu librettos. To maintain the characteristics of the original Kunqu musical notation, it proposes a method to reconstruct Kunqu libretto on theWeb based on scalable vector graphics. Some Kunqu librettos were randomly selected for experiments, and the results demonstrated that the editable text method and the musical semantic annotation method were able to fully represent the effective information of the Kunqu libretto literature and that the method to reconstruct librettos on theWeb was able to reflect the writing characteristics of the musical notation in the original librettos. Finally, it discusses the primary future research directions related to digital Kunqu, including Kunqu libretto metadata research, corpus construction for the librettos and Qupai (the unique ancient Chinese tune mode), libretto music information disambiguation research, libretto image segmentation and pattern recognition, digital Kunqu roles, digital Kunqu stages, digital Kunqu costume suitcases, virtual Kunqu, digitization and restoration of Kunqu cultural relics, and Kunqu's application prospects in conventional media such as animation, anime, and movies. © 2014 ACM."

G. J. Van Bussel; N. Smit,2014,"Building a green archiving model: Archival retention levels, information value chain and green computing","Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) affect the environment in various ways. Their energy consumption is growing exponentially, with and without the use of 'green' energy. Increasing environmental awareness within information science has led to discussions on sustainable development. 'Green Computing' has been introduced: the study and practice of environmentally sustainable computing. This can be defined as 'designing, manufacturing, using, and disposing of computers, servers, and associated subsystems - such as monitors, printers, storage devices, and networking and communications systems - efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment'. Nevertheless, the data deluge makes it not only necessary to pay attention to the hard- and software dimensions of ICTs but also to the value of the data stored. We explore the possibilities to use information and archival science to reduce the amount of stored data. In reducing this amount of stored data, it's possible to curb unnecessary power consumption. The objectives of this paper are to develop a model (and test its viablility) to [1] increase awareness in organizations for the environmental aspects of data storage, [2] reduce the amount of stored data, and [3] reduce power consumption for data storage. This model integrates the theories of Green Computing, Information Value Chain (IVC) and Archival Retention Levels (ARLs). We call this combination 'Green Archiving'. Our exploratory research was a combination of desk research, qualitative interviews with information technology and information management experts, a focus group, and two exploratory case studies. This paper is the result of the first stage of a research project that is aimed at developing low power ICTs that will automatically appraise, select, preserve or permanently delete data based on their value. Such an ICT will automatically reduce storage capacity and curb power consumption used for data storage. At the same time, data disposal will reduce overload caused by storing the same data in different formats, it will lower costs and it reduces the potential for liability. © The Authors, 2014.

H. Park; R. P. Smiraglia,2014,Enhancing data curation of cultural heritage for information sharing: A case study using open government data,"The purpose of this paper is to enhance cultural heritage data curation. A core research question of this study is how to share cultural heritage data by using ontologies. A case study was conducted using open government data mapped with the CIDOC-CRM (Conceptual Reference Model). Twelve library- related files in unstructured data format were collected from an open government website, Seoul Metropolitan Government of Korea (http://data.seoul.go.kr). By using the ontologies of the CIDOC CRM 5.1.2, we conducted a mapping process as a way of enhancing cultural heritage information to share information as a data component. We graphed each file then mapped each file in tables. Implications of this study are both the enhanced discoverability of unstructured data and the reusability of mapped information. Issues emerging from this study involve verification of detail for complete compatibility without further input from domain experts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."
H. Zimmermann,2014,New challenges for the archiving of digital writing,"In his article New Challenges for the Archiving of Digital Writing"" Heiko Zimmermann discusses the challenges of the preservation of digital texts. In addition to the problems already at the focus of attention of digital archivists, there are elements in digital literature which need to be taken into consideration when trying to archive them. Zimmermann analyses two works of digital literature, the collaborative writing project A Million Penguins (2006-2007) and Ren裠Tuner's She (2008) and shows how the ontology of these texts is bound to elements of performance, to direct social interaction of writers and readers to the uniquely subjective reading process, and to real-time access to data. Zimmermann posits that these features of the digital text pose further challenges for digital archiving and libraries. © Purdue University."""
I. Andersson; G. Lindqvist; F. Randers,2014,Preservation Services Planning: A Decision Support Framework,"Commercial organizations are experiencing a growing need to access business-critical data in the longer term of their operations. Governmental regulations as well as commercial interests influence this need. Organizations are willing to procure cost-effective services to this end - services that are increasingly based as public or private cloud solutions. With the advent of autonomous cloud services comes the possibility to assemble (mix and match) preservation services in a workflow-based service-oriented solution. Following the interaction with information managers in (three) commercial organizations operating in different markets and after a review of current literature, we have revealed a lack of comprehensive guidelines and decision support in service selection as part of preservation planning. Existing models and frameworks used for assessing the quality of preservation services either manage performance-based features that service provider's offer or the technical details of the preservation actions themselves. In this paper we present our preservation-planning framework (Preserv-Qual) that addresses the need for decision support in the selection of preservation services that explicitly acknowledge the differences among aspects of information use within an organization. We describe the outcome from an evaluation of the framework in three commercial organisations as a service quality assessment and decision support tool. This paper shows how our framework supports the use of existing and proven methods, models and principles for service assessment, digital preservation and decision support."
I. Badiu; D. Popescu; A. Cenusa; Z. Buna; R. Comes,2014,USING CAD SOFTWARE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DATA IN CASE OF DIGITAL PRESERVATION OF THE CULTURAL HERITAGE,"Ceramic vessels reconstruction is one of the most time consuming tasks in archaeology. If the original vessels are axially symmetric, the reconstruction can be completely characterized by their profile. Extracting the profile thus becomes the first step of the reconstruction analysis. Automatic generation of profiles can be done using different CAD software, increasing the accuracy and efficiency of the reconstruction process. On the other hand, archiving digital 3D reconstructed models is a real problem since ceramic vessels are the most common artefacts found in archaeological sites. This paper proposes a methodology to reduce the amount of data required for vessel digital preservation. The basic idea is to use a parameterized NUPBS curve and data storage in order to generate different vessel families by using two files, a 3D parameterized model and a file with the parameter values."

For this aim, the current technologies for digital audio-visual media preservation deal with complex technological, organizational, economic and rights-related issues. Ensuring the development and use of high-quality software could be a key factor for their success. The paper reports an experience matured inside the Presto4U project, with the contribution of the TATE Gallery. Aim of the experiment was the identification of preservation needs and corresponding preservation requirements in order to set up a quality evaluation process for used software tools making easy the technology transfer of research results into digital preservation environment. Using the framework of the international standards on software products quality, the evaluation requirements were mapped on the characteristics and sub-characteristics of a quality model and a specification of high-level software product quality evaluation plan has been obtained and presented."
I. O. Sanya; E. M. Shehab,2014,An ontology framework for developing platform-independent knowledge-based engineering systems in the aerospace industry,"This paper presents the development of a novel knowledge-based engineering (KBE) framework for implementing platform-independent knowledge-enabled product design systems within the aerospace industry. The aim of the KBE framework is to strengthen the structure, reuse and portability of knowledge consumed within KBE systems in view of supporting the cost-effective and long-term preservation of knowledge within such systems. The proposed KBE framework uses an ontology-based approach for semantic knowledge management and adopts a model-driven architecture style from the software engineering discipline. Its phases are mainly (1) Capture knowledge required for KBE system; (2) Ontology model construct of KBE system; (3) Platform-independent model (PIM) technology selection and implementation and (4) Integration of PIM KBE knowledge with computer-aided design system. A rigorous methodology is employed which is comprised of five qualitative phases namely, requirement analysis for the KBE framework, identifying software and ontological engineering elements, integration of both elements, proof of concept prototype demonstrator and finally experts validation. A case study investigating four primitive three-dimensional geometry shapes is used to quantify the applicability of the KBE framework in the aerospace industry. Additionally, experts within the aerospace and software engineering sector validated the strengths/benefits and limitations of the KBE framework. The major benefits of the developed approach are in the reduction of man-hours required for developing KBE systems within the aerospace industry and the maintainability and abstraction of the knowledge required for developing KBE systems. This approach strengthens knowledge reuse and eliminates platform-specific approaches to developing KBE systems ensuring the preservation of KBE knowledge for the long term. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

J. H. Teper,2014,Selection for Preservation A Survey of Current Practices in the Field of Preservation,"Library preservation programs are at the precipice of transformation. With the increasing availability of digitized content, and the development of shared print repositories, our perceived obligation to the preservation of individual print copies at an institutional level is shifting to a more shared model. Library preservation professionals must now determine how this is influencing our day to day practices. This paper reviews the data collected from a 2012 survey and interprets that data to show how the availability of digital surrogates, libraries' increasing consideration of shared print holdings, and the perceived value of scarcely held content are all influencing preservation selection."

J. J. Otto,2014,Administrative metadata for long-term preservation and management of resources: A survey of current practices in ARL libraries,"An institutional repository is, among other things, a means to preserve an organization's scholarly output or resources in a variety of digital media and across disciplines. Administrative metadata are critical to the preservation of these digital resources. This study, which surveyed fifty-four Association of Research Libraries (ARL) institutional repositories about their administrative metadata, was designed to create a snapshot of current metadata practices. It revealed no true consensus of administrative metadata accommodated and collected by the repositories. Moreover, responses throughout the survey indicate that in general, organizations are neither accommodating nor recording administrative metadata to any significant extent. If research libraries are to provide permanent, organized, and secure repositories for institutional scholarship and special collections, they must identify core metadata in the context of repository objectives, explore barriers to collection of administrative metadata, and strategize as to how those barriers might be mitigated or overcome."

J. Ray,2014,Putting Museums in the Data Curation Picture,"For the past several decades, museums worldwide have recognized the need to digitize their collection records and images. The global reach of the web has increased the urgency of this work in order to make museum collections and information accessible to online users. Museums in Europe and North America are now routinely digitizing all collection objects as they are acquired and loaned, not only for access purposes but also as documentation in the event of loss, damage, or theft of the physical originals. Increasingly, museums are also acquiring born-digital content such as digital media art, historical data in digital formats, and scientific research data. The creation and acquisition of digital assets is expanding at a rapid pace, and museums now have a critical need for professionals in the field who know how to manage and preserve digital assets and who will participate in the development of standards and policies for the creation, management, preservation, exchange, and use of digital data. The establishment of the Digital Curation Centre in the UK in 2004 and the publication of government reports in the US and Europe calling for the preservation of scientific data (National Science Board 2004; Blue Ribbon Task Force 2008, 2010; High Level Expert Group 2010) has spurred the growth of digital curation. In the US, these developments fortuitously coincided with the creation of a new federal funding program to increase the number of graduates from library and information science (LIS) master's and doctoral programs, and which has supported the development and integration of digital curation into LIS education (Manjarraz et al. 2010). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."

K. Breckenridge,2014,The Politics of the Parallel Archive: Digital Imperialism and the Future of Record-Keeping in the Age of Digital Reproduction,"This paper takes as its subject the fact that digital archival production - of existing materials and born-digital records - has collapsed in contemporary South Africa, and it offers some arguments about why it is important to reverse this process. The current situation can be explained by the fact that digitisation has been widely described as a form of intellectual imperialism, a characterisation that echoes influential strands of postcolonial theory and South African nationalism. The reasons for this unusual understanding lie in the difficult history of the last major digitisation effort, the Mellon-funded collaboration between Aluka and the Digital Imaging Project of South Africa (DISA). The paper reconstructs that project in some detail in an effort to understand what went wrong, arguing that in place of the geopolitical explanation that many participants adopted, most of what went wrong was much more narrowly technological. Yet, the same technological issues have already been great assets to South African researchers, holding out the promise of solutions to some pressing local difficulties of digital preservation and archival assembly. The last section of the paper takes up some of the reasons why scholars need to take digital record-keeping much more seriously than they have to date - chief amongst these being the fertile possibilities of forgery and impersonation. © 2014 The Editorial Board of the Journal of Southern African Studies."

Input, output, and intermediate results are pure digital objects. Keeping such data accessible and meaningful but even more importantly keeping the business processes functional is challenging. With regards to complex electronic business processes traditional archiving does not provide satisfactory results. Due to the fast technical life-cycle the time gap between archiving and re-enactment or reuse of a process poses risks and increases the uncertainty on achievable results. We propose a novel strategy bridging this specific time gap. For this we present a scalable and cost-effective infrastructure with associated workflows focusing on a process' execution context. Most importantly the process' developers are able to assess the preserved results in a timely manner, and thus, reduce the uncertainty on future re-enactment results."

While concerted efforts have been made in the library community to encourage common standards, digital preservation policies regularly vary from one digital library service to another. In the interest of gaining a broad view of contemporary digital preservation practice in North American research libraries, this paper presents the findings of a study of file format policies at Association of Research Libraries (ARL) member institutions. It is intended to present the digital preservation community with an assessment of the level of trust currently placed in common file formats in digital library collections and institutional repositories. Beginning with a summary of file format research to date, the authors describe the research methodology they used to collect and analyze data from the file format policies of ARL Library repositories and digital library services. The paper concludes with a presentation and analysis of findings that explore levels of confidence placed in image, text, audio, video, tabular data, software application, presentation, geospatial, and computer program file formats. The data show that file format policies have evolved little beyond the document and image digitization standards of traditional library reformatting programs, and that current approaches to file format policymaking must evolve to meet the challenges of research libraries' expanding digital repository services. © 2014 Kyle Rimkus, Thomas Padilla, Tracy Popp and Greer Martin."

L. Molloy,2014,Digital curation skills in the performing arts – an investigation of practitioner awareness and knowledge of digital object management and preservation,"This study examines the digital curation awareness and practice of a sample of practitioners from the UK performing arts community. Twelve performance arts practitioners from across the United Kingdom were interviewed to establish understanding of whether, why and how they create and manage digital objects in the course of their creative work. Detailed qualitative data from this series of one-to-one interviews about the actual and intended digital curation practices of these performance arts practitioners establish what they understand about sustainable management of digital objects, and also which digital curation activities they actually include in their working processes. This knowledge is supplemented with some preliminary exploration of the types of digital resources that are sought and used by performance arts practitioners, in order to understand whether there is a comparable appetite for the creation and for the reuse of digital objects in this field. Questions in the interview identify the sources used by practitioners when attempting to access digital objects created by others as part of research for their own creative work. This provides a ‘practitioner's-eye view’ of performance collections; that is to say, the resources used by practitioners as collections for research, irrespective of the formal designation or intended purpose of such resources. Here, this enquiry is set into the broader context of digital curation and preservation. The approach to the interviewing is described, findings are discussed and the presence of possible skills and knowledge gaps is presented. Concluding remarks indicate the implications of these indicative findings for the representation of performance arts practice for current and future generations, and suggest useful future areas of enquiry. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

Borbinha,2014,A digital preservation-legal ontology,"Digital preservation has the goal of ensuring long-term access to data, enabling future users not only to benefit from today's knowledge, but also to reuse such knowledge. Therefore, the digital preservation of a business process has the aim of enabling the use of the preserved process data so that its re-execution is possible. Law is becoming an essential application domain for technology developments, such as digital preservation. For instance, the digital preservation of copyright protected data might infringe the exclusive rights of the copyright holder. However, problems with the legal domain can arise since DP users and law-makers do not share the same perspective and concepts. Ontologies can be used to improve communication and shared understanding, giving rise to greater reuse, sharing, transparency, and interoperability. This paper presents a legal ontology that provides a hierarchical overview of how legal constraints and obligations (e.g. IP rights and licensing issues) could be enforced automatically in DP systems. The correctness of our legal ontology is validated with a set of competency questions defined in a specific case study. The aim is to obtain a clearer taxonomical view of the necessary legal knowledge that will address the concerns of industrial use-case DP stakeholders.

The rediscovery of missing Web pages is, therefore, a relevant research topic in the digital preservation as well as in the Information Retrieval realm.

We investigate the retrieval performance of the methods individually as well as their combinations and give an insight into how effective these methods are over time. As the main result of this work, we are able to recommend not only the best performing methods but also the sequence in which they should be applied, based on their performance, complexity required to generate them, and evolution over time. Our least complex single method results in a rediscovery rate of almost 70% of Web pages of our sample dataset based on URIs sampled from the Open Directory Project (DMOZ). By increasing the complexity level and combining three different methods, our results show an increase of the success rate of up to 77%.

In compliance with good scientific practice data need to be published, accessible, and re-usable. The RADAR project has accepted this challenge and aims to establish a generic infrastructure, which will provide archiving and publication services for research data. Target groups are scientists (e.g., in projects) and institutions (e.g., libraries). Both groups are offered a two-stage approach with a cross-discipline starter package for format-independent data preservation with a minimum metadata set and a superior package for preserving data with integrated data publication. The thematic emphasis of RADAR is on the «small sciences», which often lack sufficient research data infrastructure. The RADAR infrastructure will provide the opportunity of temporary or - in case of data publication - long-term preservation of research data. Using a self-supporting business model, RADAR will offer one-off payments and institutional subscription services. As such, RADAR is intended to become an integral part of the international information infrastructure which also allows the integration of third-party services."

Jakšić Krüger,2014,The structure and evolution of scientific collaboration in Serbian mathematical journals,"Digital preservation of scientific papers enables their wider accessibility, but also provides a valuable source of information that can be used in a longitudinal scientometric study. The Electronic Library of the Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (eLib) digitizes the most prominent mathematical journals printed in Serbia. In this paper, we study a co-authorship network which represents collaborations among authors who published their papers in the eLib journals in an 80 year period (from 1932 to 2011). Such study enables us to identify patterns and long-term trends in scientific collaborations that are characteristic for a community which mainly consists of Serbian (Yugoslav) mathematicians. Analysis of connected components of the network reveals a topological diversity in the network structure: the network contains a large number of components whose sizes obey a power-law, the majority of components are isolated authors or small trivial components, but there is also a small number of relatively large, non-trivial components of connected authors. Our evolutionary analysis shows that the evolution of the network can be divided into six periods that are characterized by different intensity and type of collaborative behavior among eLib authors. Analysis of author metrics shows that betweenness centrality is a better indicator of author productivity and long-term presence in the eLib journals than degree centrality. Moreover, the strength of correlation between productivity metrics and betweenness centrality increases as the network evolves suggesting that even more stronger correlation can be expected in the future. © 2014, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."

While scanning, the user sees a live view of the current reconstruction, allowing him to intervene immediately and to adapt the sensor path to the current scanning result. After a raw reconstruction has been acquired, we interactively warp the digital model to fit a geo-referenced map using a handle based deformation paradigm. Even large sites can be scanned within a few minutes, and no costly postprocessing is required. We developed our prototype in cooperation with researchers from the field of ancient history and geography and extensively tested the system under real world conditions on an archeological excavation in Metropolis, Ionia, Turkey. The quality of the acquired digitized raw 3D models is evaluated by comparing them to actual imagery and a geo-referenced map of the excavation site. Our reconstructions can be used to take virtual measurements that are often required in research and are the basis for a digital preservation of our cultural heritage. In addition, digital models are a helpful tool for teaching as well as for edutainment purposes making such information accessible to the general public. © 2014 All rights reserved."

Digital curation, in education, can be understood as the collection, organization, interpretation, summary, and sharing of online resources by learners on a topic of inquiry. This research reports on a blended digital curation learning design integrated into a third-year university course. A digital curation activity sequence development process and the classroom activity structure form the basis of the educational implementation presented here. In theory, digital curation activities can support the sharing of collected resources between learners. In practice, digital curation learning activities in higher education can also support blended and flipped classroom engagement models while providing opportunities for the development of critical thinking skills. The chapter describes the activities, the learning design, and the outcomes of a digital curation activity sequence. This provides other educators with a learning design roadmap for engaging students in pre-lecture activities or blended learning that adds value to classroom lectures. © 2015, IGI Global."
P. A. Rad; J. Nilsson; T. Paivarinta,2014,Administration of Digital Preservation Services in the Cloud Over Time: Design Issues and Challenges for Organizations,"In organizations, information systems produce increasing amounts of digital information that needs to be preserved. Simultaneously, human intervention in preservation activities needs to be minimized, due to scarce resources available for preservation. Thus, digital preservation services need to be integrated with other organizational information systems as seamlessly as possible, and preservation activities need to be maximally automated. Selection of adequate cloud-based preservation services poses yet another set of challenges for reaching the seamless integration and automation. Two sources of challenges relate to administrating integrated digital preservation and information systems. Firstly, information systems change over time. Secondly, digital preservation services change over time. This paper contributes by identifying and analyzing scenarios and design issues of administering digital preservation in connection to the changes in information systems and preservation services over time. We also suggest seven generic tasks of the preservation administration"" component, which are needed between digital preservation services and information systems and discuss about the choices of locating the operative responsibilities and middleware."""

An infusion of digital curation competencies into the LIS curriculum will ensure that students pursuing related professions-including archivists, museum technicians, librarians, and conservators-are also prepared to serve as stewards of our digital treasure. The unintended consequence of this approach may well be the sustainability of Digital Curation courses and, therefore, Digital Curation curricula.

Unfortunately many different kinds of finite element mesh formats exist. These different formats can make it difficult to handle the meshes in several aspects, for example when the same simulation should be checked and validated by another program or to preserve these data for long term. For both cases the conversion of finite element meshes can be a solution, however there is another problem in this case, that the size of the meshes are constantly increasing and meshes with over a million elements are commonly used nowadays. This paper would like to discuss how such large meshes can be converted in a parallel fashion and it also presents how this method can be used in the preservation and storage of finite element meshes. © 2014 IEEE."

R. Altenhöner; U. Junger; U. Schwens,2014,Innovation as a strategic choice at the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek,"Like libraries and librarianship in general, the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek (DNB) has in recent years been confronted with technology-driven changes in the information environment. These changes mean a considerable challenge in terms of the mandate of the DNB and the way to fulfill it. To cite one important example: how will DNB deal with a collection mandate extended to digital publications of all kinds, including the obligation to record these publications and make them available for current and future generations? How does it manage to remain a highly visible lighthouse in the seas of data and information? This will not happen accidentically, but will be the result of careful planning, determined actions, and continuous monitoring, based on a clear strategy and a systematic approach, and it means that processes and functions will have to be revised, terminated or newly established. The DNB has always considered itself as an innovative institution – the necessity to be open for recurring innovations and to initiate such developments has become more and more urgent. The DNB has, therefore, started a strategic process in 2013 to respond to this requirement. This process is new to the institution and its members and demands a lot of learning and preparation. A major first step was the definition of strategic goals for the years 2013 to 2016, complemented by a project for organizational development. These goals help the DNB to focus itself and they serve as a guideline for prioritizing projects and tasks. Examples for strategic priorities are a substantial increase in the collection of digital and web resources, development and implementation of automated cataloguing processes, stepping up digitization efforts, and building up an infrastructure for long-term preservation of digital content. However, there are other areas to be attended to and other challenges to be met – the strategic process and the organizational development are, for DNB, tools to continuously follow-up on innovation. This article intends to address the topic coming from two directions: On the one hand we describe the process development in DNB, and on the other hand we name examples and working areas, which might be relevant factors to successfully master the future. © The Author(s) 2014."

Medeiros,2014,A provenance-based approach to manage long term preservation of scientific data,"Long term preservation of scientific data goes beyond the data, and extends to metadata preservation and curation. While several researchers emphasize curation processes, our work is geared towards assessing the quality of scientific (meta)data. The rationale behind this strategy is that scientific data are often accessible via metadata - and thus ensuring metadata quality is a means to provide long term accessibility. This paper discusses our quality assessment architecture, presenting a case study on animal sound recording metadata. Our case study is an example of the importance of periodically assessing (meta)data quality, since knowledge about the world may evolve, and quality decrease with time, hampering long term preservation. © 2014 IEEE."
R. Barbau; J. Lubell; S. Rachuri; S. Foufou,2014,Towards a reference architecture for archival systems: Use case with product data,"Long-term preservation of product data is imperative for many organizations. A product data archive should be designed to ensure information accessibility and understanding over time. Approaches, such as the Open Archival Information System Reference Model (OAIS RM) and the Audit and Certification of Trustworthy Digital Repositories (ACTDR), provide a framework for conceptually describing and evaluating archives. These approaches are generic and do not focus on particular contexts or content types such as product data. Moreover, these approaches offer no guidance on how to formally and comprehensively describe archival systems. Such descriptions should include the business activities that a product data archive has to support and the systems that interact with the archive. Enterprise architecture provides a means to describe systems in their potentially complex environments. This paper proposes a holistic approach to formally describe the architecture and the environment of archival systems. This approach relies on the formal representation of the preservation terminology, including OAIS concepts, using the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF). The approach covers the various interactions of other business functions with the archive and the information models necessary to ensure preservation and accessibility of product data. This approach is a step towards a reference architecture for the formal description of archival systems. To demonstrate the approach, we formally describe the ingest of product data related to a ship. The resulting description uses the preservation terminology defined in the OAIS Reference Model. It facilitates the understanding of how the preservation solution is actually implemented and provides evidence that the solution is able to preserve product data and make it accessible.

The model is intended as a self-evaluation tool: organizations that host and/or manage digital collections can use the Score model to identify the potential threats to the long-term viability and accessibility of digital collections. In contrast to OATS-oriented tools such as ISO 16363, the Score model is aimed towards smaller institutions, who have limited technical and organizational competencies. The criteria in this checklist are grouped around seven sections, in each of which a limited number of criteria are given, using as little technical jargon as possible. The resulting report can be used as a planning tool to systematically tackle the threats to digital preservation. By introducing risk levels, organizations are triggered to prioritize actions and to focus on measurements that are most important to take."
R. Graf; R.

This paper presents the automated quality assurance tools aiming at detection of possible quality issues that supports decision making for document image collections. The main contribution of this research is the implementation of various image processing tools for different error detection scenarios and their combination in to a single tool suite. The tool suite includes: (1) The matchbox tool for accurate near-duplicate detection in document image collections, based on SIFT feature extraction. (2) The finger detection tool aims at automatic detection of fingers that mistakenly appear in scans from digitized image collections, which uses processing techniques for edge detection, local image information extraction and its analysis for reasoning on scan quality. (3) The cropping error detection tool supports the detection of common cropping problems such as text shifted to the edge of the image, unwanted page borders, or unwanted text from a previous page on the image. Another important contribution of this work is a definition of the quality assurance workflow and its automatic execution for error detection in digital document collections. The presented tool suite detects described errors and presents them for additional manual analysis and collection cleaning. A statistical overview of evaluated data and characteristics like performance and accuracy is delivered. The results of the analysis confirm our hypothesis that an automated approach is able to detect errors with reliable quality, thus making quality control for large digitisation projects a feasible and affordable process. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."

While all media decay, data on magnetic media, solid-state drives and conventional optical disks must be cyclically refreshed over relatively short time frames, requiring energy and labor resources. We propose a Write-Once, Read Forever"" (WORF) module specifically engineered for long-term preservation of digital data. It uses a novel high-density data storage medium based on silver halide, which has been demonstrated to last for more than a century under normal ambient environmental conditions. Once data is written to WORF, energy is needed only for reading no periodic refresh is necessary, and data is both immutable and truly permanent. Human readable text and images are embedded in the WORF module adjacent to the digital data. This text and imagery contains meta information about the media's content, and instructions for decoding for future generations. WORF digital data is stored as microscopic, metallic interference gratings (representing wavelengths or ""colors') embedded in a modern, super-resolution, dye-free, photosensitive emulsion. Wavelengths encode multiple states per data region; current spectroscopic technology makes 400 states per 2 micron diameter data region feasible. Multi-state data architecture within each domain enhances data integrity, error-checking, and accelerates writing and reading for the entire media module."""

The new format combines a digital ECG record into a standard graphical report (PDF). Using the very recent PDFIA-3 standard (ISO 19005-3:2012), we designed a long-term preservation graphic report (such as a standard 3 ×4 or 6×2 ECG printout) in which the original ECG digital data (using the aECG ANSIIHL7 R1-2004 format) is embedded as a compressed attachment. The proposal also includes two wcrys of ensuring conformity between the ECG vector images and the digital data. First, a digital signature is added to guarantee that the document was not modified after creation. Second, specific metadata are inserted to allow a direct digital comparison between the vector ECG printout and the data. To prove the feasibility of the approach, 93 aECGs, selected from different device manufacturers, resolutions and sample rates, were converted into the new format and then validated. Differences between digital data and vector graphics were alwcrys smaller than 0.02 μV, significantly below the typical AID converter resolution."
R.

This is particularly evident in the case of open access information resources. The idea of open access to scientific information resources promotes use of mostly free of charge scientific information resources thus substituting use of fee based access to scientific information resources. Open access has both advantages and disadvantages. Main advantages would be greater visibility of published research, greater accessibility of scientific content in general, higher rates of citations etc. and disadvantages would be questionable quality of peer review, absence of peer review in some cases, charging authors for publishing their articles, lack of long term preservation policy etc. This paper also presents results of a study of use of digital information resources by students enrolled in two university courses at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb over period of three years. The results showed that students prefer digital over printed information resources in researched two courses and that they are oriented more towards use of different types of free information resources for writing their term papers instead use of fee based information resources. © 2014 MIPRO."

Within the High Energy Physics community the Data Preservation in High Energy Physics (DPHEP) group coordinates this effort. CNAF is not only one of the Tier-is for the LHC experiments, it is also a computing center providing computing and storage resources to many other HEP and non-HEP scientific collaborations, including the CDF experiment. After the end of data taking in 2011, CDF is now facing the challenge to both preserve the large amount of data produced during several years of data taking and to retain the ability to access and reuse it in the future. CNAF is heavily involved in the CDF Data Preservation activities, in collaboration with the Fermi lab National Laboratory (FNAL) computing sector. At the moment about 4 PB of data (raw data and analysis-level ntuples) are starting to be copied from FNAL to the CNAF tape library and the framework to subsequently access the data is being set up. In parallel to the data access system, a data analysis framework is being developed which allows to run the complete CDF analysis chain in the long term future, from raw data reprocessing to analysis-level ntuple production. In this contribution we illustrate the technical solutions we put in place to address the issues encountered as we proceeded in this activity."

S. Kutay,2014,Advancing Digital Repository Services for Faculty Primary Research Assets: An Exploratory Study,"The Oviatt Library at California State University Northridge (CSUN) hosts two digital repositories represented by Digital Collections for archival and historical materials, and ScholarWorks institutional repository (IR) for scholarly output. This paper reports on an exploratory study for advancing digital repository services regarding faculty primary research assets created in the course of research and/or collected by scholar custodians of archival materials at CSUN. A survey was distributed to understand: 1) which faculty and departments collect or create primary source assets as part of their research, 2) what types of assets are collected or created, 3) the activities performed to preserve these assets, 4) the level of interest in making primary research documents available online, 5) faculty knowledge of library methods, and 6) attitudes regarding collaboration with the library. This survey functions as part of a needs assessment toward the development of new and enhanced digital repository services to advance research, preservation, data curation, instruction, and exhibition. This knowledge will also help to systematize library and faculty collaboration through the development of policies and workflows that reduce ad hoc re-evaluations and protracted negotiations over the ability of the library to support digital research and instruction projects. © 2014 Elsevier Inc."
s. lee,2014,Internal Structure of Information Packages in Digital Preservation,"The description of preserved resources is one of the requirements in digital preservation. The description is generally created in the format of metadata records, and those records are combined to generate information packages to support the process of digital preservation. However, current strategies or models of digital preservation may not generate information packages in efficient ways. To overcome these problems, this research proposed an internal structure of information packages in digital preservation. In order to construct the internal structure, this research analyzed existing metadata standards and cataloging rules such as Dublin Core, MARC, and FRBR to extract the core elements of resource description. The extracted elements were categorized according to their semantics and functions, which resulted in three categories of core elements. These categories and core elements were manifested by using RDF syntax in order to be substantially applied to combine metadata records in digital preservation. Although the internal structure is not intended to create metadata records, it is expected to provide an alternative approach to enable combining existing metadata records in the context of digital preservation in a more flexible way."

S. M. Mutula,2014,Status of digital heritage preservation management in Eastern Africa,"Purpose - The primary purpose of this paper was to assess the status of digital heritage preservation management in Eastern Africa. The following research objectives were addressed: investigate digital heritage preservation management in Eastern Africa, find out the content which is prioritized for digital preservation, describe the challenges of digital heritage preservation management in Eastern Africa and propose a framework to address challenges of digital heritage preservation in Eastern Africa.; Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a literature review and an analysis of national digitization efforts in Eastern Africa. The research objectives were addressed using Document Lifecycle and World Summit on Information Society Action Lines 2, 3 and 8 as the theoretical frames.; Findings - Results revealed growing awareness among institutions with statutory responsibility for heritage management about digital heritage preservation in Eastern Africa through the support of international agencies, civil societies and governments. However, institutions with responsibility for heritage management were ill-equipped to function in this role effectively. Content of academic, commercial, parliamentary and judicial and international treaties' values were the preferred candidates for digitization. The findings revealed several challenges hampering digital heritage preservation management: weak policy and regulatory frameworks, limited capacity, inadequate government support and limited connectivity and bandwidth.; Originality/value - Many countries in Eastern Africa are making efforts to preserve their national heritage through digitalization to bridge the content divide between the region and the developed world so as to enhance access by its people, not only to their respective national heritages but also for international information systems knowledge. However, most of these efforts remain undocumented, making it difficult to make comparisons with similar best practices around the world. © ."
S. Rabinovici-Cohen; R. Cummings; S. Fineberg,2014,Self-contained information retention format for future semantic interoperability,"Long term preservation of digital information, including machine generated large data sets, is a growing necessity in many domains. A key challenge to this need is the creation of vendor-neutral storage containers that can be interpreted over time. We describe SIRF, the Self-contained Information Retention Format, which is being developed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) to support this challenge. We define the SIRF components, its metadata, categories and elements, along with some security guidelines. SIRF metadata includes the semantic information as well as schema and ontological information needed to preserve the physical integrity and logical meaning of preservation objects. We also describe how the SIRF logical format is serialized for storage containers in the cloud and for tape based containers. Aspects of SIRF serialization for the cloud are being experimented with OpenStack Swift object storage in the ForgetIT EU project."
S. Schrimpf; C. Keitel,2014,Nestor guideline for preservation planning - A process model,"The nestor guideline for preservation planning is the latest in a series of nestor publications. nestor is the German competence network for digital preservation and it offers all interested parties from the private and public domains the possibility to participate in working groups. The guideline for preservation planning is the result of such a working group, which discussed the conceptual and practical issues of implementing the OAIS Functional Entity Preservation Planning"". The guideline describes a process model and offers some guidance on potential implementations. It integrates and builds on recognized community concepts like Significant Properties, the OAIS Designated Community, the National Archives of Australia's Performance Model, the PREMIS concept of Intellectual Entities and Representations, and the PLANET's approach to preservation planning. Furthermore, it introduces the concepts ""intended use"" (Nutzungsziele), ""information type"" (Informationstyp) and ""preservation group"" (Erhaltungsgruppe). The purpose of these new categories is that information objects shall be grouped by information type (e.g., audio, video, text...) and intended use (e.g., reading for pleasure, search for specific information...) to preservation groups for automatic processing. Significant properties can then be derived for whole preservation groups. The file format alone is considered as not completely sufficient for such categorisation. Some exemplary implementation solutions of the new concepts are presented in an annex. The guideline takes into account that resources for preservation planning and preservation actions are limited and has therefore adopted 4 premises: adequacy, financial viability, automation, and authenticity of archived objects. Its pragmatic approach becomes apparent in the definition and explanation of these dimensions. The guideline is written from the point of view of representatives of memory institutions, i.e., libraries, archives, museums, and is primarily targeted at this context although it may be useful for other information preserving institutions too. This contribution introduces the nestor guideline for preservation planning (for now only available in German; English translation envisaged for 1st half of 2014) to an international audience for the first time. It also matches the process model and the new concepts intended use, information type and preservation group to the collection and preservation reality of the German National Library."""
S. T. Kowalczyk,2014,Where does all the data go: Quantifying the final disposition of research data,"This paper describes the results of a large survey designed to quantify the final disposition of research data and to determine the extent that the key factors of repository technologies and data management resources influence the decisions that researchers make about their data. A total of 724 National Science Foundation awardees completed this survey. Removable media devices such as CDs, DVDs, and removable hard drives are the most common storage technologies. Less than 30% of researchers use community or reference repositories. More than half of the researchers get storage through their institutions. Institutional support for storage is significantly higher than for data management. The key finding of this research is that the availability of resources is the most significant indicator of whether the final deposition of data is in a preservationworthy manner. Resources, provided by the research institution or via grant funding, include storage technologies, repository systems, and data management personnel. When high quality data storage is offered, researchers will use it. When professional data managers are available, data is more likely to be stored in more sustainable technologies.

S. Wan; Q. Cao; C. Xie,2014,Optical storage: An emerging option in long-term digital preservation,"Long-term digital preservation is an important issue in data storage area. For years, magnetic media based solutions, such as tape and hard disk drive (HDD) based archive systems, monopolize the data archiving market due to their high capacity and low cost. However, in the era of big data, rapidly increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data set bring numerous challenges to the archive systems in various aspects, such as capacity, cost, performance, reliability, power consumption, and so on. In recent years, high capacity optical media, such as bluray discs (BDs) and holographic discs, emerge with the revival of optical storage. Due to the natural simple construction of the optical media, the archive systems based on those optical media, e.g., BD library, demonstrate attractive properties, such as cost per bit, reliability, power consumption, and so on, thus become feasible options in long-term digital preservation. In this paper, we reviewed and compared both the magnetic and optical media based solutions for long-term digital preservation, followed by a summarization on techniques to improve the optical media based archive system. © 2014, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The digital library has been collecting materials coming from different kind of organizations including departments, libraries, and archives, belonging or donated to Sapienza University. The main result of the project was the development of an information framework supporting multidisciplinary organizations in managing digital materials, maintaining scientific, organizational and operational responsibilities. The technical solution adopted has found a tradeoff between the standardization of the digital processes and products, and the preservation of the scientific materials' peculiarities. The automatic standard translation, and the enrichment of the digital resource's metadata have reached the main goal of providing digital resources with the essential information necessary to their management in different technological contexts. The reuse of the digital information and contents, in different application contexts, has converted the holistic vision of a digital library in the implementation of an information infrastructure, setting the foundation for the long-term access and usability of its digital assets. © 2014 The Authors.

T. P. Swanson,2014,"PREMIS-Lite, a preservation metadata generator","Digital preservation is without question an important, if not essential, facet of our now digital society. Implementing a digital preservation strategy is crucial to ensuring the longevity and sustained usability of digital content. The importance of digital preservation is not limited to large-scale institutions and organizations, but also extends to private individuals and small-scale businesses. PREMIS is currently the international preservation metadata standard. The objective of PREMIS was to identify and create a wide ranging and implementable set of core"" preservation metadata elements while following the recommendations of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) reference model. However, the depth and complexity of that coverage can be confusing and discourage its potential use. Using the PREMIS standard as a model this project creates a ""PREMIS-Lite"" xml preservation metadata generator. This PREMIS-Lite XML generator and its supporting PREMIS-Lite semantic unit definition, user guide, and crosswalk combine to allow for the simple capture and creation of preservation metadata at the object level."""

V. Johnson; S. Ranade; D.

Design/methodology/approach – Though data loss and format obsolescence are often considered to be the major threats to digital records, the problem of scale remains under-acknowledged. This paper discusses this issue, and the challenges it brings using a case study of a set of Second World War service records. Findings – TNA’s research has shown that it is possible to digitise large volumes of records to replace paper originals using rigorous procedures. Consequent benefits included being able to link across large data sets so that further records could be released. Practical implications – The authors will discuss whether the technical capability, plus space and cost savings will result in increased pressure to retain, and what this means in creating a feedback-loop of volume. Social implications – The work also has implications in terms of new definitions of the “original” archival record. There has been much debate on challenges to the definition of the archival record in the shift from paper to born-digital. The authors will discuss where this leaves the digitised “original” record. Originality/value – Large volumes of digitised and born-digital records are starting to arrive in records and archive stores, and the implications for retention are far wider than simply digital preservation. By sharing novel research into the practical implications of large-scale data retention, this paper showcases potential issues and some approaches to their management. © 2014, © Government agency."

To date, the process of analyzing a collection-from data gathering to exploratory analysis and final conclusions-has largely been conducted using linear review and pen and paper methods. To help curators analyze large-scale digital collections, we developed an interactive visual analytics application. We have put methods in place to summarize large and diverse information about the collection and to present it as integrated views. Multiple views can be linked or unlinked on demand to enable curators to identify trends and particularities at different levels of detail and to compare and contrast views. We describe two analysis workflows to illustrate how the application can be used to triage digital collections and facilitate collection management decision making and to provide access.

X. Zhao; S. Lindley,2014,Curation through use: Understanding the personal value of social media,"Content generation on social network sites has been considered mainly from the perspective of individuals interacting with social network contacts. Yet research has also pointed to the potential for social media to become a meaningful personal archive over time. The aim of this paper is to consider how social media, over time and across sites, forms part of the wider digital archiving space for individuals. Our findings, from a qualitative study of 14 social media users, highlight how although some sites are more associated with 'keepable' social media than others, even those are not seen as archives in the usual sense of the word. We show how this perception is bound up with five contradictions, which center on social media as curated, as a reliable repository of meaningful content, as readily encountered and as having the potential to present content as a compelling narrative. We conclude by highlighting opportunities for design relating to curation through use and what this implies for personal digital archives, which are known to present difficulties in terms of curation and re-finding."

Y. Liu,2014,Electronic records preservation in China – An exploratory inquiry,"Electronic records in China are defined as records that are created by digital devices and in a digital environment, exist in digital formats, rely on digital devices such as computers for reading and processing, and can be transmitted via communication networks. As a subset of electronic records, archival electronic records are those, based on their reference and use values, determined as needing to be preserved as archives. A gap was identified by reviewing literature that, although there are projects being conducted in a number of archival institutions, a systematic and standardized approach towards archival preservation of electronic records is currently lacking in China. In order to lay the foundation on which such an approach can be built, the present study was conceived to gain a comprehensive understanding of the preservation of archival electronic records in both the provincial and secondary provincial archives throughout the country. Relying on survey methodology and the OAIS reference model as the guiding theoretical framework, the study collected and analyzed data from a large number of archival institutions in China. As the first of its kind conducted in the geographical area of the Mainland China in terms of scope and subject matter, the investigation yielded empirical discoveries that over half of investigated archives had ingested electronic records with non-uniform and insufficient long-term preservation mechanisms. The study also pointed out that the issues surrounding electronic records management in records creating agencies were considered most challenging for long-term preservation, and that a national strategy with a top-down approach was called for, which could take full advantage of the Chinese archival system. It is believed that the findings generated by this study will be instructive and beneficial to the other types of archives in China and to the archival functions that operate internationally in similar or comparable environments. © The Author(s) 2013."

Mezaris,2015,Investigating human behaviors in selecting personal photos to preserve memories,"Photos are excellent means for keeping and refreshing memories. Digital photography, however, imposes new challenges for keeping photos accessible on the long run due to threats such as hard disk crashes, format changes, or storage medium decay. Safe long-term preservation, ensuring the longevity of photos, comes at a cost, suggesting a restriction of this investment to the most valuable photos. Therefore, understanding how people behave when selecting their most valuable photos from large collections is an important first step towards the development of automatic preservation approaches. In this paper, we conduct a user study of 35 participants in selecting personal photos for long-term preservation. The results of the study provide insights for the photo selection process. In addition, we propose a photo selection method based on machine learning and compared human selections with leading edge clustering techniques, highlighting significant issues in emulating human decision patterns. © 2015 IEEE."

A. Fresa; B. Justrell; C. Prandoni,2015,Digital curation and quality standards for memory institutions: PREFORMA research project,"Memory institutions are facing increasing transfers of electronic documents and other media content for long-term preservation. Preservation models are often inspired by standards, such as the Open Archival Information System reference model, where transfers and preservation are built on information packages containing both data and metadata. Data are normally stored in specific file formats for documents, images, sound, video, etc., that are produced by software from different vendors. Even if the transferred files are in standard formats, the implementation of standards cannot be guaranteed and results may be different depending on the software used. The software implementing standards for the production of the electronic files are not controlled either by the institutions that produce them or by the memory institutions. Conformance tests of transfers are done, but their results cannot be further processed by the memory institution autonomously, unless it contacts the same provider of the conformance test again. This poses problems in curation and preservation. Data objects meant for preservation, passing through an uncontrolled generative process, can jeopardise the whole preservation exercise. The overall intention of PREFORMA project (PREservation FORMAts for culture information/e-archives) is to research critical factors in the quality of standard implementation in order to establish a long-term sustainable ecosystem around a range of practical tools, together with a variety of stakeholder groups. The tools should be innovative and provide a reference implementation of the most common file format standards for the assessment of the collections to be archived and for the correction of the digital archive. PREFORMA will target a wide digital curation and preservation community, by providing specifications and feedback to developers, standard bodies and memory institutions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
A. Goethals; F. Frey; D. Ackerman,2015,The evolving process to add preservation support for new formats at Harvard library,"In 2000 Harvard Library began populating the Digital Repository Service (DRS), its digital preservation repository, with digitized text, images and audio. Over the years the Library continued to add preservation support to the DRS for new formats including born digital websites, PDF documents and email. Library collections however continued to grow and diversify to include a wide range of formats not supported by the DRS, including video and a variety of born-digital formats. In 2013 the Library began to bridge that preservation support gap by refining the process of how new formats are supported in the DRS. This paper describes the new process, which is a more consistent workflow and includes external expertise; as well as analysis tools that could be used by other institutions to broaden the range of digital formats that they are able to preserve.. © 2015 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

A. H. Poole,2015,How has your science data grown? Digital curation and the human factor: a critical literature review,"Focusing on North America and the United Kingdom, this critical literature review underscores the ways in which sharing, accessing, and reusing science data allow researchers and other stakeholders to address new imperatives in scientific research. Science data stakeholders should harness the principles and practices of digital curation, an overarching concept that encompasses data curation and that centers on adding value to digital data assets. This review first probes data sharing, access, and reuse in specific intellectual and institutional contexts. Next, it examines the ways in which science data sharing, access, and reuse benefits scholarship, primarily by encouraging new research questions and by allowing the reproduction of previous findings. Third, it addresses the infrastructure of science data curation, particularly the roles of cyberinfrastructure, research communities, collaboration, planning, policy, and standards and best practices. Fourth, it turns to the role of institutions—archives, research libraries, institutional repositories, and centers—in curating science data. Archival principles such as provenance, selection and appraisal, authenticity, metadata, risk management, and trust play a pivotal role in digital curation. Finally, it delineates avenues for further research such as sustainability, costing, planning and policy, training and education, researcher practices, and raising awareness. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."
A. J. Nelson; A. D.

Owing to the importance of non-destructive analyses to the study of mummified human remains, the IMPACT database, website, and wiki provide a basis for anthropological and palaeopathological investigations, grounded in the most current technological imaging and communication standards, accessible through any internet connection, and protected against rapidly changing media standards. Composed of paired online radiographic and contextual databases, the IMPACT project is intended to provide researchers with large-scale primary data samples for anthropological and palaeopathological investigations. IMPACT addresses the limitations of the case-study approach to mummified human remains and contributes to the development of standards of practice in imaging of mummified remains. Furthermore, IMPACT allows researchers a greater appreciation of, and engagement with, patterns of health and disease in ancient times as well as the variability present in the mummification traditions of ancient Egypt and other cultures that sought to preserve their dead for eternity.

A. Jääskeläinen,2015,Realizing the potentiality of metrics in digital preservation,"Metrics that are collected by utilizing different methods are the key factors in understanding what is happening under the hood. Currently, the field of digital archiving relies heavily on SLAs (Service Level Agreement) and technical level metrics. While technical metrics are superior in collecting the hard evidence behind any operational unit, it doesn't take account any of the metrics that are relevant when considering the softer side of any technological device, service or software. From the authors' opinion, technical metrics describe merely 1/5 of the whole truth. User and context related metrics aren't utilized and still these have been recognized to be the keys to success in many other fields, in fact these softer metrics are sometimes recognized as a KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). This paper proposes the utilization of the well-known methodologies also in the field of digital archiving in order to gain a good overlook of what is happening behind the scenes.. © 2015 Society for Imaging Science and Technology."
A. Jansen,2015,Using archival diplomatics and object-oriented programming to build preservation objects in the Cloud,"The use of Cloud Service Providers to store and manage records has introduced a new challenge to establishing the authenticity of digital records. Not only are these records removed from their systems of creation, but they are then placed into a dynamic, co-tenancy environment that can span both technological and geographic boundaries. To overcome the challenges these changes present to determining the authenticity of records in the Cloud, the author is proposing the creation of preservation model objects that leverage Archival Diplomatics concepts within the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm that is utilized by most modern programming languages. By basing the creation of digital records stored within Cloud-based systems on an Archival Diplomatics based view of authentic digital records, such as the extensive research by InterPARES, the preservation objects will possess sufficient evidence to support their presumption of authenticity regardless of movement across time and space. © 2015 IEEE."

Provenance captures a derivation history of data products and is essential to the long-term preservation, to reuse, and to determine data quality. We propose the provenance catalogue that took into account NFR patterns and provenance taxonomies and specifications to define its softgoals. This work depicts a novel approach on provenance describing it as a Softgoal Interdependency Graph, a reusable framework that makes explicit characterization, decomposition, relationships and operationalization of elements that can be satisfied with the software.

The author is well aware of the fact that he lacks the necessary tools to answer these similarly-worded questions. Instead, he offers a set of considerations based on a non-academic context as a film archivist. To summarize: the author openly describes his reaction to the rapid expansion of digital cinema and the need to find a proper place for it in such emerging context. The author further emphasizes the positive impact of this revolution particularly in terms of availability and immeasurably more detailed knowledge of the legacy of the past, Furthermore, he asserts that massive digitization of more than a hundred years of film history in the coming years is highly improbable and admits the quandary of the effectiveness and reliability of digital media as instruments of the long-term preservation of audiovisual heritage. The author then gives several reasons to maintain the utmost attention to cinema on film, and finally outlines a scenario of formation of networks of “scattered islands of analogue vision”. © 2015, National Film Archive.

A. Osswald,2015,Skills for the future: Educational opportunities for digital curation professionals,"Several cultural heritage institutions all around the world have set up special services, trainings, courses or programs focusing on curation of digital material. Digital curation is a multifaceted task with a great variety of responsibilities, preconditions and objectives. For the first time in this field the DigCurV project offers a framework to locate competences and skills related to vocational education and training regarding digital curation processes. Referring to this framework should be a good starting point for differentiated educational activities focusing on special target groups, their educational background, the objectives of the digital curation process, and the material which has to be curated. Based on this, additional frameworks comprising these educational activities can be set up - still referring to the DigCurV framework partially or in total. This will offer the opportunity to compare educational activities regarding content and the results achieved. Beside these efforts regarding content and concepts of digital curation education there is another ongoing challenge: getting people involved and making them eager to curate (their) digital material properly. The curation job is hardly glamorous or much admired. For the most part it is a service-oriented back office activity demanding functionality and perfection. For a long time, specialists will be needed - and will need qualified training - to meet these requirements. Increasing awareness of the need for digital curation by professionals and the public offers opportunities to get digital curation professionals and their skills involved even in everyone's working environment."

A. Sabharwal,2015,Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities: Preserving and Promoting Archival and Special Collections,"Archives and special collections departments have a long history of preserving and providing long-term access to organizational records, rare books, and other unique primary sources including manuscripts, photographs, recordings, and artifacts in various formats. The careful curatorial attention to such records has also ensured that such records remain available to researchers and the public as sources of knowledge, memory, and identity. Digital curation presents an important framework for the continued preservation of digitized and born-digital collections, given the ephemeral and device-dependent nature of digital content. With the emergence of analog and digital media formats in close succession (compared to earlier paper- and film-based formats) came new standards, technologies, methods, documentation, and workflows to ensure safe storage and access to content and associated metadata. Researchers in the digital humanities have extensively applied computing to research; for them, continued access to primary data and cultural heritage means both the continuation of humanities scholarship and new methodologies not possible without digital technology. Digital Curation in the Digital Humanities, therefore, comprises a joint framework for preserving, promoting, and accessing digital collections. This book explores at great length the conceptualization of digital curation projects with interdisciplinary approaches that combine the digital humanities and history, information architecture, social networking, and other themes for such a framework. The individual chapters focus on the specifics of each area, but the relationships holding the knowledge architecture and the digital curation lifecycle model together remain an overarching theme throughout the book; thus, each chapter connects to others on a conceptual, theoretical, or practical level. • theoretical and practical perspectives on digital curation in the digital humanities and history • in-depth study of the role of social media and a social curation ecosystem • the role of hypertextuality and information architecture in digital curation • study of collaboration and organizational dimensions in digital curation • reviews of important web tools in digital humanities. © 2015 A.

Baturin,2015,Laser scanning and 3D modeling of the Shukhov hyperboloid tower in Moscow,"The Shabolovka radio tower in Moscow, also known as the Shukhov tower, is a famous example of the Russian avant-garde style of the early 20th century. With a height of approximately 160. m, it is the highest hyperboloid lattice steel tower ever built by Shukhov and is one of the symbols of Moscow. It is widely recognized as an artifact of modern cultural heritage. Despite being an iconic object of engineering and architectural heritage, it was deprived of technical maintenance for many years. Its technical condition has degraded since the early 1990s and has now reached an alarming level. Several restoration projects are still being discussed by the Russian government, including the full rebuilding of the tower in another place. Therefore, digital preservation of the tower's original geometry and design has become a crucial task. Its under-documentation is also a concern: the initial project and engineering documentation is almost completely lost. To preserve information about the tower, we performed laser scanning and created a precise polygonal 3D model using both the results of the scanning and the existing drawings. The transition from an unstructured point cloud to a highly structured representation included the development of a special methodology to model deformed steel elements of hyperboloid sections. The tower was scanned from seven viewpoints, resulting in a 65. M point cloud. To reproduce the individual shapes of twisted rods and rings, we used > 4. K pre-defined cross-sections. These were precisely positioned in a point cloud. The connection joints of steel elements were modeled using drawings based on measurements that were made in 1947. Non-original design elements such as service platforms and an elevator were also modeled using the point cloud. We also made use of historical drawings and photographs to represent the internal structure of the concrete basement and the non-extant original superstructure. The combination of various methods of 3D modeling for different parts of the tower allowed us to visualize the geometry of the huge steel construction with high accuracy (1. cm or so) and with high level of detail in a reasonable timeframe (300man-days). Public access to large 3D models and to vast amounts of raw data is a sensitive issue for virtual heritage applications. To provide free access to our results, we created an open-source software application based on Open Scene Graph. It supports stereo visualization of the point cloud and the 3D model, as well as management of the visibility of different layers of the model in accordance with its lifecycle period. A light web-version based on Unity 3D is also being developed to provide Internet access to the model. The software is freely available at our website (http://virtual.ihst.ru/shukhov-tower.html). Thus, we created a comprehensive visual representation of a steel lattice radio tower of the early 20th century and shared precise technical documentation with researchers worldwide. The experience that we have gained can be useful for other similar projects that involve precise polygonal modeling of large-scale objects of modern cultural heritage. © 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS."

When we come to the issue of long-term preservation of such RDF-based digital objects, it is important to provide full support for reusing them in the future. In particular, it should include means for both players who have no familiarity with RDF data model and, at the same time, who by working only with the native format of the data still provide sufficient information. To achieve this, we need mechanisms to bring the data back to their original format and structure.New informationIn this paper, we investigate how to perform the reverse process for column-based data sources. In particular, we devise an algorithm, RML2CSV, and exemplify its implementation in transforming an RDF dataset into its CSV tabular structure, through the use of the same RML mapping document that was used to generate the set of RDF triples. Through a set of content-based criteria, we attempt a comparative evaluation to measure the similarity between the rebuilt CSV and the original one. The results are promising and show that, under certain assumptions, RML2CSV reconstructs the same data with the same structure, offering more advanced digital preservation services."

C. Coutinho; R. Costa; R. Jardim-Gonçalves,2015,Modelling services for business knowledge capture,"The competition inherent to globalisation has led enterprises to gather in nests of specialised business providers with the purpose of building better applications and provide more complete solutions. This, added to the improvements on the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), led to a paradigm shift from product-centrism to service-centrism and to the need to communicate and interoperate. Traditional segments like banking, insurance and aerospace subcontract a large number of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that are undergoing this change, and must ensure the criticality and accuracy of their business is not affected or impacted in any way. This also is an excellent motivation for improving the capabilities for capturing the knowledge about businesses, not only their processes and methods but also their surrounding environment. The EU co-funded FP7 TIMBUS project comprises tools and techniques to improve business continuity featuring an intelligent strategy for digital preservation of business assets and environments based on risk-management. This paper proposes the modelling of service-based business information capturing strategies to help in the proper establishment of a knowledge base that permits a seamless interoperability between enterprises.

C. Dallas,2015,Curating archaeological knowledge in the digital continuum: From practice to infrastructure,"As a grand challenge"" for digital archaeology, I propose the adoption of programmatic research to meet the challenges of archaeological curation in the digital continuum, contingent on curation-enabled global digital infrastructures, and on contested regimes of archaeological knowledge production and meaning making. My motivation stems from an interest in the sociotechnical practices of archaeology, viewed as purposeful activities centred on material traces of past human presence. This is exemplified in contemporary practices of interpretation ""at the trowel's edge"", in epistemological reflexivity and in pluralization of archaeological knowledge. Adopting a practice-centred approach, I examine how the archaeological record is constructed and curated through archaeological activity ""from the field to the screen"" in a variety of archaeological situations. I call attention to Çatalhöyük as a salient case study illustrating the ubiquity of digital curation practices in experimental, well-resourced and purposefully theorized archaeological fieldwork, and I propose a conceptualization of digital curation as a pervasive, epistemic-pragmatic activity extending across the lifecycle of archaeological work. To address these challenges, I introduce a medium-term research agenda that speaks both to epistemic questions of theory in archaeology and information science, and to pragmatic concerns of digital curation, its methods, and application in archaeology. The agenda I propose calls for multidisciplinary, multi-team, multiyear research of a programmatic nature, aiming to re-examine archaeological ontology, to conduct focused research on pervasive archaeological research practices and methods, and to design and develop curation functionalities coupled with existing pervasive digital infrastructures used by archaeologists. It has a potential value in helping to establish an epistemologically coherent framework for the interdisciplinary field of archaeological curation, in aligning archaeological ontologies work with practice-based, agencyoriented and participatory theorizations of material culture, and in matching the specification and design of archaeological digital infrastructures with the increasingly globalized, ubiquitous and pervasive digital information environment and the multiple contexts of contemporary meaning-making in archaeology. © 2015 Costis Dallas licensee De Gruyter Open."""

Pollock,2015,Long-term Preservation of Data Analysis Capabilities,"While the long-term preservation of scientific data obtained by large astrophysics missions is ensured through science archives, the issue of data analysis software preservation has hardly been addressed. Efforts by large data centres have contributed so far to maintain some instrument or mission-specific data reduction packages on top of high-level general purpose data analysis software. However, it is always difficult to keep software alive without support and maintenance once the active phase of a mission is over. This is especially difficult in the budgetary model followed by space agencies. We discuss the importance of extending the lifetime of dedicated data analysis packages and review diverse strategies under development at ESA using new paradigms such as Virtual Machines, Cloud Computing, and Software as a Service for making possible full availability of data analysis and calibration software for decades at minimal cost."

An exploratory study of DANS,"Despite the advances in policy and practice for data sharing, surprisingly little is known about the uses and users of digital data archives, about relationships between users and the staff of data archives, or how these behaviors vary by discipline, geographic region, policy, and other factors. Digital data archives are not a single type of institution, however. They vary widely in organizational structure, mission, collection, funding, and relationships to their users and other stakeholders. We present an exploratory study of DANS, the Digital Archiving and Networked Services of the Netherlands, with the goal of identifying methods for studying the contributors, consumers, and role of archivists in digital data archives. Starting with transaction logs that serve management purposes, we present estimates of the distribution of uses and users of DANS. Units of analysis necessary to study user behavior, such as dataset, file, user, creator, and consumer, are difficult to glean from logs that were not designed for these inquiries. We recommend methods for improving the design of data collection instruments and outline the subsequent phases of our mixed-method research on the uses, users, policy, and practice of digital data archiving. © 2015 Christine L.

Medeiros,2015,Investigating social curation websites: A crowd computing perspective,"This paper analyzes five social curation tools, chosen for having a relevant number of users and for being subject of other academic studies. Based on existing literature, the concepts of curation, digital curation, and social curation are discussed. Three main research questions are the objective of the research: how 'social' are the studied tools, if they are adequate to crowd work, and how good they are as search engines. It is concluded that in the current state of affairs, these tools are quite social as social media sites, but little social as social curation sites; that they are not adequate to crowd work. It is observed, however, that these tools use the wisdom of the crowds to filter the vast web content, and that they may be seen as crowd computing tools. © 2015 IEEE."

In order to be able to play them, decoders are needed, which, however, as any kind of software are architecture-specific and can potentially not be executed on future hardware. To overcome this issue, we propose a multilevel approach that combines serialization standardization and model-based specification of video data. Both are architecture-independent and serve as a basis for the implementation of decoders on specific (future) hardware with a standardized access interface. This interoperability aspect simplifies the integration of video decoding capabilities on different architectures and the cooperative work on video data content. © 2015 IEEE."

D. Grant; C. Debruyne; R. Grant; S. Collins,2015,Creating and consuming metadata from transcribed historical vital records for ingestion in a long-term digital preservation platform,"In the Irish Record Linkage 1864-1913 (IRL) project, digital archivists transcribe digitized register pages containing vital records into a database, which is then used to generate RDF triples. Historians then use those triples to answer some specific research questions on the IRL platform. Though the triples themselves are a highly valuable asset that can be adopted by many, the digitized records and their RDF representations need to be adequately stored and preserved according to best standards and guidelines to ensure those do not get lost over time. This was a problem currently not investigated within this project. This paper reports on the creation of Qualified Dublin Core from those triples for ingestion with the digitized register pages in an adequate long-term digital preservation platform and repository. Rather than creating RDF only for the purpose of this project, we demonstrate how we can distill artifacts from the RDF that is fit for discovery, access, and even reuse via that repository and how we elicit and conserve the knowledge and memories about Ireland, its history and culture contained in those register pages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015."

The LOCKSS Program runs the Red Hat"" model of free, open source software and paid support. From 2007 through 2012 the program was in the black with no grant funds at all. The demands of the ""Red Hat"" model make it hard to devote development resources to enhancements that don't address immediate user demands but are targeted at longer-term issues. After discussing this issue with the Mellon Foundation, the LOCKSS Program was awarded a grant to cover a specific set of infrastructure enhancements. It made significant functional and performance improvements to the LOCKSS software in the areas of ingest, preservation and dissemination.

Natural and human activities endanger the current state of monuments and sites, whereas many of them have already been destroyed especially during the last years. Preventive actions are of utmost importance for the protection of human memory and the prevention of irreplaceable. These actions may be carried out either in situ or virtually. Very often in situ preventive, or protective or restoration actions are difficult or even impossible, as e.g. in cases of earthquakes, fires or war activity. Digital preservation of cultural heritage is a challenging task within photogrammetry and computer vision communities, as efforts are taken to collect digital data, especially of the monuments that are at high risk. Visit to the field and data acquisition is not always feasible. To overcome the missing data problem, crowdsourced imagery is used to create a visual representation of lost cultural heritage objects. Such digital representations may be 2D or 3D and definitely help preserve the memory and history of the lost heritage. Sometimes they also assist studies for their reconstruction. An initiative to collect imagery data from the public and create a visual 3D representation of a recently destroyed stone bridge almost 150 years old is being discussed in this study. To this end, a crowdsourcing platform has been designed and the first images collected have been processed with the use of SfM algorithms."

The course is intended to overcome the insecurity and perceived lack of knowledge about data management which prevents library staff from proactively providing support to research staff with the management, storage and sharing of their research data. The course objectives are: 1) to transfer and exchange knowledge about data management, and 2) to provide participants with the skills required to advise researchers or research groups on efficient and effective ways of adding value to their data. The course is an additional service provided by 3TU.Datacentrum44 a digital repository for research data set up by the research libraries of the three Dutch Universities of Technology (3TU): Delft University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology, and the University of Twente. The paper describes the process of creating the course, the methodology, and the results of the two courses in 2012. There were three phases to creating the course: 1) an investigation of the training needs, 2) the design of the course and 3) the development of the training materials. The training needs could be divided into hard skills (such as data management basics, data citation and knowledge of the data browser interface) and soft skills (such as acquisition skills, advisory skills and a reflective attitude towards their profession). This has led to a course with a competency-based modular design, consisting of four modules. The project team consisted of 3TU.Datacentrum staff. The team designed a blended learning course, composed of a didactical mix of group meetings, online study and homework assignments, including the website Data Intelligence45 that provides online reference material. By using a modern collaboration environment and social media, the course meets the needs of the modern scientific community. The training methodology proved effective in creating a solid base for digital preservation and a network of starting data librarians. In the first half of 2012, 14 librarians participated in the pilot course and provided feedback. The feedback has been used to improve the next cycle of the course, which started in September 2012. In February 2013 the third cycle starts. This paper demonstrates the choices made during the design process. Finally, future plans are discussed. They include expanding the course to make the materials also suitable to researchers and other data repositories in cooperation with organisations from The Netherlands."

Picariello,2015,Multimedia data integration and processing for E-government,"Knowledge management has become a challenge for almost all E-government based applications where one of the main problem is the efficient management of great amounts of data. In order to efficiently access the information embedded in very large document repositories, techniques for semantic document management are required. They ensure improvement for a large and intense process of dematerialization and aim at eliminating or at least reducing, the amount of paper documents. In this work, we present a novel model of digital documents for the improvement of the dematerialization effectiveness. This model represents the starting point for an information system that is able to manage the document streams in an efficient way. It takes into account E-government applications needs like the compliance with the laws and regulations in force and the adaptability to evolving technologies. At the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is one of the first attempts to give a single and unified characterization for the management of multimedia documents, pertaining to a bureaucratic domain as the E-government one, on which semantic procedures are used for the transformation of non structured documents (pertaining to specialized domain) into structured data, suitable for automatic processing. Furthermore, an architecture for the management of documents life cycle is proposed, which provides advanced functionalities for semantic processing, such as giving formal structure to document informative content, information extraction, semantic retrieval, indexing, storage, presentation, together with long-term preservation."

The most significant modern literary archive is that of premier poetry publishers Carcanet Press, whose correspondence is now largely digital in nature. The Library's Carcanet Press E-mail Preservation Project (2012–14) addressed the urgent need to acquire and safeguard this internationally significant digital archive for the future. The project resulted in the successful rescue and preservation of 215,000 e-mails and 65,000 attachments generated by Carcanet Press. It has also ensured that the Library is equipped to deal with regular accruals to the archive in the future. The project's work was recognized in 2014, when it received the Digital Preservation Coalition's prestigious biennial award for “Safeguarding the Digital Legacy.” This case study explores some of the challenges and opportunities involved in acquiring and preserving e-mail archives such as this one, addressing issues of acquisition, appraisal, format migration, authenticity, access—via traditional finding aids and newer technologies such as data visualization—and use.

Archeologists and museum experts have commonly used 2D digital pictures to preserve and study artifacts. Recently, these scholars have also started to use 3D digital archives for their studies. Yet, we still need to determine how these two formats (2D vs. 3D) affect the perception of our past. Results of our experiments point to 3D digital replicas of artifacts as more effective means to digitally preserve tangible cultural heritage, since 3D multi-visualization augments the perception of physical characteristics of the artifacts allowing a more embodied experience with these objects. Our experiments also suggest that multi-visualization (i.e., point-cloud, mesh, and color information) helps the viewers to overcome their personal conceptualization of specific objects. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

Design/methodology/approach – An investigation was deployed to attendants in 20 training courses created by the National Archives Administration (NAA) in Taiwan for records staff on the topic of digital preservation. The responses were collected from respondents who were participating in an online community for archive management. Through structural equation modeling method, this study examined the effects of channel richness, information transparency and accessibility of archive to brand image and trust and then continued to the satisfaction of professional participants to archive management in an online community. Findings – Appropriate disclosure of information regarding archiving can effectively improve the satisfaction of participants in the online community to archive. Channel richness of communication, information transparency and accessibility of archive significantly affect the brand image of archive and the trust of participants to archivists and finally affect the satisfaction of participants in the online community towards archive management. Practical implications – The larger the amount of information exchanged, the more the trust among participants and the better brand image of the archives. The more trust and brand image exists among participants, the more satisfaction they will obtain from archive management. Originality/value – The results can provide a strategic direction for managers of the national archive and the online community in government agencies to allocate resources for enhancing the information richness and the image of archive as well as achieving the satisfaction of participants in the professional community. © ."

One of the main challenges in maintaining digital libraries is the digital preservation aspect. The aim of digital preservation is to ensure that digital records are filed and are made available throughout time. Each digital library consists of different documents with different file formats. Due to rapid obsolescence in hardware and software technology it is necessary for the libraries to look into the details of the file formats. Thus the file format for long-term preservation plays a very important role during the practices of digital preservation. The article tries to analyzing the current situation of the file formats, then points out the standards in choosing the file format for long-term preservation based on generalizing the researches by scholars.

Specifically, in the artistic domain, this framework is targeting production processes involving work-specific digital technologies, where the goal is to preserve the ways of re-performing the works rather than the preservation of a recording of the performance. This framework is based on four previous studies and their ontological and epistemological assumptions.

Despite their best efforts, it is difficult to save manuscripts in physical form beyond a time frame. Digital preservation of manuscripts restores it from damage, larceny and decay. Need of digitization of manuscript, digitization initiatives in India, benefits and threats of digital preservation, process of digitization and guiding principles are the key issues discussed in this paper. The paper also discusses manuscripts and rare literature at Panjab University, Chandigarh and digitization projects at Punjab level. © 2015 IEEE."
H. L. Moulaison; A. J. Million,2015,E-publishing in libraries: The [digital] preservation imperative,"Purpose – This paper aims to, through an analysis of the current literature, explore the current state of the library e-publishing community and its approach to preservation. Libraries are increasingly proposing publishing services as part of their work with their communities, and recently, there has been a pronounced interest in providing electronic publishing (e-publishing) services. The library e-publishing community, however, has not systematically studied the need for the long-term preservation of the digital content they help create. Design/methodology/approach – Through a reflective analysis of the literature, this paper explores the context and the evolution of e-publishing as a trend that aligns with public library missions; in doing so, it also explores implications for digital preservation in the context of these new services and identifies gaps in the literature. Findings – Digital preservation is an important and worthwhile activity for library e-publishers; preservation of community-based author content cannot, however, be an afterthought and should be planned from the beginning. Future study should take into consideration the needs and expectations of community-based authors. Existing digital preservation guidelines also provide a point of reference for the community and researchers. Originality/value – This paper addresses the understudied area of the importance of digital preservation to library e-publishing. In doing so, it also investigates the role of the library in supporting community-based authors when e-publishing through the library. © "

H. M. dos Santos; D. Flores,2015,Trusted digital repositories for digital archival documents: Considerations on the preservation in long-term,"The evolution of information technology and its insertion in the Archival science provided breaks in the concept and design of archival document that are reflected in practices of management, preservation and access. The complexity and specificity of the digital archival document implies the need for different treatment compared to traditional documents on analog media. In addition, we must ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital documents by storing them in a trusted system. In this sense, digital repositories are configured globally as the best alternative to preserve in long-term, however, the actions to generate trustworthy are poorly distributed. This article aims to make a reflection on the requirements for developing a trusted digital repository. The methodology used is to review of materials previously published in the last twenty years, which approaches the data qualitatively, emphasizing the most recent studies. Among the most significant advances, highlight the audits for the repositories can be certified as “trusted”. Furthermore, is enhanced the use of standards and recommendations, and the prior definition of digital preservation policies that consider the trustworthy throughout the documentary cycle, thus creating a trust custody. © 2015, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

I. Anderson; R. Lancia,2015,Digital curation in architecture curricula and vocational training for architects. The DEDICATE framework in architectural CAD courses design,"As the design processes in architectural practices switch toward entirely digital workflows, architects are gradually required, because of their legal and commercial liability, to provide for both a relatively long-term curation of their own digital products and the deposit of authoritative data. But, despite being the sole curation actors for their data, architects receive little education or training in either pertinent competences nor agreed and established procedures to comply with these duties. In this paper, the DEDICATE project, an AHRC funded project hosted by the HATII of the University of Glasgow, will be discussed to explain its role in the design of Digital Curation courses within architectural CAD education and architects' vocational training."

Mearns,2015,From broadcasting to archiving: the Southern African public service broadcast archives,"Public Service Broadcasters have an obligation to manage their records as public organisations. This is often legislated and public broadcasters therefore have to protect collections from physical deterioration and damage to minimise the loss of information. Public Service Broadcasters should thus be informed and up to date with preservation strategies to ensure the safeguarding of their collections. This study investigated the current status of the Southern African Broadcasting Association member Public Service Broadcasting archives collections and their digitisation strategies to ensure long-term preservation of collections. While many aspects of preservation status were investigated, this article focuses on the formats held within each collection, playback equipment available in archives, cataloguing practices to provide access to the collections and the digitisation initiatives undertaken by the broadcaster. Findings showed that decisive action for long-term preservation is needed to mitigate the risk of large portions of the study sample collections being lost for ever. © 2015 Archives and Records Association."

There is a plethora of models, standards and best practices addressing the different facets for the preservation of digital objects. The management of digital objects requires well-defined policies and data management plans that include all processes within their specific lifecycle. To achieve high levels of data sharing and long-term re-use of data, APARSEN recommends developing an Interoperable Framework for Persistent Identifiers, paving the way for a ‘Ring of Trusted Persistent Identifiers for Linked Open Data’. To enable semantic interoperability of such a Ring, this article proposes to map LODE-BD metadata with the Framework’s ontology. The Ring can be further enriched with LOD2 Technology Stack to tackle the problem of trustworthiness of linked data lifecycle while addressing the issue of Big Data.

J. A. Olvera; J. L. De La Rosa,2015,Time machine: Projecting the digital assets onto the future simulation environment,"In this paper we present the Time Machine (TiM), an environment that simulates the digital assets onto the future and allows studying what selfpreservation behaviors need the digital objects. This is based in computation intelligence and related methods of cost management under their own budget, powered by a social network as an environment that enables their behavior under the policy that preservation is to share. This approach contributes to achieve the following digital preservation requirements: adaption to unexpected situations, scalability, and efficient cost management, through an agent-based simulation. The key differentiation feature of TiM is that digital objects become active actors in their long term digital preservation, which has a digital preservation budget devoted to funding the replication of the objects and other operations such as format migration or finding a safe storage within a social network of users; in all, an environment where they will live. Its design considerations and implementation details are presented and, finally an example to illustrate some of the functionalities of the simulator. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
J. Antonio Olvera; P. Nicolas Carrillo; J. Lluis de la Rosa,2015,Evaluating Auction Mechanisms for the Preservation of Cost-Aware Digital Objects Under Constrained Digital Preservation Budgets,"This is a novel approach to managing costs in digital preservation, one that takes advantage of an object-centric approach developed by means of self-preserving digital objects whereby the objects manage their preservation not only by maximizing the chances of avoiding obsolescence but also doing it at a minimum cost. To accomplish this, we assign a budget that the objects manage to achieve the necessary preservation services at a given cost. Several strategies apply, such as maximal preservation service at all costs or burn low even if the preservation is not perfect. We explore optimizing the budget of self-preserving digital objects through micro-negotiations of objects and services, expecting accurate balance of costs and quality of preservation. Specifically, in negotiation, we will explore the price-based algorithms that are the electronic auctions, notably the combinatorial and multi-unit auctions. We compare the expected lifetime of digital objects with the two electronic auction algorithms with the aim of deciding in what conditions these algorithms apply and deliver good results. In all, this work, exploratory in nature, studies a bottom-up approach of cost management in digital preservation, contrary to the prevailing top-down approach of the state of the art, using e-auctions."

J. F. Brunelle; M. Kelly; H. SalahEldeen; M. C. Weigle; M. L. Nelson,2015,Not all mementos are created equal: measuring the impact of missing resources,"Web archives do not always capture every resource on every page that they attempt to archive. This results in archived pages missing a portion of their embedded resources. These embedded resources have varying historic, utility, and importance values. The proportion of missing embedded resources does not provide an accurate measure of their impact on the Web page; some embedded resources are more important to the utility of a page than others. We propose a method to measure the relative value of embedded resources and assign a damage rating to archived pages as a way to evaluate archival success. In this paper, we show that Web users’ perceptions of damage are not accurately estimated by the proportion of missing embedded resources. In fact, the proportion of missing embedded resources is a less accurate estimate of resource damage than a random selection. We propose a damage rating algorithm that provides closer alignment to Web user perception, providing an overall improved agreement with users on memento damage by 17 % and an improvement by 51 % if the mementos have a damage rating delta $$>$$>0.30. We use our algorithm to measure damage in the Internet Archive, showing that it is getting better at mitigating damage over time (going from a damage rating of 0.16 in 1998 to 0.13 in 2013). However, we show that a greater number of important embedded resources (2.05 per memento on average) are missing over time. Alternatively, the damage in WebCite is increasing over time (going from 0.375 in 2007 to 0.475 in 2014), while the missing embedded resources remain constant (13 % of the resources are missing on average). Finally, we investigate the impact of JavaScript on the damage of the archives, showing that a crawler that can archive JavaScript-dependent representations will reduce memento damage by 13.5 %. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Part of the mandate of the profession of records management is long-term preservation of digital and paper records. At the site of the fieldwork for this study, research participants' tasks primarily consisted of examining individual case files to determine if the files should be kept or destroyed under the relevant rules set by higher-level management according to legal requirements. Close observation of work practices showed that application of records management rules varied depending on the medium of the records, despite the policy that records on varying media are equal in importance.

J. H. Wang; H. C. Chang,2015,CoBITs: a distributed indexing approach to collaborative content-based multimedia retrieval across digital archives,"There’s more and more precious content digitized in digital archives especially for cultural heritage. It could cost much effort in digitization and archiving. To meet the requirements in a digital archiving system, several issues must be addressed. First, it usually requires resources such as computation and storage for each individual digital archive to maintain its own service. Second, the archived content would be more useful if they can be easily utilized in providing services such as searching across multiple archives. Current approaches usually adopt metadata harvesting that would build a centralized index from separate digital libraries. They usually suffer from the problem of metadata inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a distributed indexing approach to collaborative content-based multimedia retrieval across digital archives. To reduce the loads in each archive, we dynamically distribute the tasks of crawling, indexing, and query processing depending on the response time. Distributed crawler-based approach can simplify the design of indexing and query processing steps by maintaining the data to be indexed local to the machine for crawling. It can facilitate efficient archiving and indexing by automatically following the link structure of contents published on the Web. Also, it enables simpler implementation and easier support for cross-archive applications such as search and copy detection. Experimental results show the potential of the proposed approach in load balancing with appropriate task distribution. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

J. Pellegrino; M. Maggiora; W. Allasia,2015,A multi-agent approach for autonomous digital preservation,"Keeping the content of digital objects accessible is a key challenge for digital archives, especially those with limited resources dedicated to preservation. This paper describes an agent-based model that simulates processes in which a digital object become obsolescent, thus a preservation action, such as the migration to the most appropriate format, is required. Agents monitor and control the local environment and deal with preservation issues individuating obsolescent formats based on global parameters such as their diffusion. They exchange information to find out the most suitable preservation action: suggestions are evaluated and propagated according to their reciprocal level of trust. The level of trust is automatically updated after every interaction through a feedback mechanism based on stigmergy. The paper shows that the framework has a stable behaviour under several use cases. Therefore this approach is suitable for digital archives that may take advantage of a multi-agent system which can either perform an autonomous preservation action or suggest a list of best candidate solutions to the user. © 2015 IEEE."

Benedict,2015,Functional Requirements Specification for Archival Asset Management: Identification and Integration of Essential Properties of Services-Oriented Architecture Products,"The complexity and size of geospatial data can constrain the capabilities of service providers and create risks to the long-term preservation and archiving of valuable information assets. While services-oriented architectures such as the Earth Data Analysis Center's Geographic Storage, Transformation and Retrieval Engine (GSToRE1) facilitate increased use and impact of geospatial data by mitigating these complexities by development of dynamic applications and interfaces, such services can often be primarily focused on the maintenance and delivery of only the most current versions of geospatial data that may nonetheless possess significant historical, cultural, or scientific value. Actions and documentation required to assure long-term preservation may not be supported by existing business models or may be otherwise compromised. However, general purpose archives offer a preservation capability that is complementary to the value created by dynamic service providers. We present an overview of the features of GSToRE, and the DSpace2 repository platform and describe the requirements of a methodology for the harvest, quality assurance, and ingest of geospatial data into an institutional repository as a complement to the dynamic data access and visualization services provided by GSToRE and systems like it. © 2015 Jonathan Wheeler and Karl Benedict."

Heterogeneity of data adds particular challenges. The Data Virtualisation Toolkit (DVT) has been developed by the SCIDIP-ES project to support long-term access and use of heterogeneous Earth Science (ES) data in a format-independent manner. DVT provides four key functions: (a) edit format description, (b) interpret bit stream into data values using the format description, (c) construct legacy information from data values via coherent information models, and (d) visualize the retrieved legacy information if the information model is supported by the visualization component. The toolkit incorporates a tree structure editor, a bit stream interpretation engine, information models in XQuery, and a visualization component. DVT is designed to provide long term access to Earth Science data with the proper representation information which contains the technical knowledge required for interpretation. A trial application using both vector and raster data shows that DVT could provide interoperable solutions to support the long-term preservation of ES data.

For librarians to meet this demand, we also need to provide preservation, curation, metadata, and discovery services. GeoHydra, our open source toolkit and set of practices, provides these services for Stanford's libraries. We incorporate a variety of geospatial content types from raster imagery to scientific vector data to georeferenced scanned maps, and provide a data model for repositories. We demonstrate the potential of a new architecture and practice for librarianship for geospatial data using the Hydra framework. The digitization and georeferencing of historic map collections, streamlining the acquisition and cataloging of vendor-supplied data, shared cataloging of geographic resources, and citation of geospatial research data are all examples of use cases that GeoHydra serves. Our metadata creation and management strategies implement the ISO (International Standards Organization) suite of geographic standards, and a specialized metadata schema for discovery. We developed XSLT transformations, auto-generation of core elements, unique URIs for place names, and cross-institutional data sharing. With these metadata we built a novel geoportal, EarthWorks, to provide end-user discovery for geospatial data layers using GeoBlacklight technology. © 2015 Kim Durante and Darren Hardy."

Because knowledge production in archaeology depends heavily on documentation and information dissemination, and on retrieval of past documentation, the question of how information is managed is profoundly intertwined with the possibilities for knowledge production. Regulations at different levels articulate demands and expectations from the emerging digital information practices, but how are these different regulations coordinated, and do they support archaeological knowledge production? In this article we look into the state of information policy the sum of principles guiding decisions about information in archaeology and related areas. The aim of the article is to shed light on how information policy directs practice in archaeology, and to show that analysis of such policies is therefore vital. Information policy in legislation and guidelines in Swedish archaeology serves as a case study, and examples from developmentled archaeology and the museum sector illustrate how information policies have varied roles across different heritage sectors. There are historical and local trajectories in the policy documents specific to Sweden, but the discussion shows that the emergence of Swedish policies have many parallels with processes in other countries. The article provides recommendations for information policy development for archaeology and related areas."
L. Briguglio; P. K. D. Pacquing; S. Salza; M. Guercio,2015,A modular infrastructure for the management of authenticity and persistent identifiers in long-term digital preservation repositories,"Observation and experimental data have become a crucial asset for most scientific communities, which are bound to conveniently preserve them to allow reliable assessments on their provenance and integrity, based on suitable and well-documented evidence. On the other hand, these data often go through quite complex lifecycles that include both changes of custody and transformations of their representation. Managing authenticity has, therefore, become a central issue in long-term digital preservation (LTDP). In this paper, we present a model for the management of authenticity evidence, developed within two EU-funded projects, namely APARSEN and SCDIP-ES, that has led to the implementation of a modular framework, which may be exploited both in implementing new repositories and in improving existing ones. The infrastructure we propose is based on an open-source technology and specifically meant to guarantee a large degree of scalability and full interoperability among repositories that are based on it.

According to this contextualization it is related with the management of data in the different fields but with the same issues and concerns. The appropriate way to keep information through the time is with preservation parameters. The managing of massive amounts of critical data involves designing, modeling, processing and implementation of accurate system. The methods for the treatment of data have to consider two dimensions that this chapter has focused: access dimension and cognitive dimension. Both of them have relevance to get results because at the same time, ensure the correct data preservation. On the other side data management has to consider digital resources and digital artefacts and how they affect the process of preservation. In this chapter there are approaches with other authors referencing current and future studies. This chapter has been organized as follow. First in the introduction we can find ideas about the types of data in the different fields nowadays. Second, the main part, the proposal of methods in reference with other authors.

Analysis by infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS)","The preservation of manuscripts and archive materials is a serious problem for librarians and restorers. Paper manuscript is subjected to numerous degradation factors affecting their conservation state. This research represents an attempt to evaluate the conservation restoration process applied in Moroccan libraries, especially the alkaline treatment for strengthening weakened paper. In this study, we focused on six samples of degraded and restored paper taken from three different Moroccan manuscripts aged 150, 200 and 800 years. In addition, the Japanese paper used in restoration has been characterized. A modern paper was also analyzed as reference. A three-step analytical methodology based on infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) analysis was developed before and after restoration in order to determine the effect of the consolidation treatment on the paper structure. The results obtained by XRD and ATR-FTIR disclosed the presence of barium sulfate (BaSO4) in all restored paper manuscripts. The presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in all considered samples was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The application of de-acidification treatment causes significant changes connected with the increase of intensity mostly in the region 1426 cm(-1), assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric C-O stretching mode of calcite, indicating the effectiveness of de-acidification procedure proved by the rise of the alkaline reserve content allowing the long term preservation of paper. Observations performed by SEM magnify the typical paper morphology and the structure of fibbers, highlighting the effect of the restoration process, manifested by the reduction of impurities.

The digital preservation of cultural heritage monuments is a specially challenging application of 3D modelling. Cultural heritage objects and sites greatly differ from each other and a maximized fidelity of the 3D model is a core requirement.Terrestrial laser scanning is a technology that in recent years has become increasingly popular for documentation which provides very dense 3D points on an object surface with high accuracy.Moreover the resulting 3D models can be used for digital documentation as well as to perform different analysis such as measurements, conservation monitoring, feature extractions and possibly virtual restoration.This paper presents the 3D modelling of two of the most important heritage monuments in Romania: the rock sculpture of Decebalus on the Danube, Orsova and the Sphinx from Bucegi Mountains, without any loss of details or accuracy.

What role does conspicuously obsolete technology - vintage, antiquarian, and legacy - have in digital humanities practice? This chapter introduces the set of hands-on practices known as retrocomputing and explores two potential areas of digital humanities activity: data preservation and recovery, which opens opportunities for collaboration with libraries and archives; and the historical study of digital cultural forms, including creative explorations. An interest in retrocomputing also opens digital humanities to current discussions in new media fields such as platform and software studies, media archaeology, and critical code studies. I conclude with suggestions for individuals and centers interested in building their own retrocomputing collections. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

M. Khayat; S. J. Kempler,2015,Life Cycle Management Considerations of Remotely Sensed Geospatial Data and Documentation for Long Term Preservation,"As geospatial missions age, one of the challenges for the usability of data is the availability of relevant and updated metadata with sufficient documentation that can be used by future generations of users to gain knowledge from the original data. Given that remote sensing data undergo many intermediate processing steps, for example, an understanding of the exact algorithms employed and the quality of that data produced could be key considerations for these users. As interest in global climate data is increasing, documentation about older data, their origins, and their provenance are valuable to first-time users attempting to perform historical climate research or comparative analysis of global change. Incomplete or missing documentation could be what stands in the way of a new researcher attempting to use the data. Therefore, preservation of documentation and related metadata is sometimes just as critical as the preservation of the original observational data. The Goddard Earth Sciences-Data and Information Service Center (GES DISC), a NASA Earth science Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) that falls under the management structure of the Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS), is actively pursuing the preservation of all necessary artifacts needed by future users.In this article, we will detail the data custodial planning and the data lifecycle process developed for content preservation, and our implementation of a Preservation System to safeguard documents and associated artifacts from legacy (older) missions, as well as detail lessons learned regarding access rights and confidentiality of information issues. We also elaborate on key points that made our preservation effort successful; the primary points being drafting of a governing baseline for historical data preservation from satellite missions and using the historical baseline as a guide to content filtering of what documents to preserve. The Preservation System currently archives documentation content for High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS), Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) mission data, and the 1960s era Nimbus mission. Documentation from other missions like the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and the Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) are also slated to be added to this repository, as well as other mission datasets to be preserved at the GES DISC. © 2015 Published with license by Taylor & Francis."

M. Patrick; J. A. J. Wilson,2015,Getting data creators on board with the digital curation agenda. Lessons learned in developing training for researchers,"University research projects are a key source of digital information with potential long-term value. Researchers rarely need to be persuaded that preserving the fruits of their work is in principle a good thing, but may often lack knowledge of the best way to go about doing this. Additionally, time pressures on academics are such that curation can frequently end up being pushed down the priority list. It is therefore important that information professionals working alongside researchers are able to offer appropriate training and advice on both the practicalities of and the rationale for digital curation. The DaMaRO Project is one of a series of research data management projects based at the University of Oxford. The project's remit includes developing training for researchers (intended to encourage them to consider data sharing and preservation issues at an early stage in their research), plus the development of an institutional data archive (DataBank) and catalogue of datasets (DataFinder). This paper offers some reflections on our experiences thus far, and in particular looks at the question of how researchers and others who are involved in the creation of digital data may most effectively be engaged in planning for and facilitating its long-term preservation."

Design/methodology/approach – To be able to study the two repositories, the authors harvested all the files corresponding to every digital object and some of their associated metadata using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) protocols. The file formats were analyzed with DROID software and some additional tools. Findings – The results show that there is no alignment between the preservation policies declared by institutions, the technical tools available, and the actual stored files. Originality/value – The results show that file controls currently applied to institutional repositories do not suffice to grant their stated mission of long-term preservation of scientific literature. ©."
M. Vigil; C. Weinert; D. Demirel; J. Buchmann,2015,An efficient time-stamping solution for long-term digital archiving,"Long-term archiving of digital data is necessary to meet many legal requirements. For example, hospitals in many countries must keep health records of patients for decades. Archiving usually relies on digital signatures and time-stamps to prove the security properties of archived data, such as integrity and proof of existence. Moreover, archived data often needs to be updated, e.g. a new prescription is added to a patient's record, but without compromising integrity and proof of existence. To date, a solution that guarantees integrity and proof of existence indefinitely and allows for updates on archived data is Content Integrity Service (CIS). In this paper, we introduce an improved version of CIS named Content Integrity Service with Skip Lists (CISS) that changes the time-stamping process of CIS by using two different types of time-stamps together with skip lists. We demonstrate that CISS outperforms CIS by analyzing the algorithms and running experiments in realistic scenarios. © 2014 IEEE."

N. Grindley,2015,Balancing the books. The economics of digital curation training & education,"A great deal of work has been done to try and quantify the costs of digital curation and much of it has focused on assigning a cost value, either to various parts of the lifecycle of digital objects or to stages in the curation workflow. These models tend to assume that an organisational capability to curate is a given and have not tended to factor in the economic considerations associated with ensuring the relevant personnel have the skills and knowledge to do the work effectively. Training can also be understood as an investment and as such, organisations have to weigh the costs against the benefits to determine whether paying for training is worthwhile. From the perspective of standard economic theory, there may be disincentives to sponsoring training, which in turn may affect supply and demand issues and contribute to market failure in the training sector. The skills and capabilities that personnel either develop or acquire via training are all part of the complex financial equation that institutions have to solve to ensure that their digital assets remain safe and accessible. This paper will look at some of the issues related to training through an economic lens to test whether new insights emerge. The ultimate purpose is to check whether these issues have relevance for other projects and initiatives, especially the newly commenced EC-funded 4C project that is looking to help a diversity of organisations understand the true nature of investment into all aspects of digital curation, primarily through the mechanism of costs, but also through related concepts such as sustainability, value and benefits."

Initial probing into the field of digital game preservation has shown that it faces some unique problems. Different technological preservation methods that aim to keep digital games playable in the future have been proposed, but they can only preserve the game in a playable form for future generations, not convey the ways people play games now. In order to understand the ways games are played, we need to look into ways of preserving the playing context. In this paper, I discuss two preservation candidates born within the digital game community, walkthrough texts and Let's Play videos, and evaluate their suitability for long term preservation."

This three-layered pipeline is designed to capture separate concerns from the perspective of multiple disciplines such as archival studies, history and data science. In this study, our aim is to demonstrate best practices in digital archives, while facilitating innovative new methodologies in historical research. The designed pipeline is executed with a dataset of 4090 registered Irish death entries from selected areas of south Dublin City."

At the time, 3 basic cloud service models were prominent: Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS). Since then, additional models have emerged, among them Long Term Digital Preservation as a Service (LTDPaaS), a solution particularly attractive to government agencies that are responsible for public records that have permanent retention requirements. This paper assesses the current state of the art for cloud based, long-term digital preservation services and examines digital preservation standards and their applicability to cloud-based long-term digital preservation. Two cloud services based on the OAIS model are introduced, and rationale for adoption of digital preservation services from the point of view of Government agencies is provided.

Hospodor,2015,An economic perspective of disk vs. Flash media in archival storage,"For three decades, Kryder's law correctly predicted an exponential increase in bit density on disk platters, leading to an exponential drop in cost per gigabyte, and thus to an entrenched expectation that if data could be stored for a few years the incremental cost of storing it forever would be minimal. However, disk now is over 7 times as expensive as Kryder's law would have predicted, and industry projections suggest that in 2020 the gap will reach 200 times, disrupting this expectation. Our model shows that archives based upon alternative media are surprisingly cost competitive with archives based upon traditional disk media over the long-term. We propose using Archival Flash for long-term data preservation, with the trade off between longer data retention period and lower write cycles. © 2014 IEEE."

P. Mihailidis,2015,Digital curation and digital literacy: Evaluating the role of curation in developing critical literacies for participation in digital culture,"Despite the increased role of digital curation tools and platforms in the daily life of social network users, little research has focused on the competencies and dispositions that young people develop to effectively curate content online. This paper details the results of a mixed method study exploring the curation competencies of young people in digital culture. Forty-seven college students from two institutions in the north-eastern United States used the social curation platform Storify to curate essays on the topic of income inequality. Their curated stories were coded to explore for narrative development, consistency, sourcing, analysis, and content type. Regression models were used to assess clarity and balance of the curated stories, and a detailed questionnaire explored dispositions towards curation as a relevant and effective mode for engagement in digital culture. The paper argues that curation can enhance core media analysis and storytelling skills, and an understanding about the role of peer-to-peer platforms and collaborative spaces in digital culture. The results advocate the utilization of student- and creation-driven pedagogies that embrace curation as core digital and media literacy competencies for young people in daily life. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016."

In this paper, the relationship between color fidelity and imaging resolution was explored by calculating the color difference of an IT8.7/2 color chart with a CIELAB color difference formula for scanning and simulation images. Microscopic spatial sampling was used in selecting the image pixels for the calculations to highlight the loss of color information. A ratio, called the relative imaging definition (RID), was defined to express the correlation between image resolution and color fidelity. The results show that in order for color differences to remain unrecognizable, the imaging resolution should be at least 10 times higher than the physical dimension of the smallest feature in the object being studied. © 2015 Optical Society of America."

The freely accessible texts ensure the enhancement of scholarship by providing long-term discovery to an unlimited audience. Digitization and virtual reconstruction are not only crucial from a digital preservation standpoint, but also allow researchers to envision the works in the context of their intellectual and historical significance. The project also generated models for international collaboration and large-scale digitization workflows. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015."

Watanabe,2015,100-Layer recording in fused silica for semi permanent data storage,"Data storage using fused silica is a candidate archival medium for long-term preservation of important data such as official documents and cultural heritages. It is highly resistant to high temperature and chemical damage, and the Arrhenius law suggests that it would have a semi permanent lifetime. In order to improve the recording density of this type of storage, we increased the number of recording layers to 100 and achieved a recording density of 1.5 Gbyte/in.(2) without the use of an error correction code. The total bit error rate of all 100 layers was 2.3 x 10(-4), which is acceptable for practical use. The analysis of the experimental results suggests that a further increase in the number of recording layers is possible by the correction of the spherical aberration induced by a mismatch in the refractive index at the surface of a medium.

R. Knifton,2015,ArchiveKSA: Creating a digital archive for Kingston School of art,"Traditional archives of historic artefacts were not systematically acquired by Kingston School of Art during its formative years. To address the significant discrepancy between the historic practice of the art school and its material representation within holdings, ArchiveKSA emerged as a digital archiving platform. As researcher on ArchiveKSA, I am at the nexus of several alumni, student and staff communities. Collecting for ArchiveKSA involves nurturing these nascent online communities to connect personal narratives and virtual artefacts in Webs of social relations. Using ArchiveKSA as a case study, this article examines theories of online community-fostered archives and compares their functioning to traditional archives. The positioning of digital archives within memory frameworks and the possibilities of multivocality in online and physical display are areas considered, with the similarities and differences between the digital and physical versions of the archive thrown into relief. © The Author(s) 2015."
R. Mayer; G. Antunes; A. Caetano; M. Bakhshandeh; A. Rauber; J. Borbinha,2015,Using ontologies to capture the semantics of a (business) process for digital preservation,"IT-supported business processes and computationally intensive science (called e-science) have become increasingly ubiquitous in the last decades. Along with this trend comes the need to make at least the most important of these processes available for the long term, to allow later analysis of their execution, or even a re-execution. As such, the preservation of scientific experiments and their results enables others to reproduce and verify the results as well as build on the result of earlier work. All but the simplest processes require to be described by a multitude of information objects, as well as their interconnections and relations, to be successfully preserved. To enable a semantic description of these objects in a structured manner, we developed a formal meta-model that can be utilised in the digital preservation of a process. The meta-model describes classes of elements and their relations, in the form of ontologies, with a core ontology describing the generic concepts, and extension mechanisms to map supplementary ontologies describing more specific aspects. In this paper, we present the overall architecture and individual ontologies, and motivate their usefulness via the application to use cases from different domains. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
R. S. Bettivia,2015,Mapping significance properties in OAIS: A case study with video games extended poster abstract,"The term “Significant Properties” is commonly used in the fields of digital preservation and curation. It is variously defined, which puts it in tension with more precisely delineated standards for preservation, such as the broadly used Open Archival Information System reference model (CCSDS, 2012). This poster proposes mapping properties identified by both creators of video games as significant into the OAIS reference model. This research uses the framework provided by Giaretta et al. (2009), outlined as a clarification about the relationship between OAIS and significant properties, as a starting point. Utilizing data from the Preserving Virtual Worlds II grant and data from interviews with digital preservationists working in libraries and the cultural heritage sectors as case studies, this project aims to provide a real world example of how well user-defined significance maps onto commonly employed preservation models. Data from PVWII suggest that social, surface, and affective attributes of games are considered significant by designers and players. These properties encompass the totality of what really makes a game beyond the code and computing environment, even while they do not appear to fit within the precisely defined categories existent in OAIS. This poster argues that OAIS can be made to accommodate such properties because of its requirement to update archival packages as the base knowledge of the designated community changes over time.

Zani; Iop,2015,The Long Term Data Preservation (LTDP) project at INFN CNAF: CDF use case,"In the last years the problem of preservation of scientific data has become one of the most important topics inside international scientific communities. In particular the long term preservation of experimental data, raw and all related derived formats including calibration information, is one of the emerging requirements within the High Energy Physics (HEP) community for experiments that have already concluded the data taking phase. The DPHEP group (Data Preservation in HEP) coordinates the local teams within the whole collaboration and the different Tiers (computing centers). The INFN-CNAF Tier-1 is one of the reference sites for data storage and computing in the LHC community but it also offers resources to many other HEP and non-HEP collaborations. In particular the CDF experiment has used the INFN-CNAF Tier-1 resources for many years and after the end of data taking in 2011, it is now facing the challenge to both preserve the large amount of data produced during several years and to retain the ability to access and reuse the whole amount of it in the future. According to this task the CDF Italian collaboration, together with the INFN-CNAF computing center, has developed and is now implementing a long term future data preservation project in collaboration with Fermilab (FNAL) computing sector. The project comprises the copy of all CDF raw data and user level ntuples (about 4 PB) at the INFN-CNAF site and the setup of a framework which will allow to access and analyze the data in the long term future. A portion of the 4 PB of data (raw data and analysis-level ntuples) are currently being copied from FNAL to the INFN-CNAF tape library backend and a system to allow data access is being setup. In addition to this data access system, a data analysis framework is being developed in order to run the complete CDF analysis chain in the long term future, from raw data reprocessing to analysis-level ntuples production and analysis. In this contribution we first illustrate the difficulties and the technical solutions adopted to copy, store and maintain CDF data at the INFN-CNAF Tier-1 computing center. In addition we describe how we are exploiting virtualization techniques for the purpose of building the long term future analysis framework."
S. Colley,2015,Ethics and digital heritage,"This chapter uses literature review and experiences from the author’s Australian research to discuss ethical issues raised by using digital technologies in archaeology and cultural heritage practice. Technology use adds extra dimensions to principles already enshrined in professional codes of ethics such as professional standards and how to balance intellectual, cultural property and other rights against the public right to know (e.g. through open-access data policies). Additional ethical issues raised by technology include sustainability and digital preservation; the role of commercial and corporate interests in designing, developing and promoting particular products; professional and community engagement in the digital public sphere; equity of access to technology and content; and digital literacy and philosophical and sociopolitical questions about actuality and representation associated with digital heritage.

This is a semantic formalisation of the PREMIS 2.2 data dictionary of the Library of Congress. PREMIS 2.2 are metadata implementation guidelines for digitally archiving information for the long term. Nowadays, the need for digital preservation is growing. A lot of the digital information produced merely a decade ago is in danger of getting lost as technologies are changing and getting obsolete. This also threatens a lot of information from heritage institutions. PREMIS OWL is a semantic long-term preservation schema. Preservation metadata are actually a mixture of provenance information, technical information on the digital objects to be preserved and rights information. PREMIS OWL is an OWL schema that can be used as data model supporting digital archives. It can be used for dissemination of the preservation metadata as Linked Open Data on the Web and, at the same time, for supporting semantic web technologies in the preservation processes. The model incorporates 24 preservation vocabularies, published by the LOC as SKOS vocabularies. Via these vocabularies, PREMIS descriptions from different institutions become highly interoperable. The schema is approved and now managed by the Library of Congress. The PREMIS OWL schema is published at http://www.loc.gov/premis/rdf/v1. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

If a specific database is not supported from the vendor anymore, its backup tools and dump files are also unusable. Furthermore just backing up database is not a digital archiving because it doesn't guarantee long-term preserving and utilizing database contents. Therefore valuable information that stored in the databases are disappeared due to lack of archiving methods. The purpose of this paper is to design the preservation format and to implement archiving tools for a database digital archiving. For this, we first analyze OAIS reference architecture, standard of a digital archiving and SIARD format. The preservation format for database archiving is defined next based on the related works. For developing archiving tool, the JDBC Driver and the SQL:1999 are used for the accessing and managing various kinds of databases. The experimental tests are performed with the major databases; Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL. The define preservation format and archiving tool can be used for basis studies of long-term preserving of all kind of electronic documents using a database."

Kurazume; Ieee,2015,Automatic Planning of Laser Measurements for a Large-scale Environment using CPS-SLAM System,"In recent years, several low-cost 3D laser scanners are being brought to the market and 3D laser scanning is becoming widely used in many fields. For example, 3D modeling of architectural structures or digital preservation of cultural heritages are typical applications for 3D laser scanning. Despite of the development of light-weight and high-speed laser scanners, however, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still a heavy burden for the widespread use of laser scanning. We have proposed a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots named CPS-SLAM, which consists of parent robots with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers. In this system, a largescale 3D model can be acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on a parent robot from several positions determined precisely by the localization technique using multiple robots named Cooperative Positioning System, CPS. Therefore, this system enables to build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP. In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a quite precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops. This paper proposes an automatic planning technique of a laser measurement for CPS-SLAM. By planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure, it is possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment. Proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling. We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique."

A total of 724 National Science Foundation awardees completed this survey. Identifying risks and threats to digital preservation has been a significant research stream. Much of this work has been within the context of a preservation technology infrastructure such as data archives for a digital repository. This study looks at the risks and threats to research data prior to its inclusion in a preservation technology infrastructure. The greatest threat to preservation is human error, followed by equipment malfunction, obsolete software, and data corruption. Lost and mislabeled media are not components in the threat taxonomies developed for repositories; however, they do represent an important threat to research data in the lab. Researchers have recognized the need to mitigate the risks inherent in maintaining digital data by implementing data management in their lab environments and have taken their responsibility as data managers seriously; however, they would still prefer to have professional data management support."

S. Yang,2015,Topical scopes of digital and data curation curricula,"We analyzed topical scopes of two digital and two data curation curricula offered as (post)graduate certificates or specializations. We investigated a question of what the topical similarities and differences are between the curricula. To address this question: first, we identified topics from individual course and curriculum descriptions; second, we compared the topics from curriculum descriptions with each other; and third, we compared the topics from course descriptions that are part of a curriculum. We found several topics which were acting as least common denominators between two digital curation and between two data curation curricula. Such topics illustrated the fundamental components within the same type of curricula. The two common topics among all curricula were ‘standards’ and ‘management.’ This may indicate the importance of following the standards in preparation of digital (data) objects and in curatorial processes, as well as the importance of continued management of such resources in a repository. Our approach may be applicable to other types of educational opportunities such as workshops, MOOCs, and webinars. As we analyze more curation curricula, we may be able to develop a more accurate and comprehensive topical framework for the domain of digital and data curation, further enhancing the education for future digital and data curators.

T. Kärberg,2015,Digital preservation of knowledge in the public sector: a pre-ingest tool,"This paper describes the need for coordinating pre-ingest activities in digital preservation of archival records. As a result of the wide use of electronic records management systems (ERMS) in agencies, the focus is on several issues relating to the interaction of the agency’s ERMS and public repositories. This paper indicates the importance of using digital recordkeeping metadata to meet more precisely and at the same time semi-automatically the criteria set by memory institutions. The paper provides an overview of one prospective solution and describes the Estonian National Archives’ universal archiving module (UAM). A case study reports the use of the UAM in preserving the digital records of the Estonian Minister for Population and Ethnic Affairs. In this project, the preparation and transfer of archival records was divided into ten phases, starting from the description of the archival creator and ending with controlled transfer. The case study raises questions about how much recordkeeping metadata can be used in archival description and how the interaction of the agency’s ERMS and ingest by the archives could be more automated. The main issues (e.g. classification, metadata elements variations, mapping, and computer files conversions) encountered during that project are discussed. Findings show that the Open Archival Information System functional model’s ingest part should be reconceptualised to take into account preparatory work. Adding detailed metadata about the structure, context and relationships in the right place at the right time could get one step closer to digital codified knowledge archiving by creating synergies with various other digital repositories. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

In this paper, risk affecting processes are classified, followed by a discussion about particular changes stemming from web services. Three distinct approaches allowing improvements are described: a newly proposed web services monitoring framework supported by a software solution, the concept of resilient web services, which specifies new design requirements for web services, and digital preservation strategies, which apart from long-term benefits can support sustainability of currently running processes.

Along with increasing amounts of digital content and evolving DP services, there is a need for maximal automation of preservation processes from ECM systems instead of continuing current resource-consuming practices. This paper aims at a design problem definition on the integration of ECM and DP solutions. In order to motivate and to define the problem in more detail, we conducted a review on ECM and DP literatures touching the issue. The review reveals a research gap addressing a need for designing new middleware solutions for interactive processes between ECM and DP. We suggest a general-level model of three such processes between ECM and DP: preservation administration, pre-ingest, and access.

Nevertheless, one of the common denominators of current websites is that they are implemented using a Web Content Management System (WCMS). We evaluate the Website Archivability (WA) of the most prevalent WCMSs. We investigate the extent to which each WCMS meets the conditions for a safe transfer of their content to a web archive for preservation purposes, and thus identify their strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, we deduce specific recommendations to improve the WA of each WCMS, aiming to advance the general practice of web data extraction and archiving."

A series of standards have emerged in recent years which codify best practice on the preservation of digital content, and a growing community has coalesced around issues of longevity, authenticity, and digital stewardship. It has made rapid progress, borrowing promiscuously from diverse sectors. But the pace of development can be a barrier to adoption. Moreover it has been dominated in academic terms by the needs of data-intensive sciences, such as space science. Consequently there is a risk that emerging practices of digital preservation are a poor fit to the humanities. This chapter reviews some of the familiar themes from digital preservation in the last decade, asking whether they are properly tailored to support the humanities.

Y. Han,2015,Beyond TIFF and JPEG2000: PDF/A as an OAIS submission information package container,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce PDF/A to replace TIFF as the preferred file format for digitization of textual documents. In addition, PDF/A can be used as an open archival information system (OAIS) submission information package (SIP) container to reduce digitization and digital preservation costs. Design/methodology/approach – The author first reviewed the current digitization guidelines, the OAIS model and provides on an overview of the development PDF and PDF/A as international standards. Then literature review of the uses of PDF/A is presented. The author analyzed pitfalls of TIFFs as the preferred format for digitization, and showed how to use PDF/A to code digitization SIP. Findings – TIFF file format has been the preferred master file format by Federal Agency Digitization Guidelines Initiative digitization guidelines for the past 20 years. However, there are drawbacks of TIFF format. Literature reviews show that PDF/A has been the preferred standard for coding born-digital documents in court, government and business sectors. PDF/A-2 and PDF/A-3 are relatively new standards released after 2010. However, few understood the standards and have utilized the full potentials in digitization. The author shows that PDF/A can be used as an OAIS SIP container. Practical implications – In order to delivery OAIS SIPs, current practices require a combination of files, directories and various types of metadata. The author shows that PDF/A (PDF/A-2 and/or PDF/A-3) can be a better file format for textual document digitization with coding various types of metadata in extensible metadata platform and arbitrary file/data can be coded in PDF/A-3. These features in PDF/A provide much better ways to deliver SIPs in a cost-efficient manner. Originality/value – PDF/A has been recognized as the preferred standard for born-digital documents, but it has not been used as the preferred file format for digitized materials. The author recommends that: PDF/A with lossless JPX compressions as the preferred file format; and PDF/A with lossless JPX compressions along with metadata/data as the preferred OAIS SIP container. As a result, the uses reduce costs in digitization and digital preservation and also increase productivity. The author recommends to update the national and international digitization practices using PDF/A. © 2015, ."
Y. Han,2015,Cloud storage for digital preservation: Optimal uses of amazon S3 and glacier,Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to use cloud storage in digital preservation by analyzing the pricing and data retrieval models. The author recommends strategies to minimize the costs and believes cloud storage is worthy of serious consideration. Design/methodology/approach – Few articles have been published to show the uses of cloud storage in libraries. The cost is the main concern. An overview of cloud storage pricing shows a price drop once every one or one-and-a-half years. The author emphasize the data transfer-out costs and demonstrate a case study. Comparisons and analysis of S3 and Glacier have been conducted to show the differences in retrieval and costs. Findings – Cloud storage solutions like Glacier can be very attractive for long-term digital preservation if data can be operated within the provider’s same data zone and data transfer-out can be minimized. Practical implications – Institutions can benefit from cloud storage by understanding the cost models and data retrieval models. Multiple strategies are suggested to minimize the costs. Originality/value – The paper is intended to bridge the gap of uses of cloud storage. Cloud storage pricing especially data transfer-out pricing charts are presented to show the price drops over the past eight years. Costs and analysis of storing and retrieving data in Amazon S3 and Glacier are discussed in details. Comparisons of S3 and Glacier show that Glacier has uniqueness and advantages over other cloud storage solutions. Finally strategies are suggested to minimize the costs of using cloud storage. The analysis shows that cloud storage can be very useful in digital preservation. © .

Hu,2015,Mobilizing digital museum with Chinese digital archive,"Many museums have been digitalizing their collections and disseminated them to the world through the Internet. On the other hand, cloud computing and mobile communication technologies will further enhance the penetration capability of digital information, enabling mobile users surfing the wave of information world at anytime and anywhere. Nevertheless, both technologies have their own limitations, especially in handling Chinese artifacts that may hinder their applicability to the digital museums. We use the National Palace Museum (NPM) as a reference museum for the application of cloud computing and mobile communication technologies to mobilize digital museums with Chinese digital archives. A set of design guidelines specific to the NPM's services is formulated and a few prototype systems are implemented based on these guidelines: (1) Qingming Painting and Mao Gong Ding Inscription graphical exhibition and edutainment systems; (2) Mobile Digital Museum Explorer. By mobilizing, the NPM and other museums will be able to lift their world-class services to another level for the benefit of all.1 © 2015 IEEE."
Y. Tzitzikas; Y. Kargakis; Y. Marketakis,2015,Assisting digital interoperability and preservation through advanced dependency reasoning,"Digital material has to be preserved not only against loss or corruption, but also against changes in its ecosystem. A quite general view of the digital preservation problem is to approach it from a dependency management point of view. In this paper, we present a rule-based approach for dependency management which can model also converters and emulators. We show that this modeling approach enables the automatic reasoning needed for reducing the human effort required for checking (and monitoring) whether a task on a digital object is performable. We provide examples demonstrating how real-world converters and emulators can be modeled, and show how the preservation services can be implemented. Subsequently, we detail an implementation based on semantic web technologies, describe the prototype system Epimenides which demonstrates the feasibility of the approach, and finally report various promising evaluation results. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

A. E. Locher,2016,Starting points for lowering the barrier to spatial data preservation,"There is general agreement that spatial data adds particular difficulties to digital preservation due to, for example, the complexity of data models and semantics specific to individual thematic areas. However, there is a lack of literature providing an overview of the challenges and analyzing in particular the effort required to surmount these in combination with the potential added value gained through digital preservation. The Delphi method was used to evaluate obstacles to archiving geographic vector and raster data serving as a basis for topographic base map creation, seen through the lens of data producers, providers and guardians. Two international Delphi groups were questioned on developments regarding geodata, and their influences on access and preservation. The mentioned handicaps to preservation were of financial, managerial, legal, and technological in nature. The latter have a higher probability to be surmounted within at least 10 years than non-Technological. The study shows that the lack of standardization and the use of proprietary formats is still a central problem. Furthermore, the consciousness about the value of geographic assets is considered most likely to rise early. As a good starting point for improving archiving of spatial data, we also suggest the controlled disposal of superfluous data as a measure to reduce cost.

A. H. Poole,2016,The conceptual landscape of digital curation,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to define and describe digital curation, an emerging field of theory and practice in the information professions that embraces digital preservation, data curation, and management of information assets over their lifecycle. It dissects key issues and debates in the area while arguing that digital curation is a vital strategy for dealing with the so-called data deluge. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores digital curation’s potential to provide an improved return on investment in data work. Findings: A vital counterweight to the problem of data loss, digital curation also adds value to trusted data assets for current and future use. This paper unpacks data, the research enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of digital curation professionals, the data lifecycle, metadata, sharing and reuse, scholarly communication (cyberscholarship, publication and citation, and rights), infrastructure (archives, centers, libraries, and institutional repositories), and overarching issues (standards, governance and policy, planning and data management plans, risk management, evaluation, and metrics, sustainability, and outreach). Originality/value: A critical discussion that focusses on North America and the UK, this paper synthesizes previous findings and conclusions in the area of digital curation. It has value for digital curation professionals and researchers as well as students in library and information science who may deal with data in the future. This paper helps potential stakeholders understand the intellectual and practical framework and the importance of digital curation in adding value to scholarly (science, social science, and humanities) and other types of data. This paper suggests the need for further empirical research, not only in exploring the actual sharing and reuse practices of various sectors, disciplines, and domains, but also in considering the the data lifecycle, the potential role of archivists, funding and sustainability, outreach and awareness-raising, and metrics. © 2016, © ."

While appropriate and innovative preservation strategies and systems are in place for the big data communities (e.g., environmental sciences, space, and climate), the stewardship for many other disciplines, often called the long tail research domains"", is uncertain. Funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the RADAR collaboration project develops a service oriented infrastructure for the preservation, publication and traceability of (independent) research data. The key aspect of RADAR is the implementation of a two-stage business model for data preservation and publication: clients may preserve research results for up to 15 years and assign well-graded access rights, or to publish data with a DOI assignment for an unlimited period of time. Potential clients include libraries, research institutions, publishers and open platforms that desire an adaptable digital infrastructure to archive and publish data according to their institutional requirements and workflows."""
A. Krahmer,2016,Digital newspaper preservation through collaboration,"Purpose: The Texas Digital Newspaper Program (TDNP) supports newspaper preservation and access for any title in Texas, from any date, any location and representing any community. As an active member of the Texas Press Association, TDNP also supports large-scale preservation of born-digital newspaper PDF issues for member publishers. This paper aims to explore how the early days of TDNP built a strong foundation of collaboration and support for large-scale preservation projects, including support for preserving a state press association PDF newspaper collection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a case study of a collaborative endeavor to create a large-scale, statewide digital newspaper preservation hub in Texas. This paper details how individual partnerships led to new and larger partnerships. Figures and tables represent numbers of partner institutions served, numbers of newspapers preserved and screenshots of how these items appear within collections on the digital repository environment of The Portal to Texas History. This paper concludes with recommendations for groups interested in developing their own collaborative projects. Findings: As a case study, the data explored include numbers of partnering institutions, materials contributed by partnering institutions and how these numbers help to forward the TDNP agenda. Practical Implications: The final recommendations are lessons learned through collaboration, and the implications are real-world advice from the partners developed through the TDNP. Originality/value: Hosting over 3.25 million pages of newspapers, the TDNP has become an enormous hub of newspaper preservation in Texas, and it is unique in the numbers of partners it supports and the numbers of pages it is able to host for free access via The Portal to Texas History. This paper is intended to help other groups across the world build their own collaborative preservation efforts, and it offers pragmatic advice derived from hands-on experience. © 2016, © ."

A. Monteil; V. Boulétreau,2016,Archaeological contents: From open access to open data,"The activity of the researcher takes place within a global process of development of the scientific knowledge, which relies on data sharing. He or she needs both to access existing data (sources, publications), and to distribute the material produced. Open access provides a suitable tool for reaching these two objectives. Researchers must also overcome new challenges: Selecting relevant information within the huge quantity of data and ensure optimal visibility and re-usability of the data they produce. In this context, open access is not sufficient, hence the emergence of the concept of open data, which deals with technical interoperability, quality of referencing and permanence of access. Persée is a French, publically funded, program for the digitization and online publishing of printed academic journals in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences. Beyond the publication of a huge digital collection, Persée endorses the core principles of the open data movement (open access, handle/DOI, standard formats, SEO, interoperability, long term preservation). The original mission of Persée is now expanded to a new project: Producing and disseminating scientific content beyond published journals. Persée will apply its knowledge to a corpus composed of heterogeneous material. A wide range of tools is being developed in order to process, disseminate, share, and allow scientific uses of these bodies of documents. Among the collections that will be processed with these new tools in 2015, two are dedicated to archaeology: -The collection 'Monuments of Cairo' is about the digital publication of the minutes and reports of the Committee for the Conservation of the Monuments of Arab Art (published from 1882 to 1953). We intend to enrich the original material with a multilingual index for toponyms and monuments. This index uses international standards and proposes to associate to each entry the several ways it is mentioned over the whole collection. -The collection relating to the excavation of 'Salamis of Cyprus' concerns the study of material and architectural remains. It aims at firmly identifying artefacts and establishing links between several resources related to these objects: Catalogues, photographs, publications, index cards. These two projects will demonstrate the potential brought by open data regarding the constitution of digital collections. One of our objectives is to build a large-scale platform that will both federate data and be enriched, project after project, by a collection of tools addressing researchers' needs. Both data and tools will be fully and freely available to the community. © Archaeopress and the individual authors 2016. All rights reserved."

Current efforts are not adequate. Core criteria and certification processes have been developed for digital preservation repositories. Broad library support is crucial to the sustainability of third-party preservation archives. Publisher participation in thirdparty archives has grown, but coverage is incomplete and uneven, leaving some categories of materials well-covered and others vulnerable. Preservation programs need to coordinate their efforts and view themselves as collaborators rather than competitors.

A. Vellino; I. Alberts,2016,Assisting the appraisal of e-mail records with automatic classification,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how automatic classification can assist employees and records managers with the appraisal of e-mails as records of value for the organization. Design/methodology/approach: The study performed a qualitative analysis of the appraisal behaviours of eight records management experts to train a series of support vector machine classifiers to replicate the decision process for identifying e-mails of business value. Automatic classification experiments were performed on a corpus of 846 e-mails from two of these experts’ mailboxes. Findings: Despite the highly contextual nature of record value, these experiments show that classifiers have a high degree of accuracy. Unlike existing manual practices in corporate e-mail archiving, machine classification models are not highly dependent on features such as the identity of the sender and receiver or on threading, forwarding or importance flags. Rather, the dominant discriminating features are textual features from the e-mail body and subject field. Research limitations/implications: The need to automatically classify corporate e-mails is growing in importance, as e-mail remains one of the prevalent recordkeeping challenges. Practical implications: Automated methods for identifying e-mail records promise to be of significant benefit to organizations that need to appraise e-mail for long-term preservation and access on demand. Social implications: The research adopts an innovative approach to assist employees and records managers with the appraisal of digital records. By doing so, the research fosters new insights on the adoption of technological strategies to automate recordkeeping tasks, an important research gap. Originality/value: Our experiment show that a SVM classifier can be trained to replicate an expert's decision process for identifying e-mails of business value with a reasonably high degree of accuracy. In principle, such a classifier could be integrated into a corporate Electronic Document and Records Management System (EDRMS) to improve the quality of e-mail records appraisal. © 2016, © ."
A. Weber; C. Piesche,2016,Requirements on long-Term accessibility and preservation of research results with particular regard to their provenance,"Since important national and international funders of research projects require statements on the long-Term accessibility of research results, many new solutions appeared to fulfil these demands. The solutions are implemented on various scopes, starting from specific solutions for one research group up to solutions with a national focus (i.e., the RADAR project). While portals for globally standardized research data (e.g., climate data) are available, there is currently no provision for the large amount of data resulting from specialized research in individual research foci, the so called long-Tail of sciences. In this article we describe the considerations regarding the implementation of a local research data repository for the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 840. The main focus will be on the examination of requirements for, and an agenda of, a possible technical implementation. Requirements were derived from a more theoretical examination of similar projects and relevant literature, diverse discussions with researchers and project leaders, by analysis of existing publication data, and finally the prototypical implementation with refining iterations. Notably, the discussions with the researchers lead to new features going beyond the challenges of the mere long-Term preservation of research data. Besides the need for an infrastructure that permits long-Term preservation and retrieval of research data, our system will allow the reconstruction of the complete provenance of published research results. This requirement is a serious diversification of the problem, because it creates the need to qualify additional transformation data, describing the transformation process from primary research data to research results. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
A. Wilson; M. Ferreira; K. Aas; A. B. Nielsen; P. M. Tommerholt,2016,E-ARK: Harmonising Pan-European Archival Processes to Ensure Continuous Access to e-Government Records and Information,"There has been a widespread shift to electronic ways of conducting business that has transformed existing relationships between governments, governments and citizens, and governments and business. This move to electronic interactions is supported by new business systems that streamline and automate transactions, enable integration of information and service delivery and enhance collaboration between participants. Such changes in the way government business is carried out have significant implications for how public administrations document their activities and make that information available to both government and citizens to aid future decision making and accountability. Because digital records are particularly vulnerable to technological obsolescence and media decay, ensuring future access to the information created by government is a challenging issue for all jurisdictions. This paper focus on the E-ARK project, a European endeavour to standardise and create tools for consistently transferring digital records between business systems and digital archives. The E-ARK approach has the potential to simplify and make consistent diverse approaches to solving the issue of how to transfer information between the ICT systems in use in government, and the archives charged with the responsibility for ongoing and management of the information considered to be of long-term significance."
A. Young; Ipca,2016,Digital Archiving Issues for the Graphic Arts Field,"The and painstaking, but ultimately, seeing work published, even for the seasoned graphic arts professional, can still elicit a justifiable sense of excitement and pride. By comparison, strategies for ensuring the longevity of our files beyond a few years, can seem tedious and difficult, especially given the constant march of new technologies, making obsolete one digital storage system after another. Developing a design history archive for New Zealand has brought to the surface the significant dangers of failing to properly archive works in an era where increasingly more work is produced in purely digital form. This paper illuminates those dangers, not only through the failures of large institutions, but through the daily processes and attitudes demonstrated by many graphic artists. It presents the case, and suggests tactics for developing a rigorous and sustainable approach to archiving our important digital files while we still can."
B. A. Epstein,2016,In their own words: Oral histories of Medical Library Association past presidents,"Objective: The purpose of this lecture was to review the development of the Medical Library Association (MLA) oral history program and to highlight the oral histories of thirty-seven past MLA presidents to identify themes of common interest and relevance to current MLA members. Methods: The lecture focused on three main topics discussed in many of the interviews: the presidents’ backgrounds and how they came to be medical librarians, how MLA developed as an organization as a reflection of the growth of medical libraries, and the presidents’ predictions and advice about the future. Results: MLA presidents came from varied backgrounds and locales. As MLA grew from a small, intimate group into a multifaceted organization with a professional management staff, the workload of the presidents changed in scope. One recurring theme in the presidential oral histories was the power differential between men and women in the organization and the profession. MLA presidents reminisced about notable annual meetings and praised the positive impact of the organization on members’ professional and personal lives. Conclusions: The lecture concludes with recommendations to the organization to increase the availability of the oral histories by providing online access for future interviews and to pay careful attention to their long-term preservation. © 2016, Medical Library Association.

C. Dallas,2016,Digital curation beyond the “wild frontier”: a pragmatic approach,"This paper advocates the necessity of developing a pragmatic alternative to the dominant custodial theorization of digital curation as an “umbrella concept for digital preservation, data curation, electronic records, and digital asset management”. Starting from a historical account and an examination of prevalent definitions, it points to the current dependence of digital curation on a prescriptive approach rooted in its cognate field of digital preservation, aiming to serve the needs of professional stewardship. It demonstrates the disconnect of this theorization with the rich historical traditions of museum curatorship where the notion of curation originated, its inability to act as a framework for understanding the diversity and pervasiveness of contemporary digital curation practices “in the wild” (such as content curation, personal archiving, and pro-am digitization), and its dependence on a “wild frontier” ideology dissonant with contemporary critical cultural heritage scholarship. The alternative, pragmatic approach views digital curation as a “contact zone” practice, routinely performed by a broad range of actors including researchers, artists, users, and communities, on dynamically evolving objects, domain knowledge representations, and interactions, beyond the curation life cycle prescribed for custodial environments. On this basis, this study calls for a formal reconceptualization of digital curation, adequate knowledge representation of its objects, evidence-based research on curation practices, and establishment of curation-enabled digital infrastructures suitable for curation in the continuum. Reaching beyond a custodial view, this approach aims to establish digital curation as a field of intellectual inquiry relevant to emerging pervasive curation practices in the digital environment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

Harrower,2016,A semantic architecture for preserving and interpreting the information contained in Irish historical vital records,"Irish Record Linkage 1864–1913 is a multi-disciplinary project that started in 2014 aiming to create a platform for analyzing events captured in historical birth, marriage, and death records by applying semantic technologies for annotating, storing, and inferring information from the data contained in those records. This enables researchers to, among other things, investigate to what extent maternal and infant mortality rates were underreported. We report on the semantic architecture, provide motivation for the adoption of RDF and Linked Data principles, and elaborate on the ontology construction process that was influenced by both the requirements of the digital archivists and historians. Concerns of digital archivists include the preservation of the archival record and following best practices in preservation, cataloguing, and data protection. The historians in this project wish to discover certain patterns in those vital records. An important aspect of the semantic architecture is the clear separation of concerns that reflects those distinct requirements—the transcription and archival authenticity of the register pages and the interpretation of the transcribed data—that led to the creation of two distinct ontologies and knowledge bases. The advantage of this clear separation is the transcription of register pages resulted in a reusable data set fit for other research purposes. These transcriptions were enriched with metadata according to best practices in archiving for ingestion in suitable long-term digital preservation platforms. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

At the heart of this are the data resources, tools and services that ELIXIR offers to the life-sciences community, providing stable and sustainable access to biological data. ELIXIR aims to ensure that these resources are available long-term and that the life-cycles of these resources are managed such that they support the scientific needs of the life-sciences, including biological research. ELIXIR Core Data Resources are defined as a set of European data resources that are of fundamental importance to the wider life-science community and the long-term preservation of biological data. They are complete collections of generic value to life-science, are considered an authority in their field with respect to one or more characteristics, and show high levels of scientific quality and service. Thus, ELIXIR Core Data Resources are of wide applicability and usage. This paper describes the structures, governance and processes that support the identification and evaluation of ELIXIR Core Data Resources. It identifies key indicators which reflect the essence of the definition of an ELIXIR Core Data Resource and support the promotion of excellence in resource development and operation. It describes the specific indicators in more detail and explains their application within ELIXIR's sustainability strategy and science policy actions, and in capacity building, life-cycle management and technical actions. The identification process is currently being implemented and tested for the first time. The findings and outcome will be evaluated by the ELIXIR Scientific Advisory Board in March 2017.

Villella,2016,IDENTIFICATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE AND SUBSEQUENT HIGHLIGHTING OF ITS CONDITIONS BY EXPLOITING A DIGITAL PLATFORM,"In this paper a complete methodological practice to be employed for cultural heritage identification, preservation, enhancement and fruition, is proposed. The methodology is based on the active participation of both professional community and heritage users, through the utilization of a proper digital platform. In particular, the proposed method exploits a mobile app, named APP4CULTOUR, which is properly designed for allowing the users to share their own opinions and alerts, together with videos and pictures of the cultural heritage under observation, with a professional community. Then, the specialists analyze the received alert messages and plan proper in-situ surveys.

In such context the requirements for preserving the original record’s semantics, which are guaranteed by catalog systems, are reinforced. At the same time these technologies enable new cultural relevant relations to be settled between digital objects of different cultural heritage collections. What technological and methodological developments are needed to exploit the facilities brought these technologies? This paper put back the issues related to interoperability between such digital collections in light of the facilities offered by these technologies. It uses as methodology a state of the art review of theoretical and technical issues, projects, cases, etc., related to interoperability and analyses interoperability solutions based on two parameters, homogeneity/heterogeneity and the preservation of original semantic of the collections to be made interoperable. As results the role of semantic models and research on possible semantic relationships between such collections are highlighted as means to achieve interoperability, as well as, in such a context, of digital curation. © 2016, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

Päivärinta,2016,Modes of collaboration for realizing e-government benefits,"Collaboration among governmental organizations has been regarded as essential for realizing benefits of e-government investments. Inter-organizational collaboration on e-government can take several forms and can produce varying types of political, organizational, and technological benefits. However, few if any studies have delved deeper into analysis of how chosen modes of collaboration might relate to targeted e-government benefits. This paper studies multiple cases of how contemporary acquisitions and implementations of digital archiving systems have been launched through varying modes of collaboration among Swedish government agencies and municipalities. Our analysis reveals that whereas the target system, digital archive, is the same in all of the studied cases, the expected benefits varies. The article contributes by explaining how selected modes of collaboration in e-government may impact on the particular types of expected benefits. © 2016 IEEE."
C. Pramartha; J. G. Davis,2016,Digital preservation of cultural heritage: Balinese Kulkul artefact and practices,"One of the goals of digital preservation of cultural heritage is to gather, refine, maintain, and share cultural resources that can subsequently be used and developed by scholars, members of the community, and future generations. We present the details of our research dealing with one aspect of Balinese culture, the Balinese traditional communication system (kulkul), undertaken in the Indonesian island of Bali. We introduce a new framework based on Balinese cultural principles (Tri Hita Karana and Desa Kala Patra) to capture, classify, and organize cultural artefact and practice knowledge, and design and develop an online digital portal prototype to enable the sharing and growth of knowledge related to the Balinese kulkul. This knowledge is held largely in tacit form in the Balinese community, poorly documented, and fragmented, which makes the preservation difficult and yet crucial. The aim of the project is to document, preserve, and educate the Balinese community and the younger generations in particular on an important aspect of Balinese culture. This community will be encouraged not only to learn about kulkul and related practices but also contribute their own knowledge to enable the online digital portal to evolve into a living repository of Balinese cultural knowledge. The basic kulkul knowledge and understanding was obtained through in-depth interviews with selected Balinese cultural experts and knowledgeable community members (Professors from a Balinese University, spiritual leaders, senior community leaders, and craftsmen). As part of the digital portal, our project also includes the development of a basic ontology of key kulkul-related concepts and terms, and their inter-relationships to support the semantic searching and browsing of online resources. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016."
C. Schenk,2016,Model-based decoder specifications for the long-term preservation of video content,"The long-term preservation of digital data implies two aspects that are substantial: The data's binary representation (i.e., the bit sequence) must be kept restorable in its original form, and the capability to decode (or interpret) the binary representation has to be retained. The former requires failure-resistant hardware, and, in case they have to be replaced, the existence of procedures that ensure copying without loss of information. The latter is a question of how the availability of compatible decoding software can be guaranteed. A general-purpose approach is to use standard formats that have been designed for or have proven to be well suited for long-term preservation. In case of digital video content, however, such a format does not exist. Common video formats are quite complex, and the conversion of digital video content without risking any loss of authenticity or information is usually not possible. As we assume that this circumstance will not change in the near future, we propose decoder specifications as a means to describe the decoding process using different abstraction mechanisms. Being human-comprehensible and machine-processable, such a specification serves as a template, which supports a potential developer to implement a decoder prototype for an arbitrary architecture. This way, it is ensured that most commonly used formats can also be decoded on future architectures."

Lots of intangible cultural heritage would disappear. In web time, Modern digital technology and network technology enhanced the protection efforts and efficiency of cultural heritage. With the popularity of digital protection methods, there were increasingly difficulties, such as the lack of funding and concept for post-maintenance; the dynamic changes in the environment, the complex format of digital file, the lack of public support and the problem of information management brought by intellectual property rights. With the current technological level and financial support, if wanted to achieve the sustainable development of digital preservation of cultural heritage, we should establish evaluation criteria on information as soon as possible and emphasize on the collaborative conservation and hybrid protection for the pursuit of cost-effective optimization, try to maintain a relatively stable environment of protection at the same time, vigorously promote the significance of digital protection, avoid or reduce the information loss and waste of resources in the process of refreshing information and avoid dilemma of using information."

This chapter examines these challenges and reviews recent steps that attempt to find a successful way forward. The Archaeological Data Archive Project (ADAP) was operated by a single non-profit agency, the Center for the Study of Architecture/Archaeology (CSA). The cancellation of the project impacted the Archaeological Data Archive Project (ADAP), causing a revaluation of ADAP's status and its eventual termination. Cultural resource management firms, academic institutions, government agencies, and other institutions worldwide that produce archaeological data will routinely submit that data to the appropriate archive or repository for long-term preservation according to standard curation practices.

However, the complexity and change rate of common environments and information representations today have the effect that this interoperability is rarely achieved.

PAD is intended to be as flexible as possible in terms of types of material, numbers of authors and the dimensions of their archives: its main feature is an integrated quality control system that manages each single phase of a deposit almost in real time, allowing the ingestion, classification and validation of archives under strict and accurate supervision. The archival system is based on five areas: staging"", ""deposit"", ""permanent"", ""work"", and ""info"". The most difficult acquisition for PAD has been the archive of Francesco Pecoraro. It has been the best test case for procedures and workflow, for instance the ingestion of files from different media and of the materials published on his blog and on social networks. With the help of Pecoraro’s archive, the PAD team designed software that facilitates cataloguing and managing digital archives."""
E. E. Baro; K. H. Kari,2016,Digital preservation practices in university libraries: A survey of institutional repositories in Nigeria,"The purpose of the study is to investigate the digital preservation practices in institutional repositories (IRs) in Nigeria. Data from the IRs developed in university libraries in Nigeria was collected in three phases: initial phone calls, website investigation, and questionnaire. After the phone calls to librarians and website investigation of libraries of the 141 approved universities in Nigeria, the researchers found only 15 university libraries to have developed institutional repositories in Nigeria. Out of these numbers, 12 respondents, representing their university libraries were reached to respond to the questionnaire. Results from the study showed that the majority of IRs in Nigeria used DSpace software to manage their digital contents and that half of the IRs engage in information migration. The study also revealed that the majority of the responding institutions provide long-term digital preservation. Regrettably, most of the IRs do not have a digital preservation policy to guide the implementation of digital preservation for IR contents. Finally, the majority of the respondents indicated that they do not have longterm funding and lack the necessary technical staff with required skills to handle and manage the IR. The findings will inform information professionals, particularly librarians in developing countries who are planning to create institutional repositories and to provide long-term digital preservation of electronic resources in their institutions."

Despite their increasing reliance on digital documents and tools, current technologies provide little support for these specific collaborative content curation activities. We introduce CurationSpace - a novel cross-device system - to provide more expressive tools for curating and composing digital historical artefacts. Based on the concept of Instrumental Interaction, CurationSpace allows users to interact with digital curation artefacts on shared interactive surfaces using personal smart-watches as selectors for instruments or modifiers (applied to either the whole curation space, individual documents, or fragments). We introduce a range of novel interaction techniques that allow individuals or groups of curators to more easily create, navigate and share resources during content curation.

F. Sirovica,2016,Digitalisation of the archaeological field documentation of the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb,"Archaeological research most often results in large quantities of material in the form of text, photographs and drawings. These materials have, up to recently, not been available in digital form, and contain key information on the location of sites, determined archaeological con-structions and mobile archaeological findings. As this kind of material is highly susceptible to degradation and ruin, ensuring the protection of archaeological field documentation should be the mail goal of every institution that is in charge of its storage and archiving. Digitalisation pro-cedures allow for the long-term achievement of such goals, as they provide the guarantee that archaeological field documentation, as an im-portant segment of archaeological heritage, will remain preserved and available for a longer period of time. Likewise, it provides easier access to digitalised content, the possibility of connecting this content with other forms of digital information and the opportunity to utilise it in different manners, all in accordance with the current pos-sibilities and the future development of science and technology. However, the storage of the greater part of such materials is not provided for by standard museum holdings and digital archives, which rep-resents a challenging obstacle to achieving its long-term preservation and accessibility to pro-fessional and scientific processing. Therefore the purpose of the proposed procedure is to create a clear model for the digitalisation of materials collected through field research and to organise it into a coherent database, i.e. a digital archive organised in accordance with contemporary approaches to archaeological and digital data. © 2016, Archaeological museum in Zagreb.

G. Bak,2016,How soon is now? Writings on digital archiving in Canada from the 1980s to 2011,"During the 1980s and 1990s, electronic records were a source of general concern and debate among Canadian archivists. There was a heightened interest in, and increasing numbers of articles about, electronic recordkeeping projects such as the University of British Columbia (UBC) Project and the National Archives of Canada's Information Management and Office Systems Advancement (IMOSA) Project, as well as non-Canadian projects like the Pittsburgh Project. Such projects often represented a turning away from approaches established and expertise gained during the machine readable archives (MRA) era. Nonetheless, digital archival work outside of these projects continued, much of it moving in trajectories set during the MRA era. This article suggests that MRA methods, ideas, and approaches have reemerged today as foundational to contemporary digital archives theory and practice. © Greg Bak."

I pay particular attention to trends in the development of computing technologies and their use by office workers. Particularly in its early phases, this is often a story of voices from the margins. Early MRA Division manager Michael Carroll characterized digital archiving as a media specialization, a variation on textual, paper archives. Despite high-profile boosters such as Jay Atherton and Hugh Taylor, the Canadian archival mainstream remained focused on paper-based records and archival practices, even as inexpensive and user-friendly desktop-computing systems began to appear in contemporary office environments, including archives, during the 1980s.

G. Boutard,2016,"Co-construction of meaning, creative processes and digital curation: The transmission of music with live electronics","Purpose – The preservation and curation of music with real-time or live electronics is challenging. The goal is not to preserve a recording of the performance but to keep the work alive by providing the means to re-perform them. The purpose of this paper is to present the theoretical and practical outcomes of the documentation, dissemination and preservation of compositions with real-time electronics (DiP-CoRE) project. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology combines methods stemming from work psychology and ergonomics with conceptual frameworks constructed according to grounded theory. Data were collected during a six months’ creative process. Subsequent interviews were conducted during confrontations with documents, including observational recordings, sketches and technical specifications. Findings – This paper demonstrates the relevance of the proposed documentation methodology for the preservation of contemporary music with live electronics, focussing on the notion of intelligibility. It brings into light the multiple perspective of the documentation of the activity in a multi-agent creative process, which encompasses what was done but also what could have been done. Research limitations/implications – The DiP-CoRE project bring to light connections between the notion of intelligibility, the thickness of the activity and boundary objects. The paper proposes further directions of research in order to embed the designed framework within digital repositories. Practical implications – The documentation methodology, designed and tested in this paper, proposes a framework for practitioners, building on video-stimulated recall as well as documents produced during the creative process. This framework requires less expertise (but a more important technical setup) than a traditional interview-based documentation framework. It thus provides opportunities for various size organizations to build methodical documentation processes and to further build on distributed expertise with computer-supported collaborative work. Originality/value – This paper proposes a new interdisciplinary documentation methodology relevant in the artistic domain, which brings together transmission with objects and by practice. It specifically defines the relation between this proposal and a high-level model for digital curation, namely, the mixed methods digital curation model. It further creates a link between documentation best practice and the ongoing research in the tracking of creative processes. © 2016, © ."
G. Du; M. Zhou; C. Yin; J. Zhang; Z. Wu; W. Shui,2016,An automatic positioning algorithm for archaeological fragments,"One of the main challenges on digital preservation of cultural heritage is to reassemble broken fragments. However, large amounts of fragments are mixed randomly when discovered, which brings terrific difficulties for their reassembly. This paper introduces an automatic approach for positioning large mixed archaeological fragments which come from a particular kind of artifact. The main idea is to position fragments based on partial matching between fragments and a complete artifact model using the multi-scale, informative and robust Heat Kernel Signature. The positioning pipeline contains four steps: feature points extraction for fragments and the complete artifact model based on Heat Kernel Signature; initial matching between feature points by comparing their Heat Kernel Signature curves; wrong matches removing using a basis points driven refinement procedure and rigid transformation generating by selecting three pairs of points among the correct matching results using farthest points sampling. After these steps, archaeological fragments can be positioned to different positions compared with the template model, which provides not only the classification information, but also the accurate relative position. The main contributions of this paper are using a novel feature extraction algorithm based on Heat Kernel Signature to assist partial matching, and a basis points driven refinement procedure to remove wrong matches. The proposed algorithm has been tested on the Terracotta Warriors fragments, and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed positioning algorithm. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."

Other universities in related situations can also benefit from the research findings."
G. Hurley,2016,"Gordon Dodds prize: Community archives, community clouds: Enabling digital preservation for small archives","Small, local, independent, and oftentimes idiosyncratic, the many community archives across the globe are commonly considered the least prepared to undertake digital preservation activities. Taking up the concept of archives as a “place of preservation” and putting it in conversation with the distinct areas of scholarship on community archives and cloud computing, I argue that community archives are enabled by cloud-computing solutions to begin acquiring and preserving born-digital records. To do so means re-imagining the boundaries of where preservation takes place. I outline the concepts that define community archives in the Anglo-American context, discuss these ideas in relation to preservation and place, and connect them with a review of potential cloud-computing implementations and case examples for small archives. Embedded alongside records creators that represent a broad spectrum of organizations, people, and interests, community archives are ideally positioned to acquire the digital records of persons, businesses, and organizations that may escape large, institutionally based archives. The very distributed nature of community archives will enable them to contribute to a more networked approach to digital preservation, one that reflects the networked structure of cloud computing itself. © 2016, Association of Canadian Archivists.

G. Michetti,2016,Provenance: An Archival Perspective,"Archival provenance is a complex concept, the sum of different factors that altogether trace archival records back to their creation and through their management and use. Provenance plays a major role in different archival functions, from arrangement and description to preservation. Therefore, principles and methods for capturing and representing provenance have been developed over a long time in the archival domain. However, further research in this area is needed to cope with the challenges and opportunities of new technology—on the one hand, the digital environment has made it extremely easy to mix and re-use digital objects, to a point that it is often difficult to trace provenance; on the other hand, tools like Resource Description Framework (RDF) can be used to represent provenance through new standards and models. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
H. Esmaeili; H. Thwaites; P. C. Woods,2016,E-Reconstruction and e-archiving of iconic architectural heritage: A complete example,"This paper presents a real case of virtual preservation of an architectural heritage right before its disappearance, in absence of protection. This covers many different areas from technical aspects to history of the building and its importance in a way that the archived information can be useful for various target audiences e.g. historians, architects, and many others. Conservation of national heritage in developing countries especially in Southeast Asia is plagued by 'Conservation-Development Conflicts'. Buildings that should have been protected as national heritage have been demolished. Digital archiving is an insurance to record the buildings that have architectural or historical merit but are not gazetted as national heritage and are left without protection against future demolition. This paper reports part of a project-Post-Independence Architecture Atlas' by the University of Malaya, in collaboration with Multimedia University, Malaysia. A total of 30 buildings and other structures were fully recorded in the first stage. The Pekeliling Flats also known as 'Tunku Abdul Rahman Flats' were constructed during 1960s as the first pilot project for introducing Industrialized Building System to Malaysia aiming at affordable-housing for the low-income group. These flats were the second high-rise residential buildings in Malaysia after the Suleiman Courts. Despite their historical significance, being the first high-rise residential buildings in Kuala Lumpur, the Suleiman Courts were demolished in 1986. There appear to be no records of the Suleiman Courts such as technical data or plans. The situation for the Pekeliling Flats was the same as the Suleiman Courts and no official records of the technical data were found during the investigation. The Pekeliling Flats demolition started in January 2014 and was estimated to be finished by November 2015 (finished earlier). A decision was made to virtually reconstruct these flats to be digitally preserved for the future. Full 3D reconstruction was performed including the full coverage videography (using drones) and photography.

H. Moulaison Sandy,2016,"Report from Libraries in the Digital Age (LIDA), June 13–17, 2016, Zadar, Croatia","Libraries in the Digital Age (LIDA) 2016 takes place every 2 years, and was held this year at the University of Zadar, in Zadar, Croatia, from June 13–17, 2016. Each LIDA, two themes are chosen in advance. This year, the themes were “Digital Curation and Preservation: Current Trends and Research” and “Use Studies, Education, and Training for Digital Library Collections.” A presentation of each theme by university professors and subsequent keynotes relevant to each theme by two world-renowned experts provided context and ensured a shared perspective among LIDA attendees. Conference-goers were presented a balanced approach to theoretical and practical questions in a number of areas of digital libraries, including the presentation of research on information seeking practices among special communities, data mining projects, the exploration of platforms and experiences, and digitization. Additionally, a number of the contributed papers, panels, demonstrations, and workshops spanned the two themes, making for not only an informative conference, but also a particularly rich and coherent experience for attendees. Opportunities for junior researchers were numerous, with the conference priding itself on the mentorship opportunities available. In 2018, you might find yourself tempted to see what LIDA is all about; if you do, you will no doubt find yourself in a breath-taking venue along the Croatian coast surrounded by engaged, supportive, and collaborative researchers and professionals from around the world – in my opinion, you won't regret it. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis."

I. Kouper,2016,Professional participation in digital curation,"Digital curation is being recognized as a new domain that demands its own skills and expertise. The perceived or occurring professionalization of digital curation calls for a deeper analysis of what it means to do digital curation. Drawing on the findings of an online survey of professionals, who identify themselves as digital curators, this research offers insight into who digital curators are, what they do, and how they describe their skills and the relevance of these skills to their jobs. Having synthesized definitions of digital curation and profiles of digital curators, the study distinguishes between top-down and bottom-up professionalization and identifies similarities and differences between them. While the top-down, agenda driven approach offers coherence and consistency for digital curation as a profession, the bottom-up, practitioners-driven approach thrives on inclusiveness and heterogeneity. The study concludes by pointing out the lack of certain themes in the professional discourses, such as the themes of user communities, open access, and advocacy. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

J. Erima; W. Masai; M. G. Wosyanju,2016,"Preservation of digital research content in academic institutions: A case study of Moi University, Kenya","The digital age has presented the academic society with new opportunities. Academic institutions are increasingly moving towards digital presentation of corporate Information, such as web sites that contain prospectuses, course guides and corporate policies. Most of the intellectual assets of academic institutions, including research content, are also increasingly being produced and held in digital form, thus demanding new approaches to their preservation to ensure long-Term value for teaching, research and development. This highlights the importance of an appropriate and effectively implemented digital preservation framework to ensure that these digital resources are properly maintained if their potential value is to be realized. This study endeavors to assess the current state of preservation of academic research content at Moi University (MU); the extent to which these materials have been digitized, with a view to proposing an appropriate strategy for their successful preservation. The specific objectives of the study are to: identify and classify the types of research content produced in MU; establish the different forms and categories in which these materials are stored; assess the existing digital preservation practices used to preserve these research assets; establish the challenges faced in the preservation of these materials; propose an appropriate preservation strategy to digitize and preserve these research content.

J. F. Brunelle; M. Kelly; M. C. Weigle; M. L. Nelson,2016,The impact of JavaScript on archivability,"As web technologies evolve, web archivists work to adapt so that digital history is preserved. Recent advances in web technologies have introduced client-side executed scripts (Ajax) that, for example, load data without a change in top level Universal Resource Identifier (URI) or require user interaction (e.g., content loading via Ajax when the page has scrolled). These advances have made automating methods for capturing web pages more difficult. In an effort to understand why mementos (archived versions of live resources) in today’s archives vary in completeness and sometimes pull content from the live web, we present a study of web resources and archival tools. We used a collection of URIs shared over Twitter and a collection of URIs curated by Archive-It in our investigation. We created local archived versions of the URIs from the Twitter and Archive-It sets using WebCite, wget, and the Heritrix crawler. We found that only 4.2 % of the Twitter collection is perfectly archived by all of these tools, while 34.2 % of the Archive-It collection is perfectly archived. After studying the quality of these mementos, we identified the practice of loading resources via JavaScript (Ajax) as the source of archival difficulty. Further, we show that resources are increasing their use of JavaScript to load embedded resources. By 2012, over half (54.5 %) of pages use JavaScript to load embedded resources. The number of embedded resources loaded via JavaScript has increased by 12.0 % from 2005 to 2012. We also show that JavaScript is responsible for 33.2 % more missing resources in 2012 than in 2005. This shows that JavaScript is responsible for an increasing proportion of the embedded resources unsuccessfully loaded by mementos. JavaScript is also responsible for 52.7 % of all missing embedded resources in our study. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

We adopted Reverse Engineering technology to rebuild the shape of object by capturing point-cloud data from different angle, encapsulating and fitting these data into triangular mesh model. We then utilized Augmented Reality to achieve the virtual demonstration of ceramic object, which integrated the 3D reconstructed model with real environment from digital camera. To get a better interaction experience, we have developed a demonstration system with osgART and its scene graph, which can position ceramic object by a mark, transform digital model by mouse and menu, and display brief information. The developed technology and methods can be used in digital preservation of ceramic cultural relic and product design, evaluation or demonstration"
J. H. Clark,2016,The Long-Term Preservation of Digital Historical Geospatial Data: A Review of Issues and Methods,"For quite some time, librarians and archivists have been concerned with the long term preservation of all manner of digital objects in their collections. More recently, scholars who have often spent years developing Geographic Information Systems for historical analysis have come to the realization that the more information technology evolves, the less likely it is that the historical geospatial data which they have painstakingly created will be accessible for many years to come. Further complicating the issue is the multiplicity of data structures that can make up the collection of geospatial information necessary for the instantiation of a map view. While there are currently no permanent solutions to these issues, there are a number of prudent steps that can be taken to preserve such data past the short-term, thus making it more likely that these valuable cultural resources can be migrated in step with advancing technologies well into the future. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

J. R. Baron; A. Thurston,2016,What lessons can be learned from the US archivist’s digital mandate for 2019 and is there potential for applying them in lower resource countries?,"Purpose: This paper aims to present a high-level summary of the US archivist’s digital mandate for 2019, embodied in the publication “Managing Government Records”, issued on August 24, 2012, and a summary of US policy. The authors then consider the implications of the US e-recordkeeping initiative for lower-resource countries. Design/methodology/approach: After setting out key elements of the US Archivist’s digital mandate, the paper proceeds to evaluate its policy implications for lower-resource countries based on the authors’ field experience and knowledge of case studies. Findings: The USA is embarking on a state of the art approach for managing public sector archives in a digital form, with deadlines approaching for all federal agencies to manage e-mail and other e-records. Although a similar need exists in lesser-resourced countries, there are enormous barriers to successful implementation of a similar approach. Research limitations/implications: The archivist’s 2019 digital mandate assumes that the technology sector will embrace the needs of public sector agencies in working on applicable electronic archiving solutions. Practical implications: The Archivist’s Directive has the potential to be an enormous driver of change in the records management profession with respect to future management of increasingly digital archive collections. Vast collections of public sector e-mail and other forms of e-records potentially will be preserved under the directive, raising the stakes that archivists and records managers work on solutions in the area of long-term preservation and future access. Social implications: The importance of capturing the activities of public-sector institutions in all countries for the purpose of openness, transparency and access cannot be overstated. In an increasingly digital age, new methods are needed to ensure that the historical record of governmental institutions is preserved and made accessible. Originality/value: The US Archivist’s mandate represents a cutting-edge approach to long-term digital archiving with potential future applicability to the management of public sector records worldwide. © 2016, © ."

The keynote includes recent empirical results and recommendations for good practice and further research. In particular, the paper is based on an assessment of 864 print and electronic dissertations in sciences, social sciences and humanities from the Universities of Lille (France) and Ljubljana (Slovenia), submitted between 1987 and 2015, and on a survey on data management with 270 scientists in social sciences and humanities of the University of Lille 3. The keynote starts with an introduction into data-driven science, data life cycle and data publishing. It then moves on to research data management by PhD students, their practice, their needs and their willingness to disseminate and share their data. After this qualitative analysis of information behaviour, we present the results of a quantitative assessment of research data produced and submitted with dissertations Special attention is paid to the size of the research data in appendices, to their presentation and link to the text, to their sources and typology, and to their potential for further research. The discussion puts the focus on legal aspects (database protection, intellectual property, privacy, third-party rights) and other barriers to data sharing, reuse and dissemination through open access. Another part adds insight into the potential handling of these data, in the framework of the French and Slovenian dissertation infrastructures. What could be done to valorise these data in a centralized system for electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs)? The topics are formats, metadata (including attribution of unique identifiers), submission/deposit, long-term preservation and dissemination. This part will also draw on experiences from other campuses and make use of results from surveys on data management at the Universities of Berlin and Lille. The conclusion provides some recommendations for the assistance and advice to PhD students in managing and depositing their research data, and also for further research. Our study will be helpful for academic libraries to develop assistance and advice for PhD students in managing their research data, in collaboration with the research structures and the graduate schools. Moreover, it should be helpful to prepare and select research data for long-term preservation, curate research data in open repositories and design data repositories.

The ADS does this by preserving digital data in the long-term and by promoting and disseminating, open and free datasets, gathered from all sectors of archaeology. An integral component of the ADS remit has been the life-cycle principle of preservation, curation and dissemination of data in order to enable re-use. The ADS practices a combination of normalization, version migration, format migration and refreshment for the active management and ongoing preservation of all archived data types. This paper highlights the importance of the ongoing management of research data for long-term preservation. In particular this paper focuses on the challenges of migrating spatial data, specifically Computer Aided Design (CAD) files. Successful data migration of these files ensures that data is accessible and usable, and provides many opportunities through data re-use to combine and re-interrogate datasets, allowing new archaeological interpretations to be developed. © 2016 by the authors."
K. K. Adu; L. Dube; E. Adjei,2016,"Digital preservation: The conduit through which open data, electronic government and the right to information are implemented","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the extent to which digital preservation facilitate the implementation of electronic government, open data and the right to information. Design/methodology/approach: A case study research which chronicles the link between transparency and data availability. It makes use of a theoretical framework based on the open archival information system to analyse, explain, clarify and justify the application of open data, electronic government and the right to information. Findings: The paper argued that e-government, open data and the RTI will remain elusive if a digital preservation infrastructure is not pursued. Within the context of e-government, the paper adumbrated that government agencies can incorporate e-government legislations into their digital preservation activities, precisely because the relationship between digital preservation and e-government have always been symbiotic. It alluded to the fact that an obligation will be placed on all public authorities and private agencies covered by the RTL law to create, keep and organise an effective and efficient system of record keeping, so as to give meaning to the right to information when citizens apply for information. Practical implications: Future research should examine closely the implication of open data government within the context of digital preservation. Whilst digital preservation looks forward to the longevity of digital records and its accessibility, open data focusses on the utility of these records through online services, reuse and distribution for the purposes of transparency and citizens’ participation. Originality/value: The application of digital preservation to open data in this paper appears to be more relevant at a time when most governments of the world are striving to obtain data to fight poverty, achieve universal primary education, fight HIV and foster maternal health. Its originality can further be established from the symbiotic relationship between digital preservation and electronic government, open data and the right to information. © 2016, © ."
K. K. Adu; P.

Design/methodology/approach: Guided by a conceptual framework, underpinned by a quantitative approach, the paper uses the survey approach, to address the digital preservation strategies deployed across public sector organisations in Ghana. It underscores the link between the conceptual framework and the literature to analyse the various digital preservation strategies. Findings: Backup strategy, migration, metadata and trusted repositories were noted as the most widely implemented preservation strategies across the ministries and agencies. On the other hand, cloud computing, refreshing and emulation were the least implemented strategies used to address the digital preservation challenges. Research limitations/implications: The paper adds to the existing conceptual underpinnings that have dominated the debate about data management, archival storage, preservation strategies, challenges and best practices of digital preservation of e-government. Originality/value: This study draws its originality from the evidence of studies on digital preservation in Ghana as most studies have rather focussed on the preservation of documentary heritage, preservation and security of microfilms, preservation practices in the public records (Akussah, 2002; Ampofo, 2009; Festus, 2010). The emergence of this study addresses the knowledge gap in the preservation of digital records in a country where little attention has been accorded to digital preservation.

Cultural heritage is constantly under threat of terrorist attacks and natural disaster. The high costs related to documentation task have prevented a constantly and massive survey activity. The low cost 3D image based acquisition and elaboration techniques of an object, allow to carry out a 3D photorealistic model in a short time. Therefore, a lot of museum adopted these techniques for the artworks archiving. Crowdsourcing activities can significantly speed up survey and elaboration procedures. If, on the one hand, these initiatives can have a positive impact, on the other hand involve the online user with a marginal role.

L. M. Ungerer,2016,Digital curation as a core competency in current learning and literacy: A higher education perspective,"Digital curation may be regarded as a core competency in higher education since it contributes to establishing a sense of metaliteracy (an essential requirement for optimally functioning in a modern media environment) among students. Digital curation is gradually finding its way into higher education curricula aimed at fostering social media literacies. Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material. There as yet appears not to be a pedagogy that fully acknowledges the various digital curation processes. A pedagogy of abundance, acknowledging that content often is freely available and abundant, may eventually prove relevant in this regard."

The region of interest, resolution, rotation and file format can be indicated on the URL. However, most of the current implementations are not specifically designed for the uses in an environment were persistence and permanence is crucial. A well implemented and embedded IIIF-server has therefore positive implications to the organisation of long-term preservation of digital image files.

L. Shala; A. Shala,2016,File Formats - Characterization and Validation,"Nowadays, most of the information is stored digitally. Digital information is from a high level of view it is just an array of bits. In order to figure out its real meaning special software which interprets it is required. Therefore, if by evolution of technology this software cannot be executed anymore there is potential risk that also the data interpreted by it becomes not useful. The goal of Digital Preservation is to stop occurrences of such phenomenon. Data is commonly stored in files each file has a specific format or structure, by knowing it user can figure out the real meaning of raw data stored in the file as an array of bits. Digital Preservation considers valid file format as a perquisite for file to be in usable form, with valid is meant that a specific file is structured conform its declared file format. In this paper we throw a spotlight on the accuracy and capability of these file validation tests. Therefore, we present some open source software which are able to automatically identify and verify the file format. We focus more on file types they can identify, and how they work in large scale data sets. © 2016"

Most of the projects were initiated by the librarians in cooperation with information and communication technology personnel. The selection of the materials for digitization was based on demand, the condition of the print format, and importance of the materials for future use. Conversion into microfilm from digital format, use of Internet mirror sites, and off-site repositories of data on hard disks were some of the preservation methods practiced by libraries. Challenges faced by digital curation activities include the need to develop digital curation skills of information professionals and researchers, and to develop the information infrastructure of the institutions and the country. © 2016, The authors."

At an early stage in the research project, the curators gathered requirements from prospective users of the dataset, focusing on how and for which research projects they would reuse the data. Users needs informed which curation tasks to conduct, which included: adding more information elements to the dataset to expand its content scope; removing personal information; and, packaging the data in a size, a format, and at a frequency of delivery that are convenient for access and analysis purposes. The curation tasks are embedded in the software that produces the data, and are implemented as an automated workflow that spans various HPC resources, in which the dataset is generated, processed and stored and the Texas ScholarWorks institutional repository, through which the data is published. Within this distributed architecture, the integrated data creation and curation workflow complies with long-term preservation requirements, and is the first one implemented as a collaboration between the supercomputing center where the data is created on ongoing basis, and the University Libraries at UT Austin where it is published. The targeted curation strategy included the design of proof of concept data analyses to evaluate if the curated data met the reuse scenarios proposed by users. The results suggest that the dataset is understandable, and that researchers can use it to answer some of the research questions they posed. Results also pointed to specific elements of the curation strategy that had to be improved and disclosed the difficulties involved in breaking data to new users."

However, the news stories published online are in danger because of reasons like constant change in the technologies used to publish information and the formats for publication.Certain institutions or individuals may be interested in preserving news stories related to a particular event or topic. The stories should be collected from various online newspapers and preserved for the long term. The major issue in the preservation process is that newspapers use different formats for online publication of the stories. The paper presents a tool which is developed to addresses the issue. The tool facilitates users in the extraction of news stories from various online newspapers and migration to a normalized format."

Design/methodology/approach – In total, 86 ARL members submitted institutional profiles that were analyzed using Atlas.ti and surfaced major themes that comprise the mission of research libraries including serving the public good, expanding their presence globally, setting standards for access and quality, needing to explore best practices, and being visible at the national and international levels. Findings – The analysis of the narratives identified three key areas for DL developments: first, digitized special collections, second, acquiring digital content, and third, developing digital services (Figure 1). Specific examples and context are provided in the paper. Research limitations/implications – The qualitative data collected from these profiles demonstrate that libraries are transforming their services to leverage digital technologies and meet the changing needs of their users. The approach was open ended and allowed libraries to celebrate their strengths and unique context. Some of the disadvantages of this approach include the amount of work both on behalf of the participating libraries as well as on behalf of the analysts and the difficulty of comparing libraries with one another. Originality/value – This was the first time ARL attempted to describe research libraries using narrative descriptions. The approach complements the traditional ARL Statistics and offers a viable alternative in a future environment that is dominated by radical change. This qualitative approach deployed here is critical for describing DL developments as current large-scale digitization projects have extended the directions that were surfacing in these profiles and have major implications for the future of digital content and research. Future research in this area is strongly encouraged. © 2016, © ."

M. Moss,2016,Opening Pandora’s Box: What is an Archive in the Digital Environment?,"The principal issue that this chapter seeks to explore is the responsibility of archivists for ensuring that their collections more fully represent all within society, including those from the periphery and the margins and those with alternative or unorthodox opinions, and not just dominant and institutional elements. Taking this responsibility seriously requires archivists to acknowledge their role as active agents in the process of collecting and constructing archival heritage, reliance on passive accumulation or serendipity being particularly unsustainable in this context. In practice this means archivists intervening proactively within a national and perhaps international framework to identify and support the preservation of contemporary collections for future. It examines how the implications of this collecting, both in terms of the technical challenges and the practical professional duties, means that the archive profession must focus increasingly outwards from its repositories and into partnerships with information technology and digital curation experts, and with community and campaigning organizations. © 2008 Louise Craven.

N. Campos-López; O.

Without a clear documentation and records of changes, research on the creation and modification of information systems and its associated data is almost impossible. To ease these problems, the EU-funded project PERICLES follows a model-driven preservation approach, where the digital ecosystem is modelled and updated constantly to handle changes for generating a holistic record on information systems involvement. For realising this approach, we present in this paper the PERICLES Process Compiler, which consumes descriptive models of changing environments and evolving semantics to generate executable workflows that are capable of reenacting changes in information systems and mitigate their impact. By this, our contribution narrows the gap between the theory of model-driven preservation and its application in real information system environments.

N. Lagos; J. Y. Vion-Dury,2016,Digital preservation based on contextualized dependencies,"Most of existing efforts in digital preservation have focused on extending the life of documents beyond their period of creation, without taking into account intentions and assumptions made. However, in a continuously evolving setting, knowledge about the context of documents is nearly mandatory for their continuous understanding, use, care, and sustainable governance. In this work we propose a method that considers the preservation of a number of interdependent digital entities, including documents, in conformance with context related information. A change that influences one of these objects can be propagated to the rest of the objects via analysis of their represented dependencies. We propose to represent dependencies not only as simple links but as complex, semantically rich, constructs that encompass context-related information. We illustrate how this method can aid in fine-grained contextually-aware change propagation and impact analysis with a case study."

This synergy has created a new research subject: virtual cultural heritage, with specific challenges and with the key issue being to reconstruct the 3D virtual model of a real cultural artefact or item. We propose that by transcending the classic 3D reconstruction instruments to online services available remotely these newly appeared challenges can be properly addressed and the 3D reconstruction process will gain in accessibility and availability for a wider range of scientists, researchers and users. This paper presents an original implementation of such 3D reconstruction services that create virtual models based on data obtained from a 3D scanning system operating on the laser striping principle. This solution is intended to be used for digital preservation efforts of the cultural artefacts from the Brasov history museum by creating a digital archive with their 3D virtual models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

P. Fornaro; L.

It will be shown what significance digital file formats in a digital preservation workflow have and how they affect the success of digital archiving. Besides basic format requirements, like following an open standard and being widely used, we will discuss technical details of existing format definitions and their ability to encapsulate metadata for successful preservation. Based on the well-known Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) we will show in detail what weaknesses exist, that endanger the correct future rendering of the content. As a result a recommendation for an image file format definition for archival needs is proposed, based on the already existing widespread and accepted standard TIFF. The proposed approach follows the concept of a limited subset of a given file format like it is done with the Portable Document Format (PDF) and its archival derivative PDF/A. The approach results in a recommended use of the TIFF baseline specification.

P. Franks,2016,Enterprise content management and digital preservation online education: A case study,"Knowledge workers must recognize the value of information to the organization and be able to handle it responsibly regardless of its stage within the information lifecycle-creation, storage, active use, or long-term preservation. An information professional who understands how content, whether records or information, is best managed at each stage of the lifecycle is in a better position to contribute as part of a team charged with addressing information governance challenges than a professional who is an expert in only one aspect of the information lifecycle. In this highly competitive employment environment, those professionals trained in records and information management as well as archival science, including digital preservation, increase their opportunities to move into positions of responsibility at their current place of employment or to obtain more attractive positions elsewhere. This paper describes the approach taken to introduce online students in the School of Information at San José State University to the concepts of enterprise content management and digital preservation within the framework of a community of practice. It describes how Constructivist Learning Theories were applied to enable students to acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to adapt quickly and easily to emerging technologies and the resultant changes in the workplace. It addresses the question of how virtual experiential learning opportunities can be provided to reinforce newly acquired knowledge. In light of suggestions that the responsibility for determining what should be preserved and how should be placed in the hands of the creators of digital data, this paper emphasizes the need for knowledge workers and other information professionals to be aware of the preservation challenges presented at each stage of the information lifecycle. Contrary to the focus on open source applications in many digital preservation courses, this paper details the steps taken to provide students with hands on experience with several commercial cloud-based platforms in use by private organizations and government agencies within the United States. The planning process employed to make Office 365/SharePoint Online available for content creation, storage, and use; Preservica for long-term digital preservation; and WordPress to provide public access to digital objects is shared. This paper reports on the learning that took place as students created, identified, captured, evaluated, retrieved, transformed, and shared enterprise information assets utilizing cloud-based software systems. It describes the learning management system that contained lectures, reading assignments, and discussion topics utilized for knowledge construction and sharing. And it expresses the value of social networking tools, including Yammer and student profiles within Office 365, to facilitate communications within the community. This model can be applied to training and education at other educational institutions and in corporate and government settings."

Using tape and hard disk as storage medium can not meet the demands of long-term data preservation. Current blu-ray inorganic disc is able to store data more than 50 years, the fact that the drive and optical disc is separate makes it easy for optical disc to be stored. Optical disc is proved to be a choice for long term preservation. But the capacity of optical disc is too small compared to tape and hard disk, which limits its use in archival storage system. A novel large- scale Automation optical library system is introduced, a standard rack contains more than 10 000 discs, provides 1 GB/s throughput. The fundamental thought is tiered storage with HDD, SSD and optical disc and storage virtualization. HDD and SSD works as cache for optical storage level, thus improve performance; all the optical discs are set to a virtual volume pool. Optical library system implements automatic mechanical dispatch, file access and disc recording by the integration design controll and inner data structure.

R. S.

Information practitioners, particularly those who work with varied populations and popular materials such as public- or state-sponsored libraries and museums, complain that this term is counter to their professional, ethical, and legal mandates to serve many types of user. Using interview data from digital preservation practitioners and scholars as well as interview data from OAIS authors, the author examines the meaning and history behind this term and what it prescribes for professional digital preservation practice. This work juxtaposes contentions of digital preservation practitioners with explanations provided by the authors of OAIS about the Designated Community term. The findings in this paper support the author's contention that alternative digital preservation models and metrics are necessary within cultural heritage institutions, like libraries and museums, to meet the professional standards of practice in those areas and to ensure the inclusion of broad populations within the user bases of digital repositories.

However, once mass digitization is possible, the subsequent bottleneck to overcome is the annotation of cultural heritage artefacts with provenance data. Current annotation tools are mostly based on textual input, eventually being able to link an artefact to documents, pictures, videos and only some tools already support 3D models. Therefore, we envisage the need to aid curators by allowing for fast, web-based, semi-automatic, 3D-centered annotation of artefacts with metadata. In this paper we give an overview of various technologies we are currently developing to address this issue. On one hand we want to store 3D models with similarity descriptors which are applicable independently of different 3D model quality levels of the same artefact. The goal is to retrieve and suggest to the curator metadata of already annotated similar artefacts for a new artefact to be annotated, so he can eventually reuse and adapt it to the current case. In addition we describe our web-based, 3D-centered annotation tool with meta- and object repositories supporting various databases and ontologies such as CIDOC-CRM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

It inspects various instances of Indian web-based DSpace systems including the nature and growth of collection, the geographical distribution of DSpace systems and the types of institutions that adopt and maintain DSpace. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from the official website of DSpace, Google search and from online discussion forums during July 2013 to January 2014. The 132 Indian DSpace links provided in the official DSpace website were examined. Further search was carried out on Google to identify Indian IRs and DLs that are not listed by the official website. A list of Indian DSpace websites prepared by the authors was sent to the online discussion forums for further updating. An online directory of Indian DSpace websites was created using WordPress which provided for the adding of comments. The study is limited to the web-based DSpace IRs and DLs in India. Findings – The majority of the Indian IRs and DLs listed on the official website of DSpace are not visible on the internet. Many links lead to institution websites, commercial websites and personal pages of authors. Out of 132 DSpace links, only 55 are visible on the internet to search and use. Indian libraries prefer DSpace over EPrints, Fedora and Greenstone. Many institutions could not maintain continuity of their DSpace systems in the online environment. Institutions having more funding are maintaining web-based DSpace systems. The size, economic conditions, rate of literacy and number of universities in an Indian state do not influence the maintenance of digital systems. Academic institutions involving universities, technical institutions and colleges lead in the adoption and maintenance of web-based DSpace in India. Private universities and colleges have adopted DSpace for IR/DL. Public libraries constitute a minimum percentage of web-based DSpace instances. Indian courts and Parliament have adopted DSpace. Shodhganga, the Indian ETD project, is running on DSpace. Originality/value – This is the first paper examining the adoption of DSpace by Indian libraries with a focus on online visibility and the strength of collection. It can be used to understand the pattern of technology adoption by Indian libraries over the years. © 2016, © ."

S. Darányi; P. Wittek; K. Konstantinidis; S. Papadopoulos; E. Kontopoulos,2016,A physical metaphor to study semantic drift,"In accessibility tests for digital preservation, over time we experience drifts of localized and labelled content in statistical models of evolving semantics represented as a vector field. This articulates the need to detect, measure, interpret and model outcomes of knowledge dynamics. To this end we employ a high-performance machine learning algorithm for the training of extremely large emergent self-organizing maps for exploratory data analysis. The working hypothesis we present here is that the dynamics of semantic drifts can be modeled on a relaxed version of Newtonian mechanics called social mechanics. By using term distances as a measure of semantic relatedness vs. their PageRank values indicating social importance and applied as variable 'term mass', gravitation as a metaphor to express changes in the semantic content of a vector field lends a new perspective for experimentation. From 'term gravitation' over time, one can compute its generating potential whose fluctuations manifest modifications in pairwise term similarity vs. social importance, thereby updating Osgood's semantic di?erential. The dataset examined is the public catalog metadata of Tate Galleries, London."

S. L. Xie; G. Fan,2016,Organizational records systems: An alternative view to (enterprise) information systems,"The field of Information Systems (ISs) has been around since the 1960s (Hirschheim and Kleinand, 2011) and the notion of Enterprise Information Systems has been fully acknowledged for close to 30 years (Xu, 2007). Long existing in organizations or enterprises is also the field of records management, now predominantly, digital records management, which shares the many goals of the fields of ISs and EIS in terms of supporting enterprise operations and advancements. The DRM field recognized rather early in its battle to combat digital records challenges that the need to work closely with the ICT profession for devising information system functional requirements and for developing long term preservation strategies for valuable digital records. It is still rare, however, to spot discussions regarding the relationships among the fields in the ICT literature today. It is the intention of this communication piece to introduce one of the major developments of the international DRM field, i.e., the Chain of Preservation model, in particular the types of records systems that it encompasses, to the ISs and EIS professions, for the purpose of invoking further discussions and future collaborations.

S. Negri,2016,Simulating the past. Digital preservation of moving images and the ‘end of cinema’,"In the past decade, the discourse around digital cinema has flourished and given birth to a long series of ontological and phenomenological reflections around the status of the medium in the digital age. Can digital cinema still be called ‘cinema?’. Does cinema conserve its indexical nature, or is digital cinema just a simulation? What are the effects of the proliferation of screens, and the consequent loss of the centrality of movie theaters as the place for consumption of moving images? With my essay, I would like to investigate the status of digital preservation within the world of digital cinema. How is digital preservation different from analog preservation, if at all? And how are digitally restored moving images different from a film shot digitally? If a digital image is a simulation of reality, rather than a trace left by it (as the analog image supposedly was), what is the status of the digitization of an analog photographic image? I will argue that digital preservation forces us to reconsider the analog-digital opposition, and provides a framework through which to rethink not only the present state of cinema, but also its past and the future of its history. © 2016, Mimesis International.

The public workshop consisted of presentations by experts of disaster archives and a panel discussion. The wide-ranging backgrounds of these experts – anthropology, history and engineering – provided for a pioneering and interdisciplinary approach to the fields of disaster archives and memorialization. The aim of this workshop was to reflect on the potential roles of disaster archives and memorialization, with particular reference to the third priority for action – Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience – of the new UN-endorsed Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-30). Presentations covered several projects in digital archiving of disasters and research on memorialization processes of disasters. It was concluded that archiving and memorialization can, and should, play a complementary and significant role in disaster risk reduction. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press. All rights reserved."

S. Stefanova; T. Risch,2016,Scalable long-term preservation of relational data through SPARQL queries,"We present an approach for scalable long-term preservation of data stored in relational databases (RDBs) as RDF, implemented in the SAQ (Semantic Archive and Query) system. The proposed approach is suitable for archiving scientific data used in scientific publications where it is desirable to preserve only parts of an RDB, e.g. only data about a specific set of experimental artefacts in the database. With the approach, long-term preservation as RDF of selected parts of a database is specified as an archival query in an extended SPARQL dialect, A-SPARQL. The query processing is based on automatically generating an RDF view of a relational database to archive, called the RD-view. A-SPARQL provides flexible selection of data to be archived in terms of a SPARQL-like query to the RD-view. The result of an archival query is a data archive file containing the RDF-triples representing the relational data content to be preserved. The system also generates a schema archive file where sufficient meta-data are saved to allow the archived database to be fully reconstructed. An archival query usually selects both properties and their values for sets of subjects, which makes the property p in some triple patterns unknown. We call such queries where properties are unknown unbound-property queries. To achieve scalable data preservation and recreation, we propose some query transformation strategies suitable for optimizing unbound-property queries. These query rewriting strategies were implemented and evaluated in a new benchmark for archival queries called ABench. ABench is defined as set of typical A-SPARQL queries archiving selected parts of databases generated by the Berlin benchmark data generator. In experiments, the SAQ optimization strategies were evaluated by measuring the performance of A-SPARQL queries selecting triples for archival in ABench. The performance of equivalent SPARQL queries for related systems was also measured. The results showed that the proposed optimizations substantially improve the query execution time for archival queries. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved."
S.

This paper covers the multiple facets of digital archiving for a comprehensive understanding of Japanese activities and issues learnt since the 1990s, starting from the development of digital archives and related activities. It then discusses some issues for sustainable development of digital archives: social, usability, technological and longevity. As building and maintaining digital archives is expensive, it is important to demonstrate their value to ensure their sustainability. Continuous effort must be made to build really usable digital archives, and to develop appropriate measures to evaluate usability. Such effort must include human resource development and community networking. © 2016, The author."
S. Sugimoto; C. Li; M. Nagamori; J. Greenberg,2016,Permanence and temporal interoperability of metadata in the linked open data environment,"This paper examines metadata longevity issues in the Linked Open Data (LOD) environment, where metadata, as a digital object, is transferred and shared on the open Web. Longevity is key for achieving metadata permanence, which allows metadata to remain interpretable by machines and humans over time. The discussion presented in this paper seeks to clarify risks in permanence of metadata, by focusing on metadata longevity challenges specific to metadata and metadata schemas in the LOD environment. This examination addresses metadata longevity from several different viewpoints in order to clarify the requirements of metadata permanence in the LOD environment, and distinguish these needs from conventional document-like object environment or database-centric environment. A central theme in this work is that longevity of metadata is, in essence, the temporal interoperability of metadata. This paper uses the Metadata Application Profile methodology supported by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and DCMI's layered model of metadata interoperability to understand the nature of metadata in the LOD environment. Next, the paper discusses metadata longevity based on a set of facets of metadata entities such as metadata schemas; and the last part briefly discusses issues to use provenance description of metadata schemas and metadata schema registries from the viewpoint of long-term maintenance of metadata schemas."

Although it describes a local solution, the problems are global and relevant to all those involved in the management of archaeological resources. The chapter examines the staffing structure, which reflects the four main areas of activity: collections development, negotiating access to data and assisting data creators; preservation and standards, responsible for data validation, documentation and curation; collections delivery, maintaining and developing the Archaeology Data Service (ADS) delivery mechanisms; and user services, encouraging and assisting data reuse and resource discovery. Methodologies, procedures, and standards for digital preservation are now being developed, and there are exciting opportunities for breaking down the traditional distinctions between archives and publication. Digital data, in a variety of forms, increasingly constitute the primary record of archaeological investigations; grey literature often comprises the main form of publication.

T. Van Phan; K. Cong Nguyen; M. Nakagawa,2016,A Nom historical document recognition system for digital archiving,"A Nom historical document recognition system is being developed for digital archiving that uses image binarization, character segmentation, and character recognition. It incorporates two versions of off-line character recognition: one for automatic recognition of scanned and segmented character patterns (7660 categories) and the other for user handwritten input (32,695 categories). This separation is used since including less frequently appearing categories in automatic recognition increases the misrecognition rate without reliable statistics on the Nom language. Moreover, a user must be able to check the results and identify the correct categories from an extended set of categories, and a user can input characters by hand. Both versions use the same recognition method, but they are trained using different sets of training patterns. Recursive X–Y cut and Voronoi diagrams are used for segmentation; k–d tree and generalized learning vector quantization are used for coarse classification; and the modified quadratic discriminant function is used for fine classification. The system provides an interface through which a user can check the results, change binarization methods, rectify segmentation, and input correct character categories by hand. Evaluation done using a limited number of Nom historical documents after providing ground truths for them showed that the two stages of recognition along with user checking and correction improved the recognition results significantly. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
U. Preuss,2016,"Sustainable Digitalization of Cultural HeritageReport on Initiatives and Projects in Brandenburg, Germany","While digitalization opens up new possibilities for cultural heritage and tourism it also brings new challenges. Initiatives such as Europeana, an internet portal for cultural heritage within the European Union, support institutions with the display of their collections. National initiatives complement these efforts. This report describes initiatives and projects for generating and sustaining digital cultural heritage resources in the German state of Brandenburg. With the cultural heritage distributed throughout the state and managed by hundreds of institutions, the task of digitalization is a common challenge for all of these institutions. Digitalization and digital sustainability is limited by shortcomings in areas of human resources, knowledge and IT infrastructure. In light of these limitations, the cultural heritage community addresses challenges with an interdisciplinary approach. It is based on a collaborative model with four levels: (1) a statewide strategy of an interdisciplinary task force; (2) cooperative projects; (3) cooperative IT infrastructure; and (4) an overall coordination. The priorities are: (1) creating and displaying digital content; (2) establishing best practices and workflows; (3) developing cooperative infrastructures for sustainment. Since 2012, several projects have been implemented based on that collaborative model. More than 50 participating institutions benefited from cooperative planning, managing, digitizing and digital presentation. With regard to the third priority, the task force's next step is finding solutions for digital preservation. Considering the lack of funding and resources in the cultural heritage sector, options for creating and sustaining digital resources are limited. Digital cultural heritage requires interdisciplinary thinking, cooperative initiatives, reliable IT infrastructures and additional funding."

Austin,2016,A Digital Repository and Execution Platform for Interactive Scholarly Publications in Neuroscience,"The CARMEN Virtual Laboratory (VL) is a cloud-based platform which allows neuroscientists to store, share, develop, execute, reproduce and publicise their work. This paper describes new functionality in the CARMEN VL: an interactive publications repository. This new facility allows users to link data and software to publications. This enables other users to examine data and software associated with the publication and execute the associated software within the VL using the same data as the authors used in the publication. The cloud-based architecture and SaaS (Software as a Service) framework allows vast data sets to be uploaded and analysed using software services. Thus, this new interactive publications facility allows others to build on research results through reuse. This aligns with recent developments by funding agencies, institutions, and publishers with a move to open access research. Open access provides reproducibility and verification of research resources and results. Publications and their associated data and software will be assured of long-term preservation and curation in the repository. Further, analysing research data and the evaluations described in publications frequently requires a number of execution stages many of which are iterative. The VL provides a scientific workflow environment to combine software services into a processing tree. These workflows can also be associated with publications and executed by users. The VL also provides a secure environment where users can decide the access rights for each resource to ensure copyright and privacy restrictions are met. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."
V. L.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach involves using the requirements embedded in records management and digital preservation standards, specifically ISO 15,489, ARMA’s Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles, ISO 14,721 and ISO 16,363, as a general evaluative framework for a risk-based assessment of a specific proposed implementation of Blockchain technology for a land registry system in a developing country. Findings: The results of the analysis suggest that Blockchain technology can be used to address issues associated with information integrity in the present and near term, assuming proper security architecture and infrastructure management controls. It does not, however, guarantee reliability of information in the first place, and would have several limitations as a long-term solution for maintaining trustworthy digital records.

Alvarez,2016,One-click data analysis software for science operations,"One of the important activities of ESA Science Operations Centre is to convert raw data received from Mission spacecraft into science data. This is done through pipeline software that systematically processes data in batch mode generating high level products. Furthermore, the SOC also provides Data Analysis Software (DAS) to enable users and scientists to further process data in an interactive way. In both types of work, calibration data are required to describe how instruments perform. Calibration data are sometimes supplied separately. Another important activity is the Mission Science Archive that stores all Mission data, from raw to science data, plus all necessary auxiliary information. The Archive makes data available to the science community through Internet. Science Archives remain active well after a Mission has finished operations and ensure the long-term preservation of its data for decades. Mission Data Analysis Software is crucial to enable data to be understood and scientific results and refereed papers to be produced. DAS is developed by the SOC and others during the Mission and usually run on a specific technology stack (OS, compilers, libs, custom-made code…). Users download the Mission DAS from the web to install it on local computers together with all necessary additional libraries and calibration data, supplied separately. During Mission operations and post-operational phases, the DAS is fully maintained and updated for new OS and library releases. Nonetheless, once a Mission goes into the “legacy” phase, there are very limited funds to maintain DAS and through the years, as the IT world evolves, DAS slowly but inevitably becomes more and more difficult to install and run on modern computers. The main objective of the DAS Long Term Preservation project was therefore to study the feasibility of providing users with an easy access to Data Analysis Software (DAS) capabilities, independently of the mission’s phase. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

V. Roussev; S. McCulley,2016,Forensic analysis of cloud-native artifacts,"Forensic analysis of cloud artifacts is still in its infancy; current approaches overwhelming follow the traditional method of collecting artifacts on a client device. In this work, we introduce the concept of analyzing cloud-native digital artifacts-data objects that maintain the persistent state of web/SaaS applications. Unlike traditional applications, in which the persistent state takes the form of files in the local file system, web apps download the necessary state on the fly and leave no trace in local storage. Using Google Docs as a case study, we demonstrate that such artifacts can have a completely different structure-their state is often maintained in the form of a complete (or partial) log of user editing actions. Thus, the traditional approach of obtaining a snapshot in time of the state of the artifacts is inherently forensically deficient in that it ignores potentially critical information on the evolution of a document over time. Further, cloud-native artifacts have no standardized external representation, which raises questions with respect to their long-term preservation and interpretation. © 2016 The Authors.

V. Sanchez; F. Auli-Llinas; J. Serra-Sagrista,2016,Piecewise mapping in HEVC lossless intra-prediction coding,"The lossless intra-prediction coding modality of the High Efficiency Video Coding standard provides high coding performance while allowing frame-by-frame basis access to the coded data. This is of interest in many professional applications, such as medical imaging, automotive vision, and digital preservation in libraries and archives. Various improvements to lossless intra-prediction coding have been proposed recently, most of them based on sample-wise prediction using differential pulse code modulation (DPCM). Other recent proposals aim at further reducing the energy of intra-predicted residual blocks. However, the energy reduction achieved is frequently minimal due to the difficulty of correctly predicting the sign and magnitude of residual values. In this paper, we pursue a novel approach to this energy-reduction problem using piecewise mapping (PWM) functions. In particular, we analyze the range of values in residual blocks and apply accordingly a PWM function to map specific residual values to unique lower values. We encode the appropriate parameters associated with the PWM functions at the encoder, so that the corresponding inverse PWM functions at the decoder can map values back to the same residual values. These residual values are then used to reconstruct the original signal. This mapping is, therefore, reversible and introduces no losses. We evaluate the PWM functions on 4×4 residual blocks computed after DPCM-based prediction for lossless coding of a variety of camera-captured and screen content sequences. Evaluation results show that the PWM functions can attain the maximum bit-rate reductions of 5.54% and 28.33% for screen content material compared with DPCM-based and block-wise intra-prediction, respectively. Compared with intra-block copy, piecewise mapping can attain the maximum bit-rate reductions of 11.48% for a camera-captured material. © 1992-2012 IEEE."
V. Sloyan,2016,Born-digital archives at the Wellcome Library: appraisal and sensitivity review of two hard drives,"Abstract: Digital preservation has been an ongoing issue for the archival profession for many years, with research primarily being focused on long-term preservation and user access. Attention is now turning to the important middle stage: processing born-digital archives, which encompasses several key tasks such as appraisal, arrangement, description and sensitivity review. The Wellcome Library is developing scalable workflows for born-digital archival processing that deal effectively both with hybrid and purely born-digital archives. These workflows are being devised and tested using two hard drives deposited within the archives of two genomic researchers, Ian Dunham and Michael Ashburner. This paper examines two specific and interconnected stages of archival processing: appraisal and sensitivity review. It sets out the Wellcome Library’s approach to appraisal using a combination of several appraisal methods, namely functional, technical and ‘bottom-up’ appraisal. It also demonstrates how tools such as DROID can be used to streamline the process. The paper then goes on to explore the Wellcome Library’s risk management-based approach to the sensitivity review of born-digital material, suggesting there is a viable balance to be struck between closing large record series as a precaution and sensitivity reviewing at a very granular level. © 2016 The Author(s).

Particularly, this paper focuses on the 3D visual and geometrical approach applied to epigraphic studies. The chosen case-study is a highly and fragmented inscription and scholars debate on its interpretation. Our analysis, performed on the 3D model acquired and based on computer vision methods wants to help scholars to analyse, interpret and reconstruct damaged inscriptions, where the letters' interpretation cannot be firmly based solely on the geometry of the carved surface, as well as investigate through 3D methodology the production of the inscriptions. © Archaeopress and the individual authors 2016.

The long-term management of personal information","People are amassing large personal information stores. These stores present rich opportunities for analysis and use in matters of wealth, health, living and legacy. But these stores also bring with them new challenges for managing information across long periods of time. Hence personal information management (PIM) research increasingly must address the long term. For the seventh PIM workshop in a successful series started in 2005, we propose taking a look at personal information with exactly this longitudinal perspective. We expect the workshop to attract a range of people doing research related to PIM, HCI, personal digital archiving, aging, and the design of informational spaces for later life. Attendees will discuss issues related to storing information for the long run, how stored information can benefit a person throughout their lifetime (and into old age), and the legacy of a person's personal information. © 2016 Authors."

To address this, an unprecedented digital library service is presented to enable the High-Energy Physics community to preserve and share their research objects (such as data, code, documentation, notes) throughout their research process. While facing the challenges of; “big data” community, the internal service builds on existing internal databases to make the process as easy and intrinsic as possible for researchers. Given the “work in progress” nature of the objects preserved, versioning is supported. It is expected that the service will not only facilitate better preservation techniques in the community, but will foremost make collaborative research easier as detailed metadata and novel retrieval functionality provide better access to ongoing works. This new type of e-infrastructure, fully integrated into the research workflow, could help in fostering Open Science practices across disciplines. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."

In addition, this social media collection comprising data from Twitter, Facebook and Vine was distributed to organizations and researchers to explore and investigate. In this paper, we present our initial observations on the first social media presidency through the lens of its data, extracted from their native platforms. While the data speak to the engagement cultivated by the administration in its use of social media, the collection contains as many questions as it does answers. The completeness, metadata and accessibility of these materials remain unclear, potentially limiting the use of the collections in research and beyond.

A. Miller,2017,A case study in institutional repository content curation: A collaborative partner approach to preserving and sustaining digital scholarship,"Purpose: The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how a university library collaborated with a specific college to preserve scholarship with a sustainable approach. The practical process described is recommended for increasing content submissions in a newly established institutional repository. Of the eight colleges at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU), the Honors College was selected as a case study for a library–college collaboration on content curation for the institutional repository that is maintained by MTSU’s Walker Library. Design/methodology/approach: Concept of shared and divided responsibilities for the upload, maintenance and sustainability of institutional repository submissions based on a particular case study and aided with literature on data management, digital publishing, library publishing and preservation research. Findings: The partner approach, the sharing and division of responsibilities, is instrumental to the growth and sustainability of a library publishing program and for the preservation of university scholarship. Practical implications: The (college) partner approach not only educates campus units about a new resource (e.g. institutional repository), but also encourages campus units to rethink other current and outdated practices that need to adapt to technological changes that support the unit and its students. This approach will help the library with campus outreach after an institutional repository is implemented and offers guidance on a collaborative approach to repository submission growth. Originality/value: This paper suggests a (college) partner approach that mutually benefits the College and its students, departments and the library that maintains the institutional repository on behalf of the university.

A. S. Harvey; G. Fotopoulos; B. Hall; K. Amolins,2017,Augmenting comprehension of geological relationships by integrating 3D laser scanned hand samples within a GIS environment,"Geological observations can be made on multiple scales, including micro- (e.g. thin section), meso- (e.g. hand-sized to outcrop) and macro- (e.g. outcrop and larger) scales. Types of meso-scale samples include, but are not limited to, rocks (including drill cores), minerals, and fossils. The spatial relationship among samples paired with physical (e.g. granulometric composition, density, roughness) and chemical (e.g. mineralogical and isotopic composition) properties can aid in interpreting geological settings, such as paleo-environmental and formational conditions as well as geomorphological history. Field samples are collected along traverses in the area of interest based on characteristic representativeness of a region, predetermined rate of sampling, and/or uniqueness. The location of a sample can provide relative context in seeking out additional key samples. Beyond labelling and recording of geospatial coordinates for samples, further analysis of physical and chemical properties may be conducted in the field and laboratory. The main motivation for this paper is to present a workflow for the digital preservation of samples (via 3D laser scanning) paired with the development of cyber infrastructure, which offers geoscientists and engineers the opportunity to access an increasingly diverse worldwide collection of digital Earth materials. This paper describes a Web-based graphical user interface developed using Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS for digitized meso-scale 3D scans of geological samples to be viewed alongside the macro-scale environment. Over 100 samples of virtual rocks, minerals and fossils populate the developed geological database and are linked explicitly with their associated attributes, characteristic properties, and location. Applications of this new Web-based geological visualization paradigm in the geosciences demonstrate the utility of such a tool in an age of increasing global data sharing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Design/methodology/approach: This is a case study that uses literature review as an exploratory framework for new approaches while reflecting on existing literature to present the current practical framework for using IRs. Findings: The digital environment has pushed academic institutions toward new strategies for curating their record on scholarship and preserving their heritage collections, using their IRs. Innovative approaches are also vital to curating the IR content digitally to facilitate access to those contents in ways that was not possible a few decades ago. Surveys and existing literature point to increasing uses of IRs despite abstinence from considering open access for scholarly activity among faculty concerned about copyright, plagiarism and sustainability. Staffing and funding IR initiatives are important factors in sustaining the curation of scholarship in the digital environment. Practical implications: IRs with open access publishing, expert gallery and digital library features place academic libraries in a central role as partners in digital scholarship. Originality/value: This case study presents an original approach to incorporating the IR into the curation of digital content while also considering potential uses of knowledge management approaches for data and knowledge sharing in an academic environment. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

C. J. Nwabueze,2017,Copyright and data authenticity in the digital preservation of heritage: The case of OAPI,"Digitisation is a sustainable means of heritage1 preservation. It protects valuable heritage resources from deterioration and provides worldwide access to the diverse cultures of the world's heritage, while ensuring their safety for future generations. Digitised heritage can derive either from digitally created documents or from digital surrogates of similar documents. In OAPI States, ministries in the field of culture, substitute and for, tourism and several cultural institutions have adopted digital heritage as a tool for safeguarding the communities' cultural patrimony. Data authenticity in heritage digitisation raises some concerns based on the fact that digitisation as a tool to express the content of heritage products affects the entire spectrum of heritage preservation. Issues arise from the multiple applications of digital technologies on the heritage data used. From converting the data used, to processing it with a different shape, character or design, there is a long list of ways in which the authenticity of a digitised heritage work could be affected. Digital technologies could negatively affect the information environment by allowing the processing of inauthentic data. In this context, Mira Burri describes the process of the digital reduction of material to zeroes and ones through which the digital representation radically modifies the characteristics of the content. One click of the mouse can create perfect copies, transform, alter, or create multifaceted adaptations of the heritage data; this constitutes a tremendous threat to the data's authenticity. If no appropriate legal boundaries are set, this invasive tsunami of new possibilities could deceive the public about the authenticity of heritage data from OAPI communities. This paper gives a pictorial overview of traditional cultural expressions in central and West Africa and scrutinises the sustainability of copyright as a means to enhance the authenticity of heritage data in the course of its preservation in the digital realm. First, this paper analyses the authenticity of heritage data under 'moral rights' protection in the digital field. Light is shed on the risks related to the digitisation of heritage when no proper intellectual property measures regarding the origin of the work in the digital realm are in place. Then, the paper considers how adequate digital copyright protection could constitute a way to protect the authenticity of digital heritage and encourage the use of digitalisation in the preservation of cultural heritage in general. The paper concludes by making some suggestions about how to balance the risks of digitising heritage in a global world. An adequate system of copyright law could make use of the new dynamics of the digitally networked environment to promote the authenticity of heritage, and also to promote the mobilisation of cultural heritage through the use of digital technologies. Finally, the establishment of a protocol for the digitisation of heritage - with the goal of preserving authenticity - is envisaged as a means to serve the same purpose."

C. M. Chen; M. Y. Tsay,2017,"Applications of collaborative annotation system in digital curation, crowdsourcing, and digital humanities","Purpose-Collaboratively annotating digital texts allow users to add valued information, share ideas and create knowledge. Most importantly, annotated content can help users obtain a deeper and broader understanding of a text compared to digital content without annotations. This work proposes a novel collaborative annotation system (CAS) with four types of multimedia annotations including text annotation, picture annotation, voice annotation and video annotation which can embedded into any HTML Web pages to enable users to collaboratively add and manage annotations on these pages and provide a shared mechanism for discussing shared annotations among multiple users. By applying the CAS in a mashup on static HTML Web pages, this study aims to discuss the applications of CAS in digital curation, crowdsourcing and digital humanities to encourage existing strong relations among them. Design/methodology/approach-This work adopted asynchronous JavaScript (Ajax) and a model-viewcontroller framework to implement a CAS with reading annotation tools for knowledge creating, archiving and sharing services, as well as applying the implemented CAS to support digital curation, crowdsourcing and digital humanities. A questionnaire survey method was used to investigate the ideas and satisfaction of visitors who attended a digital curation with CAS support in the item dimensions of the interactivity with displayed products, the attraction and the content absorption effect. Also, to collect qualitative data that may not be revealed by the questionnaire survey, semi-structured interviews were performed at the end of the digital curation exhibition activity. Additionally, the effects of the crowdsourcing and digital humanities with CAS support on collecting and organizing ideas and opinions for historical events and promoting humanity research outcomes were considered as future works because they all need to take a long time to investigate. Findings-Based on the questionnaire survey, this work found that the digital curation with CAS support revealed the highest rating score in terms of the item dimension of attraction effect. The result shows applying CAS to support digital curation is practicable, novel and interesting to visitors. Additionally, this work also successfully applied the developed CAS to crowdsourcing and digital humanities so that the two research fields may be brought into a new ground. Originality/value-Based on the CAS, this work developed a novel digital curation approach which has a high degree of satisfaction on attraction effect to visitors, an innovative crowdsourcing platform that combined with a digital archive system to efficiently gather collective intelligence to solve the difficult problems of identifying digital archive contents and a high potential digital humanity research mode that can assist humanities scholars to annotate the texts with distinct interpretation and viewpoints on an ancient map, as well as discuss with other humanities scholars to stimulate discussion onmore issues. © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds case studies of seven new media artists of differing practices and artistic approaches. For each case study, semi-structured interviews with the artists were conducted in conjunction with visits to the artists’ studios. Findings: The study finds that new media artists face a number of shared preservation challenges and employ a range of preservation strategies, and that these challenges and strategies differ markedly from that of art museums and cultural heritage institutions. Research limitations/implications: This study considers preservation practices for new media artists generally. Further research into specific communities of artistic practice could profitably build upon this overall framework. Practical implications: The findings of this research pose a number of implications for art museums and cultural heritage institutions, suggesting new ways these institutions might consider supporting the preservation of new media artworks before works enter into institutional custody. Originality/value: The literature on new media art preservation emphasizes the importance of working with artists early in the life cycle of digital artworks. This study advances this by investigating preservation from the perspective of new media artists, deepening the understanding of challenges and potential preservation strategies for these artworks prior to entering or outside of institutional custody. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
C. Pramartha; J. G. Davis; K. K. Y. Kuan,2017,Digital preservation of cultural heritage: An ontology-based approach,"The project aims to design and build a digital portal which will document, organise, and preserve aspects of Balinese cultural heritage and related knowledge for the benefit of the wider community and the younger generations in particular. We present the details of our research dealing with one aspect of Balinese culture, the Balinese traditional communication system (kulkul), undertaken in the Indonesian island of Bali. This knowledge is held largely in tacit form in the Balinese community and tends to be poorly documented and fragmented. A basic ontology of key kulkul-related concepts and terms and their interrelationships was developed to support the semantic searching and browsing of the online portal and related resources. Much of the content for the portal was acquired through community-based crowdsourcing. We also discuss the procedures employed evaluate the digital portal prototype. © ACIS 2017."
C. Stanley; D. G. Cabrero; H. Winschiers-Theophilus; E. Blake,2017,Challenges in designing cultural heritage crowdsourcing: Tools with indigenous communities,"Digital preservation of palpable and intangible cultural heritage, including the curation and re-contextualisation of Indigenous Knowledge (IK), has lately gained great prominence, especially in an era where new technologies offer enhanced User Experiences (UXs) such as augmented and virtual realities. Practices in cultural heritage collection have moreover shifted towards greater community and citizen involvements, thereby opening-up a myriad of perspectives and sources, which eventually allow for differently depicted narratives and voiced viewpoints. Besides a number of conceptual and practical benefits, the complexity of such a movement is reflected in the challenges encountered in the design and use of technological systems supporting such heritage-gathering processes. As such crowdsourcing platforms have been developed and deployed to support diverse stages of cultural heritage practices. Among others they facilitate open calls to a crowd which are asked to perform specific tasks, such as uploading stories, photos, validating historic accounts, etc. From a literature and case study analysis Noordegraaf et al., (2014) derived a number of conditions for crowdsourcing designs, which directly implicate the success or failure of organic preservation projects such as the Red een Portret (Save a Portrait) and photo-tagging the Vele Handen (Many Hands). Moreover, an adequate alignment of workflow, communication, motivation, and targeting strategies has directly affected the recruitment and retention of “the crowd”, thereby implicitly directing account and outcomes obtained. A well-known example of this is the Wikipedia platform, which, having attracted only a homogenous group of editors in its aim to capturing “all human knowledge”, has thereby created a systemic, westernised bias in the portrayal and representation of knowledge (Gallert and van der Velden, 2015). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Luigina Ciolfi, Areti Damala, Eva Hornecker, Monika Lechner and Laura Maye; individual chapters, the contributors."

The objective of veraPDF is to build an industry supported, open source validator for all parts and conformance levels of the PDF/A specification for archival PDF documents. The project is led by the Open Preservation Foundation and the PDF Association and is funded by the EU PREFORMA project. Design/methodology/approach: veraPDF is designed to meet the needs of the digital preservation community and the PDF industry alike. The technology is subject to the review of and acceptance by the PDF Association’s PDF Validation Technical Working Group, including many participants of the relevant ISO working groups. Cultural heritage institutions are collecting ever-increasing volumes of digital information, which they have a mandate to preserve for the long term. However, in many cases, they need to ensure their content has been produced to the specifications of a standard file format, as well as any acceptance criteria stated in their institutional policy. Findings: With increasing knowledge and experience of processes and policies, cultural heritage institutions are influencing the production and development of digital preservation software. The product development funded by the PREFORMA project shows how such cooperation can benefit the community as a whole.

D. Formenton; F. F. De Castro; L. De Souza Gracioso; A. C. M. Furnival; M. Da Graça De Melo Simões,2017,Metadata standards as a technological resource to guarantee digital preservation,"The guarantee of long-term digital preservation will only be possible with the effective implementation of metadata standards or schemas, because these will determine the description, representation, consistency and persistence of the digital resource/object in information environments, as well as defining interoperability between systems. The adoption of metadata for preservation supports the management of processes for the archiving and maintenance of access to digital information in the long term, guaranteeing authenticity, integrity and reliability. In this scenario, the aim of this study was to identify and describe metadata standards or schemas that could be considered by institutions that are developing their institutional repositories, so that digital preservation might be addressed. To that end, a literature review, and its systematization and content analysis were carried out. The following metadata standards and schemas were selected and analyzed: Dublin CORE (DC), MODS, EAD, ANSI/NISO Z39.87, METS and PREMIS. The results indicate that the descriptive and technical metadata DC, MODS, EAD and ANSI/NISO Z39.87 or MIX have a role that is more directed to supporting METS and PREMIS, both in discovering and recording the technical aspects of digital objects, and in the proof of its provenance, authenticity, context and integrity. Encompassing descriptive, structural, administrative and preservation metadata of PREMIS, METS can manage digital objects acting as a Submission Information Package (SIP), Archival Information Package (AIP) or Dissemination Information Package (DIP) in an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)."

D. Reside,2017,The Advantages of floating in the middle of the sea: Digital musical theatre research,"There has been much anxiety over the last decade about the effect the increasing dependence on digital tools in all art forms will have on the historical memory of this present moment. Chapter 11 discusses how the typescripts, film negatives, and telegrams that tell the story of the theatre of a generation or two ago have been replaced by Google Docs, JPEGs, and posts on Facebook walls. Today, much of the history of Broadway is stored on a variety of digital storage devices, some owned by corporations with little incentive to invest in long-term preservation. Libraries and archives must figure out how to preserve this content, but researchers must also figure out how to use it. Born-digital archives are as varied as their traditional analog counterparts, and it is clear that these collections provide new and more complete ways of understanding the individual’s creative process: reconstructing productions, discovering hidden social networks, and comparing interpretations of texts in performance. © The Author(s) 2017."
D. S. H. Rosenthal,2017,The medium-term prospects for long-term storage systems,"Purpose: Increasingly, the content that libraries collect is no longer on paper, a long-lived, medium whose technology changes very slowly and with which they have centuries of experience. Instead, it is stored on relatively short-lived digital media whose technology appears to change rapidly and with which they have little history. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The storage media industry is highly competitive and is currently evolving rapidly as flash, a solid state medium, displaces spinning disk from many applications. Long-term archival storage is a small part of the total storage market. It typically re-uses media and systems intended for more general bulk storage. Findings: What are the medium-term prospects for change in this market?

D. Sinn; S. Kim; S. Y. Syn,2017,Personal digital archiving: influencing factors and challenges to practices,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the associations of personal archiving behaviors to factors and challenges that have been assumed to affect personal digital archiving strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study created an online survey to understand general patterns of personal digital archiving practices and related phenomena. The survey was employed to investigate to what extent people show a certain behavior or feel certain factors and challenge when archiving personal digital content. Findings: Some of the findings of this study regarding specific personal digital archiving practices were in accordance with existing studies. However, the associations between digital archiving challenges and archiving practices were not observed statistically significantly as assumed in previous studies. General technology efficacy and the awareness of the importance of personal records appeared to influence personal archiving practices. Research limitations/implications: This study used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. As this is not a commonly used internet service, the workers here could have higher than average levels of internet efficacy. This possibility may have affected the demographics, and the survey responses may be biased in this respect. Practical implications: As the study results suggest that technology efficacy and personal heritage awareness are the influencing factors of personal digital archiving, these are the areas where information professionals can involve in assisting users for future cultural heritage. Originality/value: This is the first study that develops measures for personal digital archiving related practices and perceptions that the previous qualitative studies have identified. With these measures, it examines the general status of individuals’ archiving strategies and the overall associations of digital archiving challenges as well as looking into other technological and personal factors. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

E. Boamah; C. L. Liew,2017,Conceptualising the digitisation and preservation of indigenous knowledge: The importance of attitudes,"In this paper, we discuss factors that influence the digitisation of cultural heritage resources and outline differences in the challenges faced by memory institutions in developed and developing countries. Increasingly, memory institutions (galleries, libraries, archives and museum) are taking advantage of digital technologies, including social Web technologies to digitise, share and preserve heritage resources to create national repositories with the hope of eliminating gaps in future memory. They also seek opportunities to engage with and involve owners of cultural heritage resources and key stakeholders in the digitisation of their heritage collections. Nevertheless, memory institutions have faced various challenges in doing so. In developed countries, memory institutions are mainly challenged by how to navigate the enormity of the collections that need to be digitised and preserved. In developing countries, different forms of negative attitudes towards digitisation hinder progress in digital preservation management. Owners of cultural heritage resources fear permanent loss of their heritage, key stakeholders lack interest in heritage digitisation, and information professionals have conflicting ideas on how to go about the digitisation process. Our analysis reveals attitudinal issues can have a significant impact on digital preservation. Even though attitudinal issues have been mentioned in previous studies, they are often treated more at an implicit level. We argue that in the context of cultural heritage digitising and preserving involving source communities and various stakeholders, the attitudinal dimension ought to be a key consideration and as such, should be made explicit in discussion of these. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."
E. Maemura; N. Moles; C. Becker,2017,Organizational assessment frameworks for digital preservation: A literature review and mapping,"As the field of digital preservation (DP) matures, there is an increasing need to systematically assess an organization's abilities to achieve its digital preservation goals, and a wide variety of assessment tools have been created for this purpose. This article aims to map the landscape of research in this area, evaluate the current maturity of knowledge on this central question in DP and provide direction for future research. To do so, this paper reviews assessment frameworks in digital preservation through a systematic literature search and categorizes the literature by type of research. The analysis shows that publication output around assessment in digital preservation has increased markedly over time, but most existing work focuses on developing new models rather than rigorous evaluation and validation of existing frameworks. Significant gaps are present in the application of robust conceptual foundations and design methods, and in the level of empirical evidence available to enable the evaluation and validation of assessment models. The analysis and comparison with other fields suggest that the design of assessment models in DP should be studied rigorously in both theory and practice, and that the development of future models will benefit from applying existing methods, processes, and principles for model design. © 2017 ASIS&T"

E. Weiskott,2017,Multispectral imaging and medieval manuscripts,"Debates in the field of manuscript studies often take the form of disputes over material details that are at least theoretically quantifiable. Until recently, such debates were adjudicated entirely on the basis of comparison by human eye. Paleographical and codicological research along these lines has been transformative: it remains the edifice on which rest all other forms of knowledge about medieval texts. Recently, it has become possible to supplement the human eye with a digital one. This essay outlines the scope and goals of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science, manuscript studies, and cultural heritage preservation.

F. M. Granja; G. D. R. Rafael,2017,The preservation of digital evidence and its admissibility in the court,"This article's objective is to screen and analyse the common models of digital preservation that exist, the elements, the degree of compliance with the general guidelines, the use of techniques and compliance with specific requirements as well as to evaluate the need for a solution to the environment of criminal investigation institutions, in the scenario that lacks a specific model. The importance of the preservation of digital objects is currently heavily analysed. Several aspects may serve to make the digital objects worthless, such as the uselessness of hardware, the deficiency of ancient computing formats to support their use, human errors and malicious software. The majority of crimes currently have a digital component, such that governments and the police are obliged by law to indefinitely hold digital evidence for a case's history. Until the presentation of the digital evidence in court, the evidence must be collected, preserved and properly distributed. The systems currently used often involve multiple steps that do not meet the demands of the growing digital world. The volume of digital evidence continues to grow, and these steps will soon become operationally and economically unfeasible for agencies responsible for performing these tasks.

F. Peter; B. Andrea; K. Aeneas; R. Lukas,2017,Enhanced RTI for gloss reproduction,"The Digital Humanities Lab (DHLab) is a technological oriented research group within the faculty of Humanities of the University of Basel. The research profile of the DHLab integrates computer science, digital imaging, computational photography, the accessibility of digital objects and solutions for digital preservation with the aim to support scholars in the emerging field of humanities research. The project Digital Materiality, a collaboration with the Seminar of Art History, examines how new imaging and visualization methods can be applied to describe the reflection of light on surfaces of artworks. Of main interest are mosaics and early prints; both types of artworks have a strong interaction with light that can not captured adequately by standard photographic approaches. Conventional photographic processes are not able to capture the dynamic component of the light-surface interdependence that is specific for this kind of art. The technical part of the project focuses on improving the methodology that is in general described as Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) techniques. RTI is an approach based on a mathematical model, that is fitted in image data derived from photographs. By modifying the mathematical model that is used to represent the light-surface interaction, the digital reproduction can be improved so that relevant attributes of artworks can be transported into the digital domain in such a way that the requirements and needs of humanities researchers to a digital representation can be fulfilled. The improvements take into account more sophisticated but still robust and simple reflection models for the realistic visualization of localized diffuse and specular surfaces within the same digital reproduction. For humanities research the most important aspect is the compatibility to web-based Virtual Research Environments (VRE). The presented approach can be integrated in such environments because the client-side visualization is implemented in WebGL. For flexibility, performance and data permanence aspects the server side will be an enhanced image server layer following the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) image based environment. © 2017, Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

Inter-organizational collaboration on e-government can appear in several forms and can aim at varying types of benefits. However, few if any studies have delved deeper into analysis of how chosen forms of collaboration might relate to targeted e-government benefits. This article studies five cases of how contemporary acquisitions and implementations of digital archiving systems have been launched through five modes of collaboration (autonomous, standardization, framework agreement, consortium, and central service organization) among organizations in the Swedish public sector. Our analysis reveals that whereas the target system, digital archive in our case, stays similar, expected benefits vary. The article contributes by elaborating the concept of mode of collaboration that identifies typical benefits justifying a choice of a particular collaboration form on e-government development and describing the five modes in more detail based on a multi-case study. The article also outlines fourteen related propositions of the correlation between the collaboration modes and expected benefits to be verified by further research. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."
G. Płoszajski,2017,Metadata in long-term digital preservation,"Metadata has been used to describe digital data for several years. First metadata standards were created in the nineties. Particularly important proved to be Dublin Core designed for the description of web-based resources (1995). At the same time Exif standard was created, determining mainly technical metadata used to describe parameters of digital images and information on equipment used. Since that time various other types of metadata have been created, e.g. rights metadata, provenance, structural, and many domain-oriented standards. Long-term digital archives usually preserve all metadata transferred to them with corresponding digital objects and often use a subset of obtained metadata to manage archive assets. They also create preservation metadata, which describe processes and preservation actions applied to digital objects in the archives. In this chapter basic information about metadata in long-term digital archives is given. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."

In the context of a research and technology transfer project on Digital Curation Technologies for online content we develop a platform that provides curation services that can be integrated into concrete curation or content management systems. In this project, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) collaborates with four Berlin-based SMEs that work with and on digital content in four different sectors. The curation services comprise several semantic text and document analytics processes as well as knowledge technologies that can be applied to document collections. The key objective of this set of curation services is to support knowledge workers and digital curators in their daily work, i.e., to automate or to semi-automate processes that the human experts are normally required to do intellectually and without tool support. The goal is to help this group of information and knowledge workers to become more efficient and more effective as well as to enable them to produce high-quality content in their respective sectors. In this article we concentrate on the current state of a user interface that is currently under development at ART+COM, one of the SME partners in the project. A second, more generic, i.e., not domain-specific user interface is under development at DFKI. In this article we describe the technology platform and the two different interfaces.

G. Tang,2017,Sex in the archives: The politics of processing and preserving pornography in the digital age,"By synthesizing perspectives from both archival theory and porn studies, this article relates archives, pornography, and technology to reveal the growing complexities of processing sexually explicit materials in the archives. Amid canonical discussions of privacy/access for physical (personal) documents, the digitization of visual records, and shifting ideas of permanence (in part due to new tools for preservation), archivists must address the problems in preservation and access posed by digital records themselves. How will both analog and contemporary born-digital (e.g., Internetbased) pornographies be processed given the stigmas and metadata issues surrounding sexually explicit materials in the archives? These problems are all the more complicated by new theories of digital preservation"" and conceptualizations of the Internet as a (faux) ""archive."" As such, archives and archivists are left to negotiate the politics of what is ""appropriate"" content for the public-balancing outreach programs, educational initiatives, and grant-seeking with representation in and diversification of their collections. Rather than propose solutions for an unforeseen future in archival practice, the author interrogates current issues affecting the preservation of pornography in tandem with the advent of new technologies (e.g., the unfurling realities of digitization initiatives and cyberporn). The author intends to encourage further discussion and planning initiatives to account for these issues. © 2017 GVGK Tang."""
H. Francke; J. Gamalielsson; B. Lundell,2017,Institutional repositories as infrastructures for long-term preservation,"Introduction. The study describes the conditions for long-term preservation of the content of the institutional repositories of Swedish higher education institutions based on an investigation of how deposited files are managed with regards to file format and how representatives of the repositories describe the functions of the repositories. Method. The findings are based on answers to a questionnaire completed by thirty-four institutional repository representatives (97% response rate). Analysis. Questionnaire answers were analysed through descriptive statistics and qualitative coding. The concept of information infrastructures was used to analytically discuss repository work. Results. Visibility and access to content were considered to be the most important functions of the repositories, but long-term preservation was also considered important for publications and student theses. Whereas a majority of repositories had some form of guidelines for which file formats were accepted, very few considered whether or not file formats constitute open standards. This can have consequences for the long-term sustainability and access of the content deposited in the repositories. Conclusion. The study contributes to the discussion about the sustainability of research publications and data in the repositories by pointing to the potential difficulties involved for long-term preservation and access when there is little focus on and awareness of open file formats. © the authors, 2017."
H. Holzmann; W. Nejdl; A. Anand,2017,Exploring web archives through temporal anchor texts,"Web archives have been instrumental in digital preservation of the Web and provide great opportunity for the study of the societal past and evolution. These Web archives are massive collections, typically in the order of terabytes and petabytes. Due to this, search and exploration of archives has been limited as full-text indexing is both resource and computationally expensive. We identify that for typical access methods to archives, which are navigational and temporal in nature, we do not always require indexing full-text. Instead, meaningful text surrogates like anchor texts already go a long way in providing meaningful solutions and can act as reasonable entry points to exploring Web archives. In this paper, we present a new approach to searching Web archives based on temporal link graphs and corresponding anchor texts. Departing from traditional informational intents, we show how temporal anchor texts can be effective in answering queries beyond purely navigational intents, like finding the most central webpages of an entity in a given time period. We propose indexing methods and a temporal retrieval model based on anchor texts. Further, we discuss several interesting search results as well as one experiment in which we demonstrate how such results can be integrated in a data processing workflow to scale up to thousands of pages. In this analysis we were able to replicate results reported by an offline study, showing that restaurant prices indeed increased in Germany when the Euro was introduced as Europe's currency. © 2017 ACM."
H. Moulaison Sandy; E. M. Corrado; B. B. Ivester,2017,Personal digital archiving: an analysis of URLs in the.edu domain,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to consider personal digital archiving (PDA) from an academic perspective. Although elements of research data management and personal information management are relevant, it is unclear what is available on university websites supporting PDA. The following question guided the research: where is “PDA” content housed in the top-level.edu domain and what is the format and nature of the content made available? Design/methodology/approach: This descriptive study analyzed Google hits yielded by searching “PDA” within the.edu domain. Results were analyzed to determine where content was housed and its format and nature. Placement in the domain, delivery methods, topics, and the nature of the most highly ranking Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) were analyzed. Findings: In the academy, PDA is not exclusively of interest in libraries; not quite half of the.edu URLs (45 percent) pointed to a library site. Scholarly papers were the most returned content, followed by blogs and conferences information. Closer analysis of the top 20 URLs showed that libraries are popular and papers, and blogs continue to be dominant. Research limitations/implications: The results suggest good PDA practices and recommendations are evolving. Academic librarians should examine these practices, refine them, and make them available and discoverable on the web. Originality/value: This is the first paper, to the knowledge, to consider PDA content from the perspective of universities and university libraries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
I. Beard,2017,The eBethArké Syriac digital library: a case study,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review and describe the teamwork, collaboration and learning experiences involved in meeting the unique challenges of establishing a new digital library for Syriac collections. The eBetharké Syriac Digital Library Portal is a collaborative effort between the libraries at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and the Beth Mardutho Syriac Institute, a traditional library of texts, to create a specialized digital library collection online. This digital library features content in and relating to Syriac, an Aramaic dialect spoken in the first century A.D. and for which a great deal of historically significant documents was written during the period. Design/methodology/approach: This task required effort and research on multiple fronts, including software development; collaboration on technical, interpersonal and policy-based levels; and in overcoming challenges related to the predominant computing platforms installed and in use by potential users of this digital library. Findings: This collaboration provided significant new challenges and learning experiences among the staff who worked on this project and provides a base upon which our digital library platforms can diversify and be more culturally aware. Social implications: There have been increasing calls within the academic community for better support in the technological space for this and other contemporary languages of the region. Creation of such a platform and expanding it significantly would benefit scholars of Middle Eastern texts in much the same way digital repositories have revolutionized online text access for the Western world. Originality/value: The project is unique in that it is believed to the first production-level, digital preservation-specific Syriac digital library of its kind. It supports the display of metadata and descriptive details for digital library objects not just in English, but in Arabic and Syriac languages as well, where appropriate © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
I. Lamata Martínez; M. S. Williams; S. Dyke; M. Krötzsch; P. Pegon,2017,Next directions in experimental data for seismic hazard mitigation,"Data are one of the main assets of earthquake engineering. Laboratory experiments can be extremely expensive and time consuming to replicate and, therefore, long-term preservation of experimental data and sharing the data with users has become one of the disciplinary priorities. There is a growing demand for international partnerships, which creates a need for data sharing, in an attempt to maximise research impact and to tackle experimental set-ups that could not be realised otherwise. However, there is a patent lack of interoperability between the institutions forming the earthquake engineering community, which inhibits efficient collaboration between them. In this paper, we discuss a vision about the directions that experimental data should take in the coming years, focusing on two aspects: enhanced international collaborations and implementation of open data access. We also describe the progress that has been made towards this vision, by establishing an open platform for the integration of earthquake hazard mitigation resources called Celestina. Celestina is supported by Semantic Web technologies, and uses an ontology as its integration data model. A prototype of the platform has been developed and tested between NEES (Purdue University, in the US), the University of Oxford (in UK) and EUCENTRE (in Italy), and a small proof of concept has enabled integrated experimental data from Oxford and EUCENTRE through the NEES cyberenvironment. This demonstration provides an example which has the potential to catalyze a new generation of research progress enabled by international data sharing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

J. A. Raemy; P. Fornaro; L. Rosenthaler,2017,Implementing a video framework based on IIIF: A customized approach from long-term preservation video formats to conversion on demand,"This paper addresses the issue of elaborating a structure for digital video assets based on the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) concepts for the use in archival environments. With a view to tailoring a solution to fit the end user’s needs, the dissemination copies of video material could be automatically converted on demand from their master files. Such a reduced data structure simplifies access to digital video sources but leads as well to simplified preservation due to reduced data volume and data complexity. Dissemination copies do not require specific dispositions for digital archiving anymore. Memory institutions would greatly benefit from a technology that can be integrated into a Web-based infrastructure. In such a way video content can for example be embedded into flexible Virtual Research Environments which allow scholars to work and cite more accurately video resources using IIIF. © 2017; Society for Imaging Science and Technology."

Ide-Ektessabi,2017,Visualization of subsurface features in oil paintings using high-resolution visible and near infrared scanned images,"High-resolution imaging is on the rise in the field of digital archiving of cultural heritage. Conventionally, this is accomplished by capturing images in the visible region. However, the visible region has a very narrow spectrum. In this study, around 100 oil paintings belonging to the Bridgestone Museum of Art in Tokyo, Japan have been digitized at both visible and near infrared region (i.e. ~400–700 nm and ~850 nm respectively) at 1000 dpi scanning resolution. Since materials behave differently when irradiated by a source with different wavelengths, the resulting images from visible and near infrared scans could reveal some under-drawings which are not visible from the naked eye. By applying false color image composition, it was possible to visualize subsurface features more easily. Different false color images were investigated by substituting the individual RGB channels of the visible images with NIR image to increase the optical contrast.

J. D. Richards,2017,Twenty Years Preserving Data A View from the United Kingdom,"In 2016 the Archaeology Data Service (ADS) was 20 years old. Since its birth the ADS has had to respond to rapid changes in technology, as well as major cultural and organizational changes in the external operating environment, from which a sustainable business model for digital preservation has emerged. This article will take a retrospective look at challenges that have been faced and will review current and future priorities for those seeking to establish digital repositories. Digital preservation and open access to research data are now much higher up the agenda of funding bodies, but there is still lack of agreement on what constitutes a core digital archive from a fieldwork project. The paper will review what the significant properties of an archaeological archive are, and how reuse can be supported, linking data and publications. It will consider the challenge of dealing with the gray literature and of avoiding creating further data silos, featuring new initiatives to provide interoperability between digital repositories. It will review the role of data and metadata standards, and consider how the profession needs to address its responsibilities over the next 20 years."

J. Faundeen,2017,Developing criteria to establish trusted digital repositories,"This paper details the drivers, methods, and outcomes of the U.S. Geological Survey’s quest to establish criteria by which to judge its own digital preservation resources as Trusted Ðigital Repositories. Drivers included recent U.S. legislation focused on data and asset management conducted by federal agencies spending $100M USD or more annually on research activities. The methods entailed seeking existing evaluation criteria from national and international organizations such as International Standards Organization (ISO), U.S. Library of Congress, and Data Seal of Approval upon which to model USGS repository evaluations. Certification, complexity, cost, and usability of existing evaluation models were key considerations. The selected evaluation method was derived to allow the repository evaluation process to be transparent, understandable, and defensible; factors that are critical for judging competing, internal units. Implementing the chosen evaluation criteria involved establishing a cross-agency, multi-disciplinary team that interfaced across the organization. © 2017 The Author(s)."

We interlink key information contained in the documents of the collection, which can be essentially conceptualised as automatic hypertext generation. With this semantic layer on top of the set of documents in place, we attempt to identify interesting, surprising, eyeopening relationships between different concepts or entities mentioned in the document collection.

This case study is based on an MSc dissertation research undertaken at Northumbria University. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed methods case study used quantitative and qualitative data to explore the preservation requirements and triangulation to strengthen the design validity. Corporate and the wider scientific priorities were identified through literature and a stakeholder survey. Organisational preparedness was investigated through staff interviews. Findings: Stakeholders expect data to be reliable, reusable and available in preferred formats. To ensure digital continuity, the creation of high-quality metadata is critical, and data depositors need data management training to achieve this. Recommendations include completing a risk assessment, creating a digital asset register and a technology watch to mitigate against risks. Research limitations/implications: The main constraint in this study is the lack of generalisability of results. As the NGDC is a unique organisation, it may not be possible to generalise the organisational findings, although those relating to research data management may be transferrable. Originality/value: This research examines the specific nature of geoscience data retention requirements and looks at existing NGDC procedures in terms of enhancing digital continuity, providing new knowledge on the preservation requirements for a number of national datasets. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

K. Duretec; A. Rauber; C. Becker,2017,A Text Extraction Software Benchmark Based on a Synthesized Dataset,"Text extraction plays an important function for data processing workflows in digital libraries. For example, it is a crucial prerequisite for evaluating the quality of migrated textual documents. Complex file formats make the extraction process error-prone and have made it very challenging to verify the correctness of extraction components. Based on digital preservation and information retrieval scenarios, three quality requirements in terms of effectiveness of text extraction tools are identified: 1) is a certain text snippet correctly extracted from a document, 2) does the extracted text appear in the right order relatively to other elements and, 3) is the structure of the text preserved. A number of text extraction tools is available fulfilling these three quality requirements to various degrees. However, systematic benchmarks to evaluate those tools are still missing, mainly due to the lack of datasets with accompanying ground truth. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First we describe a dataset generation method based on model driven engineering principles and use it to synthesize a dataset and its ground truth directly from a model. Second, we define a benchmark for text extraction tools and complete an experiment to calculate performance measures for several tools that cover the three quality requirements. The results demonstrate the benefits of the approach in terms of scalability and effectiveness in generating ground truth for content and structure of text elements. © 2017 IEEE."
K. Duretec; C. Becker,2017,Format technology lifecycle analysis,"The lifecycles of format technology have been a defining concern for digital stewardship research and practice. However, little evidence exists to provide robust methods for assessing the state of any given format technology and describing its evolution over time. This article introduces relevant models from diffusion theory and market research and presents a replicable analysis method to compute models of technology evolution. Data cleansing and the combination of multiple data sources enable the application of nonlinear regression to estimate the parameters of the Bass diffusion model on format technology market lifecycles. Through its application to a longitudinal data set from the UK Web Archive, we demonstrate that the method produces reliable results and show that the Bass model can be used to describe format lifecycles. By analyzing adoption patterns across market segments, new insights are inferred about how the diffusion of formats and products such as applications occurs over time. The analysis provides a stepping stone to a more robust and evidence-based approach to model technology evolution. © 2017 ASIS&T"

Although initiatives in digital preservation in Europe, North America, Asia and sporadic attempts in Africa appear to have yielded some level of progress, permanent access to information and longevity of digital records continue to be a problem. Whilst Africa’s contribution to the growth of digital records may be insignificant, it is growing and Ghana cannot be insulated from this threat of digital growth. This paper examines the current challenges of digital preservation in sub-Saharan Africa with particular reference to Ghana. It identified funding, level of security and privacy, skills training and technological obsolescence as factors that pose key threats to digital preservation.

For this reason, data infrastructure research has gone beyond the technical work of data management, standardization and digital preservation. There is also a growing body of research that looks at the organizational practices and structures of data repositories and infrastructures for the long term and how they shape and reflect technologies, policies, stakeholder needs and priorities, professions and business models. We intend to use this panel to engage the audience in an ongoing conversation about organizational studies, sustainability planning and infrastructure. Panel members will present their research on these topics in different case sites and explore how governance, policies and organizational structures and practices are involved in the maintenance and repair of data infrastructures. We want to know more from the audience about how they are examining policies, business models, governance structures and artifacts in other sites; gaps and needs in research and practice; and next steps for researchers. Some questions of interest: How do repositories define success? How do they make their case for long-term funding and institutional homes? What scalar issues will arise in the context of even bigger data sources? How do data projects end? We will engage each other and the audience in discussing these questions and concerns.

L. de Biagi; R. Puccinelli,2017,‘Grey crossroads’ in cultural heritage preservation and resource management,"Among the assets that make up the cultural heritage of a country, a special place is assigned to the internal documents produced by organs and entities belonging to the Public Administration. In the public sector, for example, the minutes of meetings of the Boards of Directors are considered historical documents and as such are preserved in the for a long time. Actually from them it is possible to gain insight about the genesis of important decisions which affected the lives of many people. In some countries there is a legal obligation to deposit those documents in long term digital preservation systems, which adhere to ad hoc defined standards. In our opinion, many of those documents can be reckoned as grey literature assets and, beyond “plain and simple” preservation, some additional measures may be deployed in order to extract information and insights from them. In this paper we illustrate a process to collect those assets, cleanse and enrich their metadata and then store them in ad hoc defined data marts, upon which Business Intelligence tools can be used for data navigation and analysis. We finally show some examples of insights that may be acquired from such analysis. © 2017 TextRelease."

L. Maroye; S. van Hooland; F. Aranguren Celorrio; S. Soyez; B. Losdyck; O. Vanreck; C. de Terwangne,2017,Managing electronic records across organizational boundaries: The experience of the Belgian federal government in automating investigation processes,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the reasons behind the relatively poor level of implementation of e-services. To this end, records management procedures in a particular Belgian federal administration – the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) Employment, Labor and Social Dialogue – will be studied. Based on this concrete and relevant case study, the authors examine how cross-organizational differences in terms of the implementation speed of digital workflows can hinder the development of innovative e-services. By doing so, the authors raise relevant questions about the efficacy of digital workflows and work processes. The impact on the consultation and exchange of government records among public services and toward citizens will be examined as well. Design/methodology/approach: In the context of an on-going four-year research project named HECTOR (Hybrid Electronic Curation, Transformation and Organization of Records), the study is conducted from an interdisciplinary approach, closely combining information sciences and law. Moreover, this approach also has implications on information sciences through the integration of archival principles at an early stage of conception of hybrid (paper-based and digital-based) records management strategies, instead of confining archivists to a depository and preservation role. This “integrated archival” approach is highly encouraged to anticipate best practices for the long-term preservation of records (Rousseau and Couture, 1994). Furthermore, the project adopts a bottom-up approach based on an exploratory analysis of the particularities of hybrid records management within a project called “e-PV” led by the FPS Employment, Labor and Social Dialogue to draw general conclusions that could eventually be applied to other public services. In this case study, standardized surveys were used to collect information from a manager perspective, followed by in-depth interviews with field workers. Findings: The miscellaneous reasons for the aforementioned poor level of implementation are a continuously decreasing public budget, a strongly rooted resistance to change, the difficult but inevitable cross-organizational relations between public administrations, the legal uncertainties arising from a fast-changing digital environment and the political autonomy in the decision-making process of the different public entities. As a consequence, the substantial differences between the many public administrations lead to a lack of interoperability not only at a technical level but also at an organizational level. The many local and other non-connected initiatives that this situation has generated do not help fostering collaboration either. The absence of well-established records management policies is interpreted both as a cause and a consequence of some of the factors mentioned before. Research limitations/implications: Research is carried out within Belgium’s particularly complex administrative context, where competences are not only spread but also shared at multiple levels (national and regional) and in multiple domains (legislative and executive). Consequently, the political decision-making process is also highly complex. Nevertheless, the observations and the findings of the study are deemed to be applicable to any administrative structure (both national and international ones). Originality/value: This paper outlines the constraints of an almost completely implemented eGovernment initiative which may guide other public administrations in the development of their own e-services, as well as showing them the importance of taking into account records management and archiving principles. The multidisciplinary approach represents a significant added value. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
L. P. Da Silva; M. M. Borges,2017,Digital preservation policies of the institutional repositories at Brazilian Federal Universities,"Purpose: This paper aims to verify the implementation of digital preservation policies at the institutional repositories (IRs) of Brazilian Federal Universities. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used involved the verification of the information available in the Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) and on the websites of the IRs, to confirm the existence of published digital preservation policies. In this study, a sample of the 26 IRs of Brazilian Federal Universities registered with OpenDOAR, which represents 68 per cent of these repositories, was used. Findings: The main conclusion is that the IRs of these universities do not have any published digital preservation policies, even though some repositories state their intentionofpreserving digital material in their institutional information policy. Originality/value: The stakeholders of IRs need to implement a programme to guide their activities to preserve digital materials inthe long term.Infact, similartoexamples worldwide, this programme should take the form of an institutional commitment outlined in a digital preservation policy. IRs at Brazilian Federal Universities still have a long way to go to guarantee access to digital materials in the long term. © Emerald Publishing Limited."

L. Petti; F. Barone; A. Mammone; G. Giordano,2017,Static and dynamic behaviour assessment of the trajan arch by means of new monitoring technologies,"An effective assessment of the static and dynamic structural behavior of historical monuments requires the development and validation of suitable adaptive structural models using high-quality experimental data acquired with an effectively continuous and distributed monitoring. Furthermore, the adaptive strategy allows an efficient evaluation of the health status and of the evolution along the time of a historical monument, providing relevant information to plan appropriate actions for its long-Term preservation. The Trajan Arch in Benevento chosen as a case of study to develop and apply this new adaptive strategy in cultural heritage conservation. The paper, after a description of the innovative monitoring system, based on state-of-The-Art mechanical sensors, presents and discusses the results of two tests, comparing the measurements with the predictions of an adaptive structural FEM model developed for the dynamical simulation of the Trajan Arch. © Authors 2017."

De Coppi,2017,Long-term cryopreservation of decellularised oesophagi for tissue engineering clinical application,"Oesophageal tissue engineering is a therapeutic alternative when oesophageal replacement is required. Decellularised scaffolds are ideal as they are derived from tissue-specific extracellular matrix and are non-immunogenic. However, appropriate preservation may significantly affect scaffold behaviour. Here we aim to prove that an effective method for shortand long-term preservation can be applied to tissue engineered products allowing their translation to clinical application. Rabbit oesophagi were decellularised using the detergentenzymatic treatment (DET), a combination of deionised water, sodium deoxycholate and DNase-I. Samples were stored in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 4°C (4°C) or slow cooled in medium with 10% Me2SO at -1°C/min followed by storage in liquid nitrogen (SCM). Structural and functional analyses were performed prior to and after 2 and 4 weeks and 3 and 6 months of storage under each condition. Efficient decellularisation was achieved after 2 cycles of DET as determined with histology and DNA quantification, with preservation of the ECM. Only the SCM method, commonly used for cell storage, maintained the architecture and biomechanical properties of the scaffold up to 6 months. On the contrary, 4°C method was effective for short-term storage but led to a progressive distortion and degradation of the tissue architecture at the following time points. Efficient storage allows a timely use of decellularised oesophagi, essential for clinical translation. Here we describe that slow cooling with cryoprotectant solution in liquid nitrogen vapour leads to reliable long-term storage of decellularised oesophageal scaffolds for tissue engineering purposes. © 2017 Urbani et al.

M. A. Sicilia; E. García-Barriocanal; S. Sánchez-Alonso,2017,Community Curation in Open Dataset Repositories: Insights from Zenodo,"The increasing concern for the availability of scientific data has resulted in a number of initiatives promoting the archival and curation of datasets as a legitimate research outcome. Among them, dataset repositories fill the gap of providing long-term preservation of diverse kinds of data along with its meta-descriptions, and support citation. Unsurprisingly, the concern for quality arises as in the publication of papers. However, repositories support a larger variety of use cases, and many of them implement minimal control on the data uploaded by users. An approach to tackle with quality control in repositories is that of letting communities of users to filter the relevant resources for them, at the same time providing some form of trust to users of the data. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the extent to which this social approach that relies on communities self-organizing actually contributes to the effective organization inside repositories. This paper reports the results of a study on the Zenodo repository, describing its main contents and how communities have emerged naturally around the deposited contents. © 2017 The Authors."
M. Balzani; F. Maietti; B.

An applied research focused on the analysis of surface specifications and material properties by means of 3D laser scanner survey has been developed within the project of Digital Preservation of FAUUSP building, Faculdade de Arquitetura e Urbanismo da Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. The integrated 3D survey has been performed by the DIAPReM Center of the Department of Architecture of the University of Ferrara in cooperation with the FAUUSP. The 3D survey has allowed the realization of a point cloud model of the external surfaces, as the basis to investigate in detail the formal characteristics, geometric textures and surface features. The digital geometric model was also the basis for processing the intensity values acquired by laser scanning instrument; this method of analysis was an essential integration to the macroscopic investigations in order to manage additional information related to surface characteristics displayable on the point cloud."
M. Costa; D. Gomes; M. J. Silva,2017,The evolution of web archiving,"Web archives preserve information published on the web or digitized from printed publications. Much of this information is unique and historically valuable. However, the lack of knowledge about the global status of web archiving initiatives hamper their improvement and collaboration. To overcome this problem, we conducted two surveys, in 2010 and 2014, which provide a comprehensive characterization on web archiving initiatives and their evolution. We identified several patterns and trends that highlight challenges and opportunities. We discuss these patterns and trends that enable to define strategies, estimate resources and provide guidelines for research and development of better technology. Our results show that during the last years there was a significant growth in initiatives and countries hosting these initiatives, volume of data and number of contents preserved. While this indicates that the web archiving community is dedicating a growing effort on preserving digital information, other results presented throughout the paper raise concerns such as the small amount of archived data in comparison with the amount of data that is being published online. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) storage survey provides a rare opportunity to examine the practices of most major US memory institutions. The repeated, longitudinal design of the NDSA storage surveys offer a rare opportunity to more reliably detect trends within and among preservation institutions rather than the typical surveys of digital preservation, which are based on one-time measures and convenience (Internet-based) samples. The survey was conducted in 2011 and in 2013. The results from these surveys have revealed notable trends, including continuity of practice within organizations over time, growth rates of content exceeding predictions, shifts in content availability requirements, and limited adoption of best practices for interval fixity checking and the Trusted Digital Repositories (TDR) checklist. Responses from new memory organizations increased the variety of preservation practice reflected in the survey responses. © 2017 Michelle Gallinger, Jefferson Bailey, Karen Cariani, Trevor Owens and Micah Altman."

To provide grounded evidence, a foundational paper explored eight initial themes that constitute potential building blocks [1]. In order for a CAS community to emerge, further studies are needed to test this framework. While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage. The Human Face of Big Data project, a digital curation and interface design project for urban renewal data, is presented and analyzed to demonstrate the validity of the suggested heuristics. Finally, implications for CAS and future work are discussed. © 2017 IEEE."

It can represent a good alternative to obtain 3D information for monitoring and conservation of cultural heritage assets, especially where it is not possible to use 3D laser scanners and also in situations where areas to be inspected are not easily accessible [1]. Resolution generally depends on the number of images, their quality and the level of overlap between them, as well as hardware and software capabilities. Starting from 2D aerial or terrestrial photographic images, photogrammetry allows to reconstruct a 3D model in the form of a point cloud"" and also to derive accurate 3D measurements of large architectural elements. This paper is about stereo-photogrammetric scanning by drone performed by MENCI software s.r.l. aimed at the definition of the state of conservation of the ""Bridge of the Towers"" in Spoleto and its long term preservation without building scaffoldings. It was performed within the RoMA (Resilience enhancement of a Metropolitan Area) project, through an agreement between the ""Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development"" (ENEA) and the ""Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities"" (MIBACT). Photogrammetric scanning and FE modelling were applied within the project together with many other monitoring techniques in order to assess the bridge cracks pattern and its structural health by a multidisciplinary approach that allows their mutual validation [2]. As one of the most important problems in the use of photogrammetric 3D reconstruction is the considerable demand in terms of hardware and software resources for images processing and data storage, thanks to the HPC (High Performance Computing) resources provided by the CRESCO infrastructure (Research Computational Centre on Complex Systems), it was possible to analyse and process a large amount of high-resolution photos in order to detect the crack pattern and to assess the actual damage state to be monitored over time [3]. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications."""

Two cases studies have been considered. The first one called HERBADROP is concerned with preservation and analysis of herbarium images. The second one called EUROPEANA investigates how to facilitate the re-use of cultural heritage language resources for research purposes. The common point between these two case studies is that they are both concerned with the use of valuable heritage resources within the EUDAT (European Data) infrastructure. HERBADROP leverages on the data services provided by EUDAT for long-term preservation, while EUROPEANA leverages on EUDAT to achieve citability and persistent identification of cultural heritage datasets. EUDAT1 is an initiative of some of the main European data centers and together with community research infrastructure organisations, to build a common eInfrastructure for general research data management.

A showcase with re-use scenario,"The IANUS project, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), is building a digital archive and portal for archaeology and ancient studies in Germany. Following a 3-year phase of conceptual work, the archive and portal are now being implemented and the data center is beginning its operational work. Data curation is essential for preservation of digital data and helps to detect errors, aggregate documentation, and ensure the reusability of data; in some cases, it can also add useful additional files and functionality. This paper presents the workflow of data curation based on a data collection about European vertebrate fauna. It exemplifies the different stages of processing a dataset at IANUS according to the OAIS model – from its initial submission until its final presentation on the data portal. Data access and reusability can be enhanced by enrichment, in the case of the vertebrate fauna dataset, by GIS integration of geographic information and reutilization of bibliography. Furthermore, a data re-use scenario is presented in which the dataset has been integrated with one from another repository by using Semantic Web technologies. © 2017 SDH Open Access Journal"

P. Svärd,2017,The woes of Swedish private archival institutions,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the long-term preservation challenges that the Swedish private archives are faced with. In as much as they offer a complement to the public archives and hence offer a nuanced national narrative, they lack both financial and human resources to effectively deal with the digital information management environment. Design/methodology/approach: Participatory Action Research (PAR) was used to identify the challenges of long-term preservation together with the six private archives institutions that were involved in the collaboration. The collaboration was financially facilitated by the Södertörn University. PAR is defined as a systematic investigation, with the collaboration of those affected by the issue being studied, for the purposes of education and taking action or effecting social change. What is distinctive of PAR is the active involvement of people whose lives are affected by the phenomenon under study. Findings: The private archival institutions face long-term preservation challenges such as lack of a digital repository that would facilitate the capture, organization and management of digital records that are of different formats and in a dispersed environment. There are no stringent legal requirements to facilitate the creation and management of the records in a standardized way and the institutions fear that imposing such requirements might deter their clients from depositing archival materials with them. The institutions will also need to espouse the business-oriented archival descriptions where private organizations are concerned to identify relevant archival materials and to promote participatory archival descriptions that would allow the creators to tag their records with metadata. Digital information requires a proactive approach, that is, planning for the long-term preservation of the information before it is created. Private archives need to invest in education packages that will facilitate their clientele’s understanding of the challenges of digital long-term preservation. Research limitations/implications: The findings cannot be generalized to all private archival institutions, as it was only six institutions that participated, but the issues discussed are relevant to most archival institutions. Practical implications: A lot of research has been carried out in the area of long-term preservation, but researchers have not paid enough attention to the woes of the private archives. To sustain a nuanced national narrative, the private archives need all the support to be able to live up to their mission of preserving archives of the private sector that are not captured by the public archival institutions. This is important in a pluralistic society such as Sweden. Highlighting the challenges might enable the institutions to work towards finding common challenges. Social implications: The private archives are part of Sweden’s national heritage. Their preservation matters to the society as a whole and to enhancing the voices of the underrepresented. Originality/value: The literature review revealed that not much research has paid attention to the challenges being faced by the private archives. This paper, therefore, contributes to this knowledge gap. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
P. Verhaar; F. Schoots; L. Sesink; F. Frederiks,2017,Fostering effective data management practices at Leiden university,"At Leiden University, it is increasingly recognised that effective data management forms an integral component of responsible research. To actively promote the stewardship of all the research data that are produced at Leiden University, a comprehensive, institution-wide programme was launched in 2015, which centrally aims to encourage its researchers to carefully plan the temporal storage, long-term preservation and potential reuse of their data. This programme, which is managed centrally by the Department of Academic Affairs, and which receives important contributions from academic staff, from Leiden University Libraries, and from the University’s central ICT organisation, basically consists of three parts. Firstly, a basic central policy has been formulated, containing clear guidelines for activities before, during and after research projects. The central aim of this institutional policy is to ensure that all Leiden-based research projects can effectively comply with the most common requirements stipulated by funding agencies, academic publishers, the Dutch standard evaluation protocol and the European data protection directive. As a second part of the data management programme, faculties have organised workshops and meetings, concentrating on the rationale and on the technical and organisational practicalities of effective data management in order to bring about a discipline-specific protocol. Data librarians employed by Leiden University Libraries have developed educational materials and provide training for PhDs in the principles and benefits of good data management. Thirdly, to ensure that scholars can genuinely make a reasoned selection among the many tools that are currently available, a central catalogue was developed which lists and characterises the most relevant data management services. The catalogue currently provides information about, amongst many other aspects, the organisations behind these services, the main academic disciplines which are targeted and the accepted file formats and metadata formats. The various aspects of these facilities have been classified using terminology provided by conceptual models developed by the UKDA, ANDS and the DCC. Using Leiden University’s policy guidelines as criteria, the overall suitability of each service has also been evaluated. Leiden University’s data management programme has a total duration of three years, and its basic objective is to offer a comprehensive form of support, in which the data management policy which is propagated centrally is complemented by various forms of assistance which ought to make it easier for scholars to adhere to this policy. The catalogue of data management services also aims to bolster the implementation of an adequate technical infrastructure, as the qualitative evaluations of the services enable policy-makers and developers to quickly establish gaps or other shortcomings within existing facilities. © 2017, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

R. Costa; G. Lemos de Souza Filho; V. Becker; A. Malaguti,2017,We need to talk about digital preservation of audiovisual collections: Strategies for building national networks,"This paper is about the relevance of creating national networks to digital preservation of audiovisual collections, from both film and television industry. The proposal arises from the perception that, in the same proportion that the audiovisual production is being created in digital formats, it is expected the preservation of such information to be based on appropriate techniques and technologies also digital. It is similarly considered that the concern of digitization and preservation of collections are present in several initiatives guiding public policy in many countries. Based on the experiments already undergoing in the world, especially in the most advanced countries in the area, it is possible to predict that the building of a national network for the promotion of audiovisual digital preservation, with range and broad scope, can significantly contribute to the development of the national expertise in the area, to consolidate partnerships and to leverage the emergence of solutions adapted to the context of each country. Steps in this direction could include, among other actions, the promotion of two complementary strands of initiatives: (a) the organization of a consortium of public and private organizations interested in digital preservation; and (b) assembling a “backbone” of national repositories for large-scale digital preservation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."
R. Earnshaw,2017,Digital libraries,"The digital revolution is having effects on the development, organization, and distribution of information and artefact repositories such as libraries, and the way in which physical and digital aspects are mediated to users.

A review of library and related provision in higher education in the UK was commissioned in 1992 and reported on at the end of 1993. Many academic institutions and organizations have developed their own Institutional Repositories in order to store their own content. The advantages of digital libraries are summarized. The Google Digitization Project to digitize the world’s information is reviewed and evaluated. Recent significant difficulties with the Project are summarized. There also current issues in ensuring digital archives remain accessible to users into the long term future and are not rendered obsolete by future shifts in technology. The changes that digital media and digital convergence are bringing about are substantial and are also likely to be long-lasting. © The Author(s) 2017."
R. Fraimow; M. B. Mink; M. Padilla,2017,The National Digital Stewardship Residency: Building a community of practice through postgraduate training and education,"The National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) program addresses the need for a dedicated community of professionals with the knowledge and technical skills to ensure the long-term viability of the digital record by matching recent postgraduate degree recipients with cultural heritage institutions to manage digital stewardship projects. Since the initial NDSR DC pilot program, there have been five more iterations of the program - NDSR New York, NDSR Boston, American Archive of Public Broadcasting NDSR, NDSR Art, and Biodiversity Heritage Library NDSR. Although these programs share the same characteristics, each operates independently and no formalized guidelines or standards currently exist to link all the programs together. In the fall of 2015, the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) was awarded an IMLS grant to evaluate the early NDSR programs. By providing a comprehensive picture of the NDSR programs that were completed by 2016, the study was intended to help the NDSR community build connections across initiatives and learn from the experiences of its first participants. IMLS also funded the NDSR Symposium planned for April 2017, which will serve as an opportunity to bring stakeholders together to incorporate the strongest practices of each iteration and develop a standardized model for future programs."
R. Göldner,2017,"Archiving archaeological research data. On requirements, objectives and first experiences from a German respectively saxon point of view","Preserving digital data over long periods of time is an ambitious task. While most analogue documents are best stored without touching them, digital data need permanent care and curation. Regarding some differences between analogue and digital data—lifecycle, complexity, functionality and so on—it can be seen that digital archiving is a new challenge. This paper will deal with the requirements and objectives of archiving archaeological research data, as discussed in a working group of the Association of State Archaeologists in Germany (Verband der Landesarchäologen in Deutschland – VLA). Interesting themes of the discussions were “Archive Objectives,” “Worthiness of Archiving,” “Suitability of Archiving” and “Future Use Scenarios.” This paper will also deal with first experiences in building up a digital archive for archaeological research data in Saxony. The archive follows the principles of the “Open Archival Information System” (OAIS). It is based on professional software that has to be adapted to the special requirements of archaeological data such as excavation documentation. OAIS defines various complex functions to be performed, e.g., data management and preservation planning. Preservation strategies are presented here to give an idea of how to preserve the content and function of archived material while the systems for archiving are changing over time. This is an alternative to the idea that knowing file formats will solve all preservation problems. Archiving is the most intensive and most expensive way to store data. But are there no alternatives? This paper will address some small steps that lead towards proper archiving without large budgets. Such steps will help to reduce the risk of losing important digital information, and will also bridge the gap until proper preservation tools become available at a reasonable price. This article may be helpful for archaeologists that are about to build up an archive to preserve digital data for the long term. The concept of preservation strategies presented here may also be of interest for specialists in digital archiving. © 2017 SDH Open Access Journal"
R. J. Sandusky,2017,How recordkeeping ensures trust in digital archives,"Imagine a researcher in 2067 examining objects in a digital archive that were deposited in the early 21st century. How can the researcher be assured that those digital materials – whether born-digital or digital surrogates of analog materials – have not been accidentally or maliciously altered sometime during the intervening decades? Ten archival workers – archivists, metadata specialists, digitization managers and preservation technologists – were interviewed about how contemporary recordkeeping practices ensure the authenticity of born-digital files and digital surrogates for future users of the archive. This poster presents preliminary results about how archives are adapting to emergent needs for processing digital materials at scale, ensuring that workflows capture entities, activities and agents (provenance information), and ensuring that current systems support migration of provenance information to successor systems.

Ide-Ektessabi,2017,A novel scanning technique for imaging of gold and silver foils used in art works,"Digital archiving has seen rapid growth in the recent years, accompanied by ever-increasing demands for high resolution and high-color definition color images. Despite the advances in imaging techniques, gold leaves and golden objects remain as some of the most difficult-to-image materials due to their highly reflective surfaces. Oversaturation commonly occurs when direct reflection is captured by an imaging element. To solve this problem, we have developed a new scanner-type image acquisition method which can acquire high-resolution digital image and high-definition color information. In this paper, we outline the strategy employed in the new system to image gold, i.e., adjustment of light sources with respect to the sensor and use of polarizing filters to separate specular and diffuse reflection components. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."
R. Kurazume; S. Oshima; S. Nagakura; Y. Jeong; Y. Iwashita,2017,Automatic large-scale three dimensional modeling using cooperative multiple robots,"3D modeling of real objects by a 3D laser scanner has become popular in many applications, such as reverse engineering of petrochemical plants, civil engineering and construction, and digital preservation of cultural properties. Despite the development of lightweight and high-speed laser scanners, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still heavy burdens for widespread use of laser scanning. To solve these problems, a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots has been proposed. This system, named CPS-SLAM, consists of a parent robot with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers. A large-scale 3D model is acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on the parent robot from several positions determined precisely by a localization technique, named the Cooperative Positioning System (CPS), that uses multiple robots. Therefore, this system can build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP. In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a very precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops. This paper proposes an automatic planning technique for a laser measurement by using CPS-SLAM. Planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure makes it possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment. The proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling. We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique. © 2016 The Author(s)"
R.-q. Wu; I. Destech Publicat,2017,Analysis on Electronic File Management of Publishers,"Digital publishing is the inevitable direction of the development of the publishing industry, various types of electronic files will be produced in digital publishing process. Electronic files are unstable, easy to be damaged, easy to be leaked and so on. Publishers' core asset is the content, while the electronic content is the lifeblood of publishers. Therefore, the electronic file management is particularly important for publishers. The electronic file management is a complex system, which involves management methods, management techniques, standards, regulations and security issues. The purpose is to ensure the long-term preservation of electronic files in the process of formation and utilization and archive, which can be developed and utilized for a long time."

S. C. Ukwoma; V. W. Dike,2017,Academics’ attitudes toward the utilization of institutional repositories in Nigerian universities,"This study was carried out to ascertain the attitudes of academics concerning the utilization of institutional repositories (IRs) in Nigerian universities. The study took the form of a descriptive survey, gathering data from the five Nigerian universities with IRs. The result showed that the universities developed IRs to create a forum for their research, to collaborate with colleagues, and for long-term preservation. Academics have positive attitudes toward the utilization of IRs, and they willingly submit their publications. They believe that publishing works on institutional repositories will improve accessibility to scholarly literature and increase the citation impact of their work. The implication of this study is that academics’ support of institutional repositories favors the growth of IRs in Nigeria. Their contributions and observations will have a considerable impact on the improvement of IRs generally. © 2017 by Johns Hopkins University Press."

S. Harris,2017,2016 top trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries,"Purpose: Biennially, the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL), a division of the American Library Association, publishes a report on the top trends and issues affecting academic libraries in higher education. Harris (2016) used the trends and issues reported by the ACRL to inform a document and thematic analysis of publications written on Jamaican academic librarianship 2010-2016, to investigate the trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. Harris’ (2016) paper however noted that a survey of the chief librarian in each library, regarding their perceptions of the trends and issues would be a useful follow-up to her study, and cited this as a limitation/implication of her paper. The purpose of this paper is to address the above limitation and is therefore the follow-up to Harris’ (2016) paper. Design/methodology/approach: The chief librarians in five of the six local university libraries were surveyed to provide insights into the trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries at the university level. Findings: Acquisitions, budget, staffing, communicating value, digital preservation and curation, mobile environment, collaboration, scholarly communication, information technology, space, higher education, user behaviour and expectations and information literacy are the top trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries at the university level. Research limitations/implications: This survey seeks to complement rather than contest Harris’ (2016) research. Perhaps a useful follow-up to both papers would be biennial updates. Additionally, a survey of the trends and issues in all types of academic libraries throughout the English-speaking Caribbean would be a useful follow-up. Originality/value: This paper is of value, as it is the first survey of trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship. It enriches the existing document and thematic analytical research on trends and issues in Jamaican academic libraries by adding an empirical component. It also increases the number of publications, on trends and issues in Jamaican academic librarianship, from one to two, and allows voices from the English-speaking Caribbean (Jamaica) to be incorporated into the literature dedicated to trends and issues in academic libraries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

S. Mannheimer; C. Cote,2017,"Cultivate, assess, advocate, implement, and sustain: A five-point plan for successful digital preservation collaborations","Purpose: For libraries with limited resources, digital preservation can seem like a daunting responsibility. Forming partnerships can help build collective knowledge and maximize combined resources to achieve digital preservation goals. This paper aims to provide guidance to help libraries with limited resources achieve digital preservation goals by forming partnerships to build collective knowledge and maximize combined resources. Design/methodology/approach: In 2015, librarians from four Montana institutions formed the Digital Preservation Working Group (DPWG), a collaboration to increase digital preservation efforts statewide. The group’s immediate goals were to promote digital preservation best-practices at each individual institution, and to learn about and support each other’s work. The group’s long-term goal was to implement a shared digital preservation service that would fill gaps in existing digital preservation efforts. Findings: Beyond the cost savings gained by sharing a digital preservation service, the members of DPWG benefitted from shared knowledge and expertise gained during the partnership. The group also functioned as a sounding board as each institution built its digital preservation program, and it became a system of support when challenges arose. Practical/implications: This paper proposes a five-point plan for creating digital preservation partnerships: cultivate a foundation of knowledge and identify a shared vision; assess the current digital preservation landscape at each institution; advocate for the value of digital preservation activities; implement shared digital preservation services; and sustain group activities and establish structures for ongoing support. Originality/value: The activities of DPWG provide a model for institutions seeking to collaborate to meet digital preservation challenges. This paper shows that by implementing a structured plan, institutions can build and sustain digital preservation partnerships, thus positioning themselves to achieve digital preservation success. © 2017, © Sara Mannheimer and Conor Cote."
S. Prater,2017,How to talk to it about digital preservation,"When an archivist talks with the information technology (IT) personnel about providing access to digital collections, the discussion often proceeds smoothly. They have shared assumptions, the common goal of the platform is well understood by both parties, and the vocabulary used to describe actions, tasks, and items is substantially the same, or at least agreed-upon. However, when the discussion turns to digital preservation, there may be a divergence in priorities and understanding. While the archivist’s priority is on making sure their digital assets are preserved and accessible forever, the IT personnel’s focus may be on making current data publicly accessible, making sure that systems are running smoothly right now. To further complicate matters, IT personnel have been performing an activity that sounds very much like digital preservation: archiving, backups, and storage of multiple copies. This column will explore the convergence and divergence of the archival and IT professions in regards to digital preservation, as well as suggest the topics and questions that need to be discussed so that both parties have a mutual understanding of meeting the needs of providing appropriate digital preservation. © 2018 Scott Prater."

Design/methodology/approach: This work provides a case study detailing the work and outcomes of a digital preservation pilot project undertaken by the Five College Libraries between 2014 and 2015. Findings: Digital preservation is a broad endeavor and rapidly developing facet of digital collections and institutional repositories; yet, it is often an area that is not fully understood or implemented by many libraries and archives, largely because institutions lack the necessary resources to do it alone. Working across institutional lines provides a possible solution to overcoming resource limitations and general challenges for pursuing robust digital preservation programs. Research limitations/implications: Findings reported in this work are based on a limited-scope pilot project. Several questions laid out during the pilot remain unanswered at its close. Originality/value: This paper provides insight into an experimental process rarely reported in library and information science literature. The goal of the paper is to provide a reference point for institutions pursuing a consortial approach to the challenges of applied digital preservation practice. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
S. Welland,2017,'Us and them': expert and practitioner viewpoints on small New Zealand community archives,"Introduction. This article presents one aspect of a wider research project into New Zealand community archives. It focuses on how key aspects affecting community archives (for example, collaboration, digital archiving, and community engagement) are perceived differently by experts and practitioners.Method. A qualitative research method was used, in two stages. Stage one involved semi-struc tured interviews and on-site visits with five community archivists. Stage two used three iterative survey rounds of surveys with fifteen experts using the Delphi research method.Analysis and Results. he nature of community archives continues to be ambiguous to many working in the heritage information and recordkeeping sectors. While expert and practitioner groups had similar perceptions of some areas, they saw others quite differently. These different perceptions may lead to assumptions by each group that propagated notions of ` us and them'. Reasons for these different perceptions include the community archivists' community-based focus and their immediate work environment, and the experts' society-wide focus and greater awareness of industry practice.Conclusion. Opportunities are needed for t hese groups to share their different perceptions to help reduce professional and practical misunderstandings. Different perceptions may restrict collaboration within the heritage information and recordkeeping sectors, and hinder the development of community archives and the recognition of their unique role in the archival world."

Tanaka,2017,Improving Transparent Visualization of Large-Scale Laser-Scanned Point Clouds by Using Poisson Disk Sampling,"In recent years, due to the development of laser-measurement technology, 3D laser-scanned point clouds for cultural assets are often used as the recording format of digital archiving. The acquired point clouds are large-scale and precisely record complex 3D internal structures of the scanned objects. Visualization quality of such point clouds highly depends on density distributional uniformity, that is, the uniformity of the inter-point distances. The visualization quality can be improved by making point distances uniform. In addition, the visibility further improves by emphasizing edges. In this study, first the uniformity and flexible tuning of the point density based on Poisson disk sampling are examined. The resultant high-quality point clouds are then applied to transparent visualization. Moreover, edge emphasis visualization is realized by combining the principal component analysis calculating feature amount and Poisson disk sampling. © 2017 IEEE."

T. Çakmak; B. Yilmaz,2017,Digitization and digital preservation in memory institutions: Analysis of the practices in Turkey,"Cultural heritage as an indicator that shows the existence and the structure of a society, is a concept that fundamentally based on the transmission of cultural values and objects among the generations. This feature of the concept requires effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Libraries, archives and museums are cultural institutions that efficently use ICT in order to provide value added services for their users. As one of these services, digitization practices contain many decision making processes for libraries, archives and museums. This study aims to analyze the practices of Turkish memory instutions having responsibilities for the issues related to digitization and digital preservation of cultural heritage objects. In this regard, this study conceptually discusses cultural heritage and libraries, archives and museums as cultural memory institutions and their digitization attempts in context of the developments in Turkey. In the light of description method obtained by SPSS Statistics 21 software, 14 cultural memory institutions contributing to digitization practices in Turkey were surveyed via a research instrument which was developed according to literature review, digitization and digital preservation approaches, and models and research model. Results reflect that there are some insufficiencies related to current situation analysis, planning and decision making phases and finalizing digitization projects. Results reflect that there is a need not only for sustainable digitization programmes but also for institutional digitization and digital preservation policies in analyzed memory instiutions."

T. Lowe,2017,Artists' Books and the Problem of Digital Preservation,"Artists' books have become a popular genre for many institutions collecting art objects and unique books. The attempt to preserve the physical artists' books often competes with the desire to extend user access to these highly tactile works. Partial digitization of artists' books has allowed many institutions to cultivate an online presence for these collections, increasing access without compromising the physical integrity of the objects. However, creation of digital surrogates for artists' books often sacrifices the authenticity and access to the intellectual content of the work. The challenge of digital preservation for artists' books demonstrates the shortcomings of digital reformatting for works that may be intellectual and artistic. © 2017 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
T. R. Hart; D. De Vries,2017,Metadata provenance and vulnerability,"The preservation of digital objects has become an urgent task in recent years as it has been realised that digital media have a short life span. The pace of technological change makes accessing these media increasingly difficult. Digital preservation is primarily accomplished by main methods, migration and emulation. Migration has been proven to be a lossy method for many types of digital objects. Emulation is much more complex; however, it allows preserved digital objects to be rendered in their original format, which is especially important for complex types such as those comprising multiple dynamic files. Both methods rely on good metadata to maintain change history or construct an accurate representation of the required system environment. In this paper, we present our findings that show the vulnerability of metadata and how easily they can be lost and corrupted by everyday use. Furthermore, this paper aspires to raise awareness and to emphasise the necessity of caution and expertise when handling digital data by highlighting the importance of provenance metadata."

A 3D approach,"This paper reports an aspect of the on-going project of my dissertation thesis at the Institute for Classical Archaeology at Charles University in Prague and concerns the application of multi-image photogrammetry technique in the documentation of the Etruscan rock-cut tomb façades. Etruscan rock-cut tombs with decorated façades are located in the inland area of Southern Etruria (currently Tuscany and Lazio, Italy). This paper focuses on the architecture of the tombs dated to the Hellenistic period (from the 4th century BC to the end of the 3rd-beginning of the 2nd century BC), when a significant change in architecture of the tombs took place. The aim of this paper is to show how 3D models acquired with the multi-image photogrammetry technique can serve as a tool for the archaeological analysis of the tomb façades. The acquired data and 3D models can be used for the documentation and digital preservation of the tomb decorations, which are exposed to heavy erosion mainly caused by water and vegetation. This paper also explains how acquired data can serve as well for the creation of the virtual reconstruction and virtual anastylosis of the tomb façades with missing fragments of decorations or fragments scattered around sites or in museums. © 2017 Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

V. A. Dressler,2017,The state of affairs with digital preservation at ARL member libraries: A survey and analysis of policy,"Purpose: Digital preservation is a term that is a bit of an enigma to many people both in and out of the digital arena, but it will undoubtedly be important in an increasingly all-digital world. The underlying work relating to digital preservation is essential to the long-term care of digital media, but who is charged with addressing this type of work, and can policy serve to structure and also reflect this complex concept? The main point of interest for this study is to examine existing digital preservation policies at Association of Research Libraries (ARL) institutions and analyze the content of the policies. The purpose will be to determine if these policies are able to provide a robust framework for true digital preservation work at this point in time. First, an introduction is made to provide the structure of the study and background. Next, a literature review is provided, followed by an outline of the methods and results of the study, and finally a conclusion with recommendations for future research. Design/methodology/approach: An analysis of digital preservation policy at ARL institutions is conducted, with recommendations provided for further research. Findings: This study was an attempt to highlight the current state of digital preservation policies, reviewing both the positive elements and the shortcomings of policies at ARL member institutions. The call for policies made for this study resulted in finding that 32 (26 per cent) ARL institutions currently have a digital preservation policy in place, from the institutions that responded (58 per cent response rate). In total, 23/40 institutions without a current policy indicate there is, or will be, work to complete a policy within the coming year (2016-2017). A call can be made at this time for more in-depth research and analysis of the policies for further inquiry. Both effective (University of Houston, University of Florida, York University) and ineffective (Colorado State University, University of Texas, Virginia Tech) digital preservation policies were discovered during the course of the study, with many policies falling somewhere in the middle. Many institutions provided a good template for digital preservation but lacked details for how this work would be addressed and who would be completing such work. Research limitations/implications: Limited to ARL member institutions at the time of the study (January 2016). Originality/value: There is currently a gap in analysis and research of digital preservation policies. This is an area of active policy creation for many institutions, and it will likely be a growing area for researchers to examine. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."

Craigle,2017,Digital preservation of law reviews: Two ways,"Purpose: This paper will aim to explain two strategies for digital preservation of law reviews, informing law librarians of the options which might best suit their needs. Design/methodology/approach: On November 7, 2008, the Durham Statement on Open Access to Legal Scholarship was released to the public. One of its main tenets – that law schools and libraries “stop publishing journals in print format and rely instead on electronic publication coupled with a commitment to keep the electronic versions available in stable, open, digital formats” – was an open call to law libraries to start thinking about digital preservation strategies for their law reviews. The Legal Information Preservation Alliance responded to the need by developing the Law Review Preservation Program, an initiative, which archives law reviews hosted on the Bepress Digital Commons (DC) platform in Controlled LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) or CLOCKSS. Findings: For those law libraries without subscriptions to DC, there is an open-source, freely available alternative solution for ingesting digital law reviews into any preservation platform. This application, called the Submission Information Metadata Packaging, or SIMP tool was developed at the J. Willard Marriott Library at the University of Utah, initially as a solution for ingesting content into the Ex Libris Rosetta Digital preservation platform, as part of a CONTENTdm digital asset management workflow. Though the development of the SIMP tool was inspired by Marriott’s need to ingest digital files from CONTENTdm to Rosetta, they built it to work with any Digital Asset Management System and Digital preservation platform. Originality/value: Digital Preservation of law reviews is in its infancy. This is one of the first articles of its kind to provide specific solutions and technical advice for law libraries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited."
V. Gilissen; H. Hollander,2017,Archiving the past while keeping up with the times,"The e-depot for Dutch archaeology started as a project at Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) in 2004 and developed into a successful service, which has ever since been part of the national archaeological data workflow of the Netherlands. While continuously processing archaeological datasets and publications and developing expertise regarding data preservation, various developments are taking place in the data landscape and direct involvement is necessary to ensure that the needs of the designated community are best met. Standard protocols must be defined for the processing of data with the best guarantees for long-term preservation and accessibility. Monitoring the actual use of file formats and the use of their significant characteristics within specific scientific disciplines is needed to keep strategies up-to-date. National developments include the definition of a national metadata exchange protocol, its accommodation in the DANS EASY self-deposit archive and its role in the central channelling of information submission. In an international context, projects such as ARIADNE and PARTHENOS enable further developments regarding data preservation and dissemination. The opportunities provided by such international projects enriched the data by improving options for data reuse, including the implementation of a map-based search facility on DANS EASY. The projects also provide a platform for sharing of expertise via international collaboration. This paper details the positioning of the data archive in the research data cycle and presents examples of the data enrichment enabled by collaboration within international projects. © 2017 SDH Open Access Journal"

The development of 3D laser scanning and printing technology in recent years is described and the author laments the apparent lack of attention to the long-term preservation of the resulting data. While the agencies involved in creating 3D data do seem to understand the long-term value of the data, they have not taken sufficient action to ensure the value is maintained. In this article a challenge is posed to address the gap between the communities who create 3D data and those with the expertise to manage and preserve it for the long-term. © 2017 Icon, The Institute of Conservation."

Although the query efficiency can be increased if the number of sides of n-sided polygon decreases, the search precision can be reduced accordingly. Thus, in the proposed approach, the query efficiency and search precision can be well controlled according to the requirements of different applications. The experimental results show that the proposed polygon approximation based approach can improve query efficiency if users do not demand very high search precision. © 2017 IEEE."
W. Xu; M. Esteva; D. Beck; Y. H. Hsieh,2017,A Portable Strategy for Preserving Web Applications Functionality,"The value of research data not only resides in its content but in how it is made available to users. Research data is often presented interactively through a web application, the design of which is often the result of years of work by researchers. Therefore, preserving the data and the application's functionalities becomes equally important. However, preserving web applications, which are commonly deployed within shared and changing technology infrastructures, presents challenges to the reproducibility and portability of the application across technology platforms over time. We propose a functional preservation strategy to decouple web applications and their corresponding data from their hosting environments. The strategy allows re-launching the applications in more portable, simplified environments without compromising their interactive features, and it allows reusing the data in other technical and functional contexts. The strategy fits well with the evolving nature of digital preservation and with the requirements for data reuse. We demonstrate this approach and its evaluation using the Speech Presentation in Homeric Epic digital humanities project. © 2017 IEEE."
X. Sixin; Y. Yayuan; Y. J. Jiang; W. Yue,2017,A New Governance Architecture for Government Information Resources Based on Big Data Ecological Environment in China,"In this paper, the characteristics and effects of the data-open, function-reform and data-governance in the process of dealing with the challenges brought by the age of big data, were analyzed firstly. In China, these action plans adopted by governments have brought new changes in government functions restructuring, leading to a new pattern of government information resources management. Secondly, the two typical models of Chinese government information resources management, which came out with IT involving and E-government system getting more involved, were summarized. As well as the application features and scenarios of these two models were compared. Finally, according to the trend of Big-Data Bureau widely established in China, Heterogeneous business system formed and massive data generated in various formats, a new pattern of government information resources governance will emerge, that is, big data service centers and intelligent archives will become the basements for storage, accessing, utilization and long-term preservation of government data resources. The value of big data service center is to provide broad and intelligence information service. The Intelligence Archive will provide professional archives management for society leaving tracks, evidence persistency, and national memory. In this new patter, three aspects of the problem need to focus on solving by adopting various key technologies based on the 'ABC' Ecological System. The First is the rational allocation of functions between the Big-Data Bureau and Intelligent archives; the second is to capture the valuable data automatically from E-government system using intelligent sensor technology; the third is the implementation of resources automatic archiving, that is, data migrating from e-government business systems to the large data centers and an intelligent archive by using intelligent artificial and machine learning technologies. © 2017 IEEE."
Y. C.

In the past several years, library market budgets showed rapid and steady growth in China. The fast growth posed a challenge to the long-term storage of digital resources. Four years ago, the China National Publications Import & Export (Group) Corporation launched a digital resource platform “CNPeReading” to build bridges between upstream content providers and downstream customers, in which an integrated service model including a long-term storage implementation was presented. So far, CNPeReading has made satisfactory progress in providing better user experience, lower latency and higher availability for library customers. Also, many overseas publishers have rapidly adapted to the Chinese institutional markets through the CNPeReading platform. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
A. Bakos; T. Miksa; A. Rauber,2018,Research data preservation using process engines and machine-actionable data management plans,"Scientific experiments in various domains require nowadays collecting, processing, and reusing data. Researchers have to comply with funder policies that prescribe how data should be managed, shared and preserved. In most cases this has to be documented in data management plans. When data is selected and moved into a repository when project ends, it is often hard for researchers to identify which files need to be preserved and where they are located. For this reason, we need a mechanism that allows researchers to integrate preservation functionality into their daily workflows of data management to avoid situations in which scientific data is not properly preserved. In this paper we demonstrate how systems used for managing data during research can be extended with preservation functions using process engines that run pre-defined preservation workflows. We also show a prototype of a machine-actionable data management plan that is automatically generated during this process to document actions performed. Thus, we break the traditional distinction between platforms for managing data during research and repositories used for preservation afterwards. Furthermore, we show how researchers can easier comply with funder requirements while reducing their effort. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
A. Belhi; A. Bouras; S. Foufou,2018,Towards a Hierarchical Multitask Classification Framework for Cultural Heritage,"Digital technologies such as 3D imaging, data analytics and computer vision opened the door to a large set of applications in cultural heritage. Digital acquisition of a cultural assets takes nowadays a couple of seconds thanks to the achievements in 2D and 3D acquisition technologies. However, enriching these cultural assets with labels and relevant metadata is still not fully automatized especially due to their nature and specificities. With the recent publication of several cultural heritage datasets, many researchers are tackling the challenge of effectively classifying and annotating digital heritage. The challenges that are often addressed are related to visual recognition and image classification. In this paper, we present a novel approach of hierarchical classification for cultural heritage assets. The metadata structural differences that exist between cultural assets motivated us to design a classification framework that can efficiently perform the classification of multiple types of assets. Our approach relies on several deep learning classifiers, each of them is assigned the task of classifying a certain type of assets. The classification framework starts the labeling process by first determining the asset type. The asset is then assigned to a specific classifier in order to be annotated with data fields related to its type. As a preliminary step, we successfully designed a general cultural type classifier and a specific type classifier for paintings. Our approach is currently achieving interesting results and is set to be improved by the integration of more asset types. © 2018 IEEE."

Educational Social Curation [1] is refers to using social curation for learning purposes i.e. the process of creation a personal ontology by the learner, in which the essence is the learning process and not only the product. The study included 78 preservice teachers, which produced altogether 46 summaries and insights regarding their experience throughout the BA course Digital Curation"" in the year 2016-17. The data was collected from reflections written by participants at the end of the course. Findings indicate that participants focused on 5 major themes in their writing: cognitive, authentic learning, emotional-motivational, connectivity and ethical aspects. The cognitive aspect, of curation, including viewpoints as students and as future teachers, and the contribution of curation to authentic learning, encompassed the majority of phrases. The conclusions of the study are consistent with the assumption according to which mastery of technological tools is a prerequisite to the activities of preservice teachers as a digital curator. However, this is not the only condition. Educational Social curation is an activity that promoted 21st century skills, exemplifies authentic learning, and is highly connected to emotional and motivational aspects of the learner."""
A. Fisher,2018,African cinema on demand? The politics of online distribution and the case of the African film library,"This article considers the impact of online distribution on the long-term availability and preservation of African cinema. It examines the case of Electronic Media Network’s (M-Net) African Film Library (AFL), a video-on-demand (VOD) library of classic African films that was launched in 2012, but taken offline by 2013. The article argues that this short-lived project represents a pivotal moment in the way we think about African film archiving and distribution, in which new technologies and consequently disintermediated business models promised to facilitate the circulation of African films in a manner that was socially beneficial, but which in reality resulted in monopolistic control of the content that presented a serious threat to its long-term preservation. The article goes on to argue that the AFL case encapsulates the entire discourse surrounding the shift to online distribution, in which a ‘cyber-topian’ narrative of a disintermediated and thus democratized film culture quickly gives way to a reality in which content is more tightly controlled by an increasingly narrow and powerful set of private stakeholders, ultimately threatening the preservation of any content that is vulnerable to the shifting demands of the market. © 2018 Intellect Ltd Article."
A. Fritz,2018,From collection silos to digital content hubs: Digital project management in special collections and university archives,"Purpose This chapter discusses how digital project management has fundamentally changed the nature of collection service models in university archives and special collections. Methodology/approach Through a conceptual overview of case studies, this chapter examines the establishment of “digital content hubs,” with a special focus on the ways in which a variety of library units share the work of surfacing distinctive collections through cross-functional team-building. Findings To successfully build “digital content hubs,” academic libraries have embraced a new alignment to incorporate special collections and archives staff, services, and collections more holistically into larger library collecting initiatives and organizational structures. This chapter posits that, through the stewardship of digital projects, archivists and librarians have had to sharpen and expand requisite managerial and technical skills to support “distinctive collection teams” who work cross-functionality with outward-facing approaches to integrated collection building. In addition to embracing assessment tools and diversified funding strategies, archives and special collections have also adopted new collaboration models reliant on centralized but flexible project management structures that emphasize cross-training, complementary subject and technological specializations, and a team-based focus in order to ensure interoperability, sustainability, and broad accessibility of digital collections. Originality/value This chapter offers readers a new way of conceptualizing “distinctive collection teams,” proposes some strategies for marshaling resources from across library units, and suggests ways in which librarians and archivists can collaborate on content selection, copyright clearance, metadata creation, and web design and information technology development. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

This cutting-edge technology is suitable for interactive presentation of materials which are too fragile to leaf through. Fully aware of the importance of the availability and open access to cultural and scientific heritage for achieving the knowledge society and the role of academic libraries in its dissemination, these extremely vulnerable materials are also presented in the open access repository, which will include research papers based on the materials available within the project. So, the objects can be analyzed both ""on the outside"" via the metadata and with the help of the software for editing digital repositories and ""on the inside"" via a concise overview of the content of individual objects. Digital objects structured in this way will grab users' attention and bring back the historical content into focus."""

A. Mallik; S. Chaudhury; V. Chandru; S. Srinivasan,2018,Digital hampi: Preserving indian cultural heritage,"The book represents the culmination of a hugely successful heritage preservation project initiated by the Government of India’s Department of Science and Technology. It presents extensive research on the digital preservation of the history, mythology, art, architecture and culture of the world heritage site Hampi in Karnataka, the seat of the Vijayanagara dynasty in medieval India. Further, the book introduces readers to a range of techniques developed by Indian technical research groups for digitally preserving both the tangible and intangible cultural heritage of the region. These techniques are sufficiently generic to be applied in heritage preservation efforts for other historical sites around the world as well. Technological advances have made it possible to not only create digital archives of these heritage artifacts, but to also share these resources for people to view, explore, experience, and analyze. This book showcases how cutting-edge technology can be combined with cultural and historical research to digitize and preserve heritage. It is the consolidation of work conducted under the Indian Digital Heritage project, a unique initiative of the Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India. The project involved collaboration between researchers in the areas of Technology, Computer Science, Architecture and the Humanities for the digital documentation and interpretation of India’s tangible and intangible heritage. It highlights the art, architecture, and cultural legacy of the world heritage site of Hampi in Karnataka, the medieval capital of the 14th-16th century Vijayanagara dynasty. The contributors to this book are scientists and technology experts from prominent academic institutes in India such as the IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology), NIIT, and NID (National Institute of Design) working in collaboration with some of India’s top architects, art historians, anthropologists, heritage groups and multi-disciplinary cultural institutions such as the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS). Their papers will introduce readers to cutting-edge technologies from research areas such as computer vision, 3D modeling and artificial intelligence as they are employed to preserve art and culture in the digital domain. The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 details efforts and techniques for modeling and representing the tangible heritage of Hampi, such as the reconstruction of damaged structures, realistic walk-throughs, and haptic rendering. Part 2 includes chapters detailing the analysis and digital restoration of artifacts such as mural paintings, inscriptions and sculptures, as well as mobile-based visual search for artifacts. Part 3 includes chapters on conjectural re-constructions of the architectural life, social life and traditions of Hampi.

The authors conducted 18 interviews with TSU professors working in different disciplines. The research focus was placed on the structure and content of the digital archives being formed, the ways of storing, organising and utilising digital materials, and on the creator's view of these practices. The qualitative analysis of the collected data showed that the increasing digitisation is changing the composition of the professors’ personal archives and the possibilities of using these archives, and is creating new challenges related to long-term preservation of digital documents – the challenges that these people are not always able and willing to embrace. The perspectives they have on personal digital archives are complex and multifaceted: these are seen as being important in practical terms – e.g., when one uses the archival materials for solving their current issues – and as having emotional value attached to them. Personal archiving can also be considered in the context of self-identification and self-representation. In this sense, personal digital archives are valuable for the creators and the academic community as a whole as potential sources on the history of science and education understood as personalised activity. © 2018 Tomsk State University.

A. Velte,2018,Ethical challenges and current practices in activist social media archives,"Social media (Web applications supporting communication between Internet users) empower current activist groups to create records of their activities. Recent digital collections, such as the digital archives of the Occupy Wall Street movement and the Documenting Ferguson Project, demonstrate archival interest in preserving and providing access to activist social media. Literature describing current practices exists for related topics such as Web and social media archives, privacy and access for digital materials, and activist archives. However, research on activist social media archives is scarce. These materials likely present subject- and format-specific challenges not yet identified in peer-reviewed research. Using a survey and semistructured interviews with archivists who collect activist social media, this study describes ethical challenges regarding acquisition and access. Specifically, the respondents were concerned about acquiring permission to collect and provide long-term access to activist groups' social media. When collecting social media as data sets, archivists currently intend to provide moderated access to the archives, whereas when dealing with social media accounts, archivists intend to seek permission to collect from the activist groups and provide access online. These current practices addressing ethical issues may serve as models for other institutions interested in collecting social media from activists. Understanding how to approach activist social media ethically decreases the risk that these important records of modern activism will be left out of the historical narrative. © Ashlyn Velte."

By doing so, it has joined the community of Web 2.0 national libraries worldwide, contributing to its visibility in the digital environment and the visibility of its services and holdings. Findings. Using the web archives, the Wayback Machine and the Croatian Web Archives (HAW), it has been found that the online contents, services and applications of the Library built over two decades ago were developed in accordance with its management, users’ needs and available technologies. As the web content is not available in its entirety, the long-term preservation and accessibility of its portals and related services should be highlighted as strategic goals of the institution. Practical implications. This research can be an encouragement and a model for other libraries and heritage institutions to explore their online presence as well as to plan archiving and long-term preservation and accessibility of their content in the online environment. Social implications. Long-term preservation and accessibility of the entire content of the National and University Library in Zagreb on the web are its tasks as a social, cultural and scientific institution. Originality. The development over two decades of various websites and portals of the National and University Library in Zagreb, including its presence on social networking sites, has been analyzed and described for the first time. The website changes affected by technology and the degree of their preservation and accessibility have been displayed. © VBH 2018."
B. Sprout; M. Jordan,2018,Distributed digital preservation: preserving open journal systems content in the PKP PN,"Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the public knowledge project (PKP) preservation network (PN), which provides free preservation services for eligible journals by collecting article content and preserving it in a network of (at the time of writing) eight “preservation nodes” using the LOCKSS system. The PKP PN was launched in June 2016. Design/methodology/approach: This paper addresses the development and implementation of a free, distributed digital PN for open journal systems (OJS) content. It discusses challenges in developing the network, in particular relating to preserving content from a set of partners who have no formal business relationship with PKP. The paper examines data regarding journals that have opted in to the network to date and considers interface usability and other barriers facing those that have not joined. Findings: Within 18 months of launch, more than 600 journals had opted to be preserved in the PKP PN. Many more journals are eligible to join the network; the paper explores potential strategies to increase participation and identifies and proposes methods to overcome technical and communication barriers. Originality/value: This paper describes a highly collaborative, open-source preservation initiative which forms a unique part of the e-journal preservation landscape and preserves a particularly vulnerable portion of the scholarly record. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
B. Wright; O. Brunner; B. Nebel,2018,On the importance of a research data archive,"As research becomes more and more data intensive, managing this data becomes a major challenge in any organization. At university level there is seldom a unified data management system in place. The general approach to storing data in such environments is to deploy network storage. Each member can store their data organized to their own likings in their dedicated location on the network. Additionally, users tend to store data in distributed manner such as on private devices, portable storage, or public and private repositories. Adding to this complexity, it is common for university departments to have high fluctuation of staff, resulting in major loss of information and data on an employee's departure. A common scenario then is that it is known that certain data has already been created via experiments or simulation. However, it can not be retrieved, resulting in a repetition of generation, which is costly and time-consuming. Additionally, as of recent years, publishers and funding agencies insist on storing, sharing, and reusing existing research data. We show how digital preservation can help group leaders and their employees cope with these issues, by introducing our own archival system OntoRAIS.

C. A. Lee,2018,Computer-Assisted Appraisal and Selection of Archival Materials,"Despite progress on various technologies to support both digital preservation and description of archival materials, we have still seen relatively little progress on software support for the core activities of selection and appraisal. There are two considerations that make selection and appraisal of digital materials substantially different from selection and appraisal of analog materials: that digital materials exist at multiple levels of representation and that they are directly machine readable. There are great opportunities to better assist selection and appraisal of digital materials, including use of digital forensics tools, natural language processing, and machine learning. © 2018 IEEE."
C. Becker,2018,"Metaphors we work by: Reframing digital objects, significant properties, and the design of digital preservation systems","Much digital preservation research has evolved around the idea of authentic digital objects and their significant properties. However, the nature of digital preservation work continues to be ill-defined. This paper unpacks definitions of digital objects and their significant properties to deconstruct misleading conflations. I review how the use of the terms digital object and significant properties has evolved in digital preservation, and I identify conceptual inconsistencies. By critiquing the system boundaries assigned by different writers to the term digital objects, I explore the metaphorical nature of the concept and show that the discourse routinely ignores the role of computation in favour of artifact-centred concepts of bits and records. As a consequence, I illustrate category errors around what it means to migrate and preserve digital objects. I suggest a reformulation of both terms based on their metaphorical nature and discuss how this reformulation aligns with insights from research on electronic records and digital preservation. The discussion shows that digital objects are best understood as a metaphorical concept that allows us to articulate the emergent properties of computed performances relying on data, software, and hardware. Significant properties are best understood as mechanisms that allow curators to specify shared understandings of what constitutes authentic reproductions of digital objects. At the core of digital preservation is the design of software-based information systems intended to reproduce authentic digital objects. The article thus contributes to a reframing of the nature of digital preservation and emphasizes the importance of the conceptual frame of computing and systems design in archival education and practice. © 2018, Association of Canadian Archivists.

The focus is on how new technologies are affecting the process of creation, opening up to new modes of interactions with the public, as well as in-stigating new approaches to cognition, memory and the means of registration. The research is inspired by and will make use of some methodologies and softwares (Piecemaker and MoSys) devel-oped and used by the Motion Bank project. As such, some 'chore-ographic objects' will be proposed based on three selected per-formances made in Brazil; furthermore, different approaches to handling digital archiving in dance will be explored. The main question of this research refers to the modes of dance using new technologies. We also want to test how much embodied experi-ences related to choreographic's principles can be amplified and perceived throughout the creative process of proposing choreo-graphic objects as well as sustaining the notions of bodies as dy-namical archives. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."

Unfortunately, these heritage elements have experienced considerable deterioration. This paper presents the results of a project whose main goal was the scientific investigation of the Imperial Gates belonging to the wooden church in Sălişca, Cluj County, Romania. To digitally preserve and document the Imperial Gates, a scientific investigation into the wooden support and the painting materials (ground, pigments) were performed using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy provided information about the wooden support, whereas XRF and FTIR methods were used to structurally characterize the painting materials. These structural data were correlated with the artistic, theological, and historical analysis of the religious heritage monument. Starting from the information acquired about the wooden support and the painting materials, the Imperial Gates were three-dimensional (3D) scanned using state-of-the-art laser scanners. The digitization of the Imperial Gates and the interior of the church was performed to maintain the current preservation status and disseminate this information to the public using online instruments. © 2018 by the author."
C. Rodrigues; A. F. Godoy Viera,2018,Criteria for adoption of e-books in libraries in the context of the paradigm of cloud computing,"Purpose: This paper aims to propose criteria and indicators for the adoption of e-books in libraries in the context of the cloud computing paradigm. Design/methodology/approach: This paper carried out bibliographical and documentary research and the application of a questionnaire. Sampling focused on five library managers and five e-book vendor managers. Findings: A proposal is presented containing a set of three criteria and their respective indicators. The technology platform criterion consists of seven indicators: patron data privacy, patron data security, availability of services, accessibility of information in e-books, interoperability of the technology platform, digital preservation and portability of e-books. The criterion for the acquisition of e-books involves three indicators: forms of commercialization, acquisition models and selection of e-book titles. The criterion for the circulation of e-books is divided into two indicators: unlimited and limited use. In the unlimited use mode, there are no limits on the use of e-books. In limited use, there are 11 levels of permissions: available copies, number of loans under each license, duration of the license, interlibrary loan, reading only in digital format, reading online via streaming only, download on the patron’s device, content printing, loan according to the patron’s identity, reservation services and renewal services. Practical implications: This paper provides a set of criteria and indicators that can aid in the construction of policies and the development of collections, programs and projects directed toward the use of e-books in libraries. Originality/value: This paper contributes socially by presenting a proposal that can support policies of evaluation and development of collections, projects, programs and actions around the adoption of e-books in different types of libraries. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

From there, a thematic analysis that allowed approaching some general guidelines to guide those interested in the preservation of digital documents of a textual nature was made. The practices carried out by these organizations are exposed and the learning that derives from these experiences is taken into account. Among them are: The importance that preservation is also assumed by those who produce digital content and not only by institutions dedicated to file management; integrate preservation in institutional planning; select the material according to the importance of the documents; the convenience of hiring services from specialized companies; generate preservation and distribution files; keep copies in different physical media and store them in spatially separate places. To preserve digital production, the individual user must resort to different storage systems, especially cloud services and various physical media. © 2018 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.All Rights Reserved."

Spomenik, was designed as a simple digital audio guide, embedded in a remote rural location (Kocevski Rog, Slovenia) to work without the infrastructure normally present at national memorial sites. By resurrecting voices and cultural narratives of the deceased and placing them back into the landscape through digital means, Spomenik opens a dialogue about the events of the past and their relation to networks of the living; it explored the role of voice and agency, as serviced through design, in the act of memorialization. This article presents a detailed case study of a design-led inquiry about digital memorialization and digital preservation of cultural heritage. It offers a reflective account of the nature of legacy and the extent to which it is (and perhaps should be) necessarily bound to networks of collective memory, mediated through designed cultural tools. © 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
D. M. Gerrard; J. E. Mooney; D. Thompson,2018,Digital preservation at Big Data scales: proposing a step-change in preservation system architectures,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to consider how digital preservation system architectures will support business analysis of large-scale collections of preserved resources, and the use of Big Data analyses by future researchers. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the architecture of existing systems, then discusses experimental surveys of large digital collections using existing digital preservation tools at Big Data scales. Finally, it introduces the design of a proposed new architecture to work with Big Data volumes of preserved digital resources – also based upon experience of managing a collection of 30 million digital images. Findings: Modern visualisation tools enable business analyses based on file-related metadata, but most currently available systems need more of this functionality “out-of-the-box”. Scalability of preservation architecture to Big Data volumes depends upon the ability to run preservation processes in parallel, so indexes that enable effective sub-division of collections are vital. Not all processes scale easily: those that do not require complex management. Practical implications: The complexities caused by scaling up to Big Data volumes can be seen as being at odds with preservation, where simplicity matters. However, the sustainability of preservation systems relates directly to their usefulness, and maintaining usefulness will increasingly depend upon being able to process digital resources at Big Data volumes. An effective balance between these conflicting situations must be struck. Originality/value: Preservation systems are at a step-change as they move to Big Data scale architectures and respond to more technical research processes. This paper is a timely illustration of the state of play at this pivotal moment. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

By the 10th century AD, ancient Ge'ez ceased to exist as a spoken language in Ethiopia. Spoken Ge'ez is split into many closely related tongues, mainly Tigirina in the North and Amharic in the South. However, written Ge'ez was kept firmly in use purely for sacred and scholarly endeavours, from the 13th to the 17th centuries, which is known as the classical period"" of Ethiopian literature. Ancient documents have great benefits for the modern world beyond cultural heritage. In recent years the digital archiving of ancient document is greatly expanding across the globe where ancient Ethiopian manuscripts written in Ge'ez language are beginning to appear in digital libraries and on the web. However, most of the documents are stored as raw images and they are not suitable for document processing and indexing. This reduces the usage of Ge'ez document in many research fields. Hence, there is a need for a recognition model that coverts raw images into machine encoded format. In the process of developing such a model, the document should be segmented into individual characters.The noise in old documents usually reduces the performance of many segmentation algorithms. This paper presents an image segmentation technique for the old Ge'ez handwritten documents. This segmentation technique outperforms the widely used watershed algorithm by 18.6% in terms of accuracy of segmentation. This will form part of the overall system for automatic optical character recognition for ancient Ge'ez handwritten documents."""

For decades we have been talking about an explosion of unconventional material. The development and quantity of new information were faster than us. In this paper, we wanted to point to some of the new circumstances of the archival service in Croatia, or the more or less the entire archival community. Archivists in Croatia were particularly interested in the adoption of the Law on amendments to the Law on archival material and archives in May 2017 and the recent adoption of a new, comprehensive Law on archival material and archives. In the context of these changes, which will happen in the future or have already occurred, we must ensure the protection and preservation of the authenticity of the already generated electronic material and conversion into a digital format suitable for long-term preservation and after being taken over to the archives. In addition, we must educate people new competencies. Encouraged by these changes, we will try to describe the prospect of future acquisitions policy of archives. © 2018, Maribor Provincial Archives.

Childers,2018,Software provenance: Track the reality not the virtual machine,"The growing use of computers and massive storage by individuals is driving interest in digital preservation. The scientific method demands accountability through digital reproducibility, adding another strong motivation for preservation. However, data alone can become obsolete if the interactivity of software required to interpret the data is lost. Virtual machines (VMs) may preserve interactivity however do so at the cost of obscuring the nature of what lies within. Occam, instead, builds VMs on-the-fly while storing and distributing well-described software packages. Thus, the system can track the exact components inside VMs without storing the machines themselves, allowing software to be repeatably built and executed. For Occam to recreate VMs, it needs to know exactly what software was used within. Through this tracking, such software can even be modified and rebuilt. Occam keeps track of all such components in manifests, allowing anybody to know exactly what is in each VM, and the origins of each component. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."
E. Boamah,2018,Relative Advantages of Digital Preservation Management in Developing Countries,"The purpose of this article is to explore stakeholders’ perspectives on the relative advances of digital preservation management over traditional heritage management approaches in developing countries, particularly in Africa. Specific examples from the context of Ghana are used to help understand the particular factors that influence the relative advantage of the digital preservation management innovation. The article is based on the findings of a PhD study that explored contextual factors influencing the management and preservation of digital cultural heritage resources in Ghana and it is underpinned by Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation model. An interpretive qualitative approach was employed to solicit the perspectives of 29 key stakeholders from 13 institutions in Ghana through semi-structure interviews. This was followed by an analysis of relevant literature to ascertain how the findings from the context of Ghana relate to other developing countries in Africa. Stakeholders perceive that the digital preservation management innovation has relative advantages over other traditional ways of managing and preserving heritage information in many ways, including; as an effective means to manage cultural heritage resources; enhancing collaboration and resource sharing; contributes to the building strong cultural institutions; leading to the establishment of a national digital memory for developing countries; as an effective means to preserve value of cultural identity for the long term into the digital future; and enabling research and advancement of cultural knowledge. Findings from the literature analysis also show that these relative advantages of the digital preservation management (DPM) innovation occur in similar forms in other developing countries in Africa. Further empirical studies in other developing countries are recommended to fully ascertain the main relative advantages of the DPM innovation over traditional approaches of heritage resources management and preservation. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © Eric Boamah."

E. J. Kim; J.

As recording cultural heritage data becomes more common, the importance of a reliable database is emphasized. However, if the verification of the produced digital heritage content is not correct, continuous errors are yielded in their applications and cultural heritage is misinterpreted. In this paper, we propose a consortium blockchain system for verifying digital cultural heritage contents. Blockchains, which have been applied to various fields recently, are a distributed data storage technology proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Blockchains are attracting attention as a technique for creating and storing reliable records owing to its property that it cannot be arbitrarily changed. We propose a verification system that is organized by three expert groups for assessment: researchers, curators, and artisans. The three expert groups review the digital heritage content and finally approve the content via a consensus process. To this end, the approved digital content is created as a block and stored in a blockchain record. We expect that the proposed consortium blockchain system will obtain efficiency and reliability in the screening process by leaving a reliable record of the digital content. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The record has grown over several decades with an established approach to the long term care and dissemination of documentary archives. We have been collecting digital archives since the early 1990s, but current approaches to describing and sharing digital archives are essentially a skeuomorph of traditional analogue methods - simply an activity at the end of the project or something 'the archive does'. For preservation of digital data to succeed, it requires collaboration between data creators and curators at an early stage. Digital formats offer new opportunities and insights beyond analogue archives and yet traditional approaches hinder the potential for maximising this knowledge. Digital archiving cannot simply mean the continuation of existing archival practices but requires collaboration at an early stage to ensure consistency of approach, to deliver efficiencies and benefits beyond individual projects and make connections across digital collections. . © Archaeopress and the authors 2018.

E. Popescu,2018,Open Access Strategy and the Role of Romanian Research Libraries in its Application,"Open access represents an important trend in research libraries' sector. Scholarly journals and books are at the heart of research and science, and, therefore, it is very important for Romanian research libraries to understand the aims, scope and impact of open access. Romania is the first country where EU Framework Programme for Research, Development and Innovation Horizon 2020 was launched and this can be an extremely significant opportunity for Romanian libraries to increase their role in scientific life. Nowadays, librarians are very much implied in search of scientific open access information, in order to support knowledge production and consumption in research institutes and universities. There are a lot of international success models for open access, and this aspect is very significant for Romanian librarians, in order to properly assist researchers in their work. The most important publishers support both gold and green open access, and, in matters pertaining this latter option, libraries offer their support by paying subscriptions to journals with open archive. As an example of positive attitude regarding open access and, implicitly, open science, a series of researchers at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy (IMAR) publish their articles in open access, and their works can be read free from EuDML (The European Digital Mathematics Library), on their personal pages which can be accessed from the web-page of IMAR, or in journals with open access policies. The article aims to present the results of a survey on opinions and approaches of IMAR's researchers regarding open access publishing. Digital preservation and data management are, also, vital for research libraries in contemporary digital age. Librarians supporting researchers in institutes and universities must also comply with the ethics principles of open access, in terms of copyright and licensing issues, and so they can better carry out their mission by supporting authors in publishing in open access their high quality results, in the context of the scientific developments in the modern world."

With Webchain, readers can independently detect content manipulation by verifying authenticity, integrity, and time consistency. At the same time, authors gain a proof of existence for referenced articles. Web-chain extends a well-known distributed timestamping scheme to handle an open and dynamic network topology by providing a solution for membership management.

F. Gallo; C. Niederée; W. Allasia,2018,Bridging information management and preservation: A reference model,"The idea of the Preserve-or-Forget (PoF) approach introduced in this book is to follow a forgetful, focused approach to digital preservation, which is inspired by human forgetting and remembering. Its goal is to ease the adoption of preservation technology especially in the personal and organizational context and to ensure that important content is kept safe, useful, and understandable in the long run. For this purpose, it stresses the smooth interaction between information management and preservation management. Leveraging the PoF approach, in this chapter we introduce a reference model, which will be referred to in the following as PoF Reference Model. The model pays special attention to the functionality which bridges between Information Management System (Active System) and Digital Preservation System (DPS), such as the selection of content for preservation and the transfer of content between the systems. The model aims to encapsulate the core ideas of the PoF approach, which considers Active System and DPS as a joint ecosystem into a re-usable model, and is inspired by the core principles of this approach: synergetic preservation, managed forgetting, and contextualized remembering. The design of the PoF Reference Model was driven by the identification of five required characteristics for such a reference model: it has to be integrative, value-driven, brain-inspired, forgetful, and evolution-aware. The PoF Reference Model consists of a functional part (Functional Model) and of an associated Information Model. The Functional Model is made up of three layers: Core Layer, Remember and Forget Layer, and Evolution Layer. For each layer, we discuss the main functional entities and the representative workflows, also relating them to existing standards and practices in digital preservation. The functionality required to mediate between the Active System and the DPS has been encapsulated into the PoF Middleware, which has been designed and implemented as part of the ForgetIT project. The Information Model describes the preservation entities and their relationships, also discussing the interoperability with existing digital preservation standards. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018."
F. Giannetti,2018,A twitter case study for assessing digital sound,"Academic and cultural heritage institutions around the world have made measurable strides in the development of digital sound archives oriented towards research and access, but their impact on scholarship and society has been little studied. Traditionally, impact has been measured by citations; yet these are problematic metrics for nontraditional outputs like sound recordings. Social media data provide a promising avenue of investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact. Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines. This study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five digital sound archives: British Library Sounds, Europeana Sounds, the Internet Archive Audio Archive, PennSound, and UbuWeb. By using text analysis methods to identify high-frequency events and trends, and labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital heritage resources, this study provides preliminary insights on user values as they relate to digital sound collections. Despite the limitations of using social media data, the evidence gathered in this case study characterizes aspects of the use of digital sound collections, and may point to future priorities for the digital preservation of sound. © 2018 ASIS&T"

G. Can; J. M. Odobez; D. Gatica-Perez,2018,How to tell ancient signs apart? Recognizing and visualizing maya glyphs with CNNs,"Thanks to the digital preservation of cultural heritage materials, multimedia tools (e.g., based on automatic visual processing) considerably ease the work of scholars in the humanities and help them to perform quantitative analysis of their data. In this context, this article assesses three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures along with three learning approaches to train them for hieroglyph classification, which is a very challenging task due to the limited availability of segmented ancient Maya glyphs. More precisely, the first approach, the baseline, relies on pretrained networks as feature extractor. The second one investigates a transfer learning method by fine-tuning a pretrained network for our glyph classification task. The third approach considers directly training networks from scratch with our glyph data. The merits of three different network architectures are compared: A generic sequential model (i.e., LeNet), a sketch-specific sequential network (i.e., Sketch-a-Net), and the recent Residual Networks. The sketch-specific model trained from scratch outperforms other models and training strategies. Even for a challenging 150-class classification task, this model achieves 70.3% average accuracy and proves itself promising in case of a small amount of cultural heritage shape data. Furthermore, we visualize the discriminative parts of glyphs with the recent Grad-CAM method, and demonstrate that the discriminative parts learned by the model agree, in general, with the expert annotation of the glyph specificity (diagnostic features). Finally, as a step toward systematic evaluation of these visualizations, we conduct a perceptual crowdsourcing study. Specifically, we analyze the interpretability of the representations from Sketch-a-Net and ResNet-50. Overall, our article takes two important steps toward providing tools to scholars in the digital humanities: Increased performance for automation and improved interpretability of algorithms. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."
G. Fan; S. Li,2018,Preserving trustworthy social media records under the open government framework in China,"In recent years, social media becomes one of the dominant platform for information disclosure and citizen engagement in China. Records created by these government social media accounts are valuable to preserve as they are significant evidences demonstrating Chinese government's interactions with its citizens in the open government movement. But considering the large volume, the fragmented and dynamic nature of social media records and the multiple participators in the activity that creating those records, how can the information with long-term value on the social media be preserved and in what ways can we guarantee the preserved records as trustworthy? This work-in-progress paper intends to answer this question through the lens of records management, especially with the support of Chain of preservation - a preservation model specifically designed by InterPARES 2 for records created using interactive and dynamic computer technology. The paper first offers a brief comparison between microblog and Wechat under the open government movement of China. Then the chain of preservation is introduced to lay as a foundation for further analysis upon stakeholders and their responsibilities concerning social records preservation. The last part identifies a series of key issues to be discussed in further study. Copyright © The Authors, 2018. All Rights Reserved."
G. Haile,2018,The Limits of Traditional Methods of Preserving Ethiopian Ge'ez Manuscripts,"The aim of the article is to identify the limits of traditional methods of preserving ancient parchment Ge'ez manuscripts found in churches and monasteries of Tigray, Ethiopia. The researcher used interview and observation methods to gather relevant data in regard to manuscript preservation practices in churches and monasteries of Tigray, Ethiopia. General Collection Condition Survey (GCCS) and an Item-by-Item Survey were also employed to assess the physical and preservation status of ancient Ge'ez manuscripts, while survey checklist was used to document preservation condition assessments. It was generally viewed that churches and monasteries in Tigray have been playing a pivotal role in the production as well as preservation of ancient Ge'ez parchment manuscripts, however, the assessment result shows most of the traditional techniques employed by these institutions to preserve manuscripts are neither functional nor strong enough to withstand the ever-growing human and natural impacts on these priceless artefacts. Therefore, the paper concludes that in view of the relevance of Ge'ez manuscripts for the Ethiopian people, as well as the poor state of affairs with regard to the preservation and availability of these manuscripts, a new approach that ensures long-term preservation and guarantees their availability for current and future generations should be designed. As a way forward, it is deemed necessary to accomplish in situ conservation and digitization works through scientific procedures and make the digital document available to the wider public using digital library technology. This new approach will enable us to rescue the vanishing literary heritage and unlock the local knowledge contained in those ancient Ge'ez manuscripts through systematic and scientific study as well as to ensure long term preservation. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

Kearns,2018,A conceptual enterprise framework for managing scientific data stewardship,"Scientific data stewardship is an important part of long-term preservation and the use/reuse of digital research data. It is critical for ensuring trustworthiness of data, products, and services, which is important for decision-making. Recent U.S. federal government directives and scientific organization guidelines have levied specific requirements, increasing the need for a more formal approach to ensuring that stewardship activities support compliance verification and reporting. However, many science data centers lack an integrated, systematic, and holistic framework to support such efforts. The current business-and process-oriented stewardship frameworks are too costly and lengthy for most data centers to implement. They often do not explicitly address the federal stewardship requirements and/or the uniqueness of geospatial data. This work proposes a data-centric conceptual enterprise framework for managing stewardship activities, based on the philosophy behind the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, a proven industrial concept. This framework, which includes the application of maturity assessment models, allows for quantitative evaluation of how organizations manage their stewardship activities and supports informed decision-making for continual improvement towards full compliance with federal, agency, and user requirements. © 2018, Ubiquity Press Ltd.

G. Sandhu,2018,The Role of Academic Libraries in the Digital Transformation of the Universities,"Digital transformation involves vision, strategy, people, processes, and technology. A digital university continuously exploits digital technologies to both create new sources of value for the university communities and increase operational agility for digital operational excellence. Academic libraries have the expertise and mindset of being early adopters of new technologies to perform activities such as digital curation, digital preservation, digital archiving etc. Hence, the role of academic libraries in the digital transformation of the universities becomes central. Only those universities that stay relevant and leverage the power of digital and put in place focused digital transformation will survive in the digital era. Indeed, libraries should act as a platform for digital transformation. Learning Commons, digital education centres, digital scholarship Centres, Information Commons have revolutionised teaching learning. Digital technologies are changing the way research is conducted.

H. Brown,2018,Managing disaster preparedness and response for hybrid collections in Australian national and state libraries,"In the 21st century cultural heritage collections are increasingly hybrid; not only do they contain physical materials, they also contain growing collections of digital materials. However, typically their disaster plans focus on managing just the physical collections. The digital collections are managed separately; commonly the disaster planning role is assigned to IT systems staff. This research investigated disaster preparedness in Australian national, state and territory libraries to gauge what areas might be common in disaster management of physical and digital collections, and also what might be different. It further investigated the potential for developing an integrated disaster plan that could align disaster responses across all collection formats–physical and digital. The author worked with experienced State Library of Queensland (SLQ) staff to develop a ‘proof of concept’ template for an integrated disaster plan, using the SLQ plan as a model. The research confirmed the feasibility and the benefits of an integrated plan as a ‘one stop shop’ source of disaster information. The research outcomes potentially have implications for more effectively protecting hybrid collections across the cultural heritage sectors internationally.

H. Ishikawa; K. Kaneko,2018,Polymorphic cataloguing and interactive 3D visualization for multiple context of digital content: MoSaIC,"In this paper, we propose two methods of interactive visualization of the MoSaIC catalogue. We proposed a conceptual modeling for manifold relationships among digital content files as polymorphic catalogues and its visualization system (MoSaIC-II) before. In the modeling, two structures are provided to express the relationships. One is “grouping objects”. The other is “associating between two objects”. The relationship is constructed by using the combination of two structures, and it is described by using directed graph called a MoSaIC catalogue. Multiple catalogues can be connected by shared objects polymorphically. To visualize the catalogue, we propose two methods which are polymorphic topology view and layer view in MoSaIC system using 3D computer graphics. In the previous method, some objects might be overlapped depending on object connections. Then a lot of objects and complex connection of edges can users feel complicated. Using the new methods, object overlap and the complexity of catalogue and object connections can be improved. In the polymorphic topology view, users can see topology of connected objects avoiding object overlaps. Furthermore, we propose the layer view to show objects aligned by a catalogue creator. In the layer view, users can see connected objects which are aligned and exhibited on each catalogue layer. In this method, a complex connection of edges is improved and comparatively a lot of objects can be handled. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018."

Hung,2018,Dunhuang mural restoration using deep learning,"As time goes by, the art pieces inside Dunhuang Grottoes have suffered from tremendous damage such as mural deterioration, and they are usually difficult to be repaired. Although we can achieve digital preservation by modeling the caves and preserving mural as textures in virtual environment, we still cannot have a glimpse of how the grottoes look like without damage. In this work, we propose a systematic restoration framework, which is based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) technique, for these highresolution but deteriorated mural textures. The main idea is to make the machine learn the transformation between deteriorated mural textures and restored mural textures. However, the resolution of training texture images (i.e. 8192x8192) is too high to be applied with GAN technology directly due to GPU RAM limitation. Instead, our method restores a set of high-resolution yet colorinconsistent textures patch-by-patch and a set of low-resolutionbut color-consistent full textures, and then combines them to get the final high-resolution and color-consistent result. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

I. Dillo; L. de Leeuw,2018,Coretrustseal,"Open data and data management policies that call for the long-term storage and accessibility of data are becoming more and more commonplace in the research community. With it the need for trustworthy data repositories to store and disseminate data is growing. CoreTrustSeal, a community based and non-profit organisation, offers data repositories a core level certification based on the DSA-WDS Core Trustworthy Data Repositories Requirements catalogue and procedures. This universal catalogue of requirements reflects the core characteristics of trustworthy data repositories. Core certification involves an uncomplicated process whereby data repositories supply evidence that they are sustainable and trustworthy. A repository first conducts an internal self-assessment, which is then reviewed by community peers. Once the self-assessment is found adequate the CoreTrustSeal board certifies the repository with a CoreTrustSeal. The Seal is valid for a period of three years. Being a certified repository has several external and internal benefits. It for instance improves the quality and transparency of internal processes, increases awareness of and compliance with established standards, builds stakeholder confidence, enhances the reputation of the repository, and demonstrates that the repository is following good practices. It is also offering a benchmark for comparison and helps to determine the strengths and weaknesses of a repository. In the future we foresee a larger uptake through different domains, not in the least because within the European Open Science Cloud, the FAIR principles and therefore also the certification of trustworthy digital repositories holding data is becoming increasingly important. Next to that the CoreTrustSeal requirements will most probably become a European Technical standard which can be used in procurement (under review by the European Commission). © 2018, Vereinigung Osterreichischer Bibliothekarinnen und Bibliothekare.

Although the applications using the obtained digital 3D scan data are widely developed, their data management and quality verification does not conducted properly. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel verification framework based on the comparisons of shape and color information between an original image and an image from 3D scan data (i.e., mesh data with color mapping). Firstly, to verify that they are the identical object, we use the shape contexts information based on a machine learning technique. Secondly, we compare the color information between them for verifying its quality of color mapping. Utilizing the proposed framework, we expect that non-experts can verify the quality of 3D scan data automatically, thus, museum itself will be able to manage the 3D scan data systematically and reliably. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."
J. H. Chang; P. S. Chiu; Y. M. Huang,2018,A sharing mind map-oriented approach to enhance collaborative mobile learning With digital archiving systems,"With the advances in mobile network technology, the use of portable devices and mobile networks for learning is not limited by time and space. Such use, in combination with appropriate learning strategies, can achieve a better effect. Despite the effectiveness of mobile learning, students' learning direction, progress, and achievement may differ. Thus, the enhancement of learners' opinions on the usability and interactivity during mobile learning are challenging issues to overcome. This study developed a sharing mind map-oriented mobile learning system integrated with valuable information preserved in a digital archiving system. In addition to the functions of traditional mind maps, this system also enabled students to complete and record relevant information that they had found onto the mind map and further improve the integrity of their own knowledge. To investigate the effectiveness of this teaching approach, this study added digital archive data and used mind map sharing to help learners develop knowledge. By using the proposed approach, students were able to perform self-assessment on learning content, choose appropriate learning directions, and progress according to their level of learning. At the same time, they could collaboratively learn with peers to engage themselves more deeply in their learning. That is, their learning motivation could be constantly triggered through the observations and sharing of mind maps from one to another. This study selected sixth graders as its research subjects in two classes at the school where one researcher works. There were 31 and 30 valid samples in the experimental group and control group, respectively, with a total of 61 students. The experimental group was conducted by using sharing mind map with corresponding geographical archived information to investigate the effectiveness of sharing mind map (SMM) in mobile learning; on the other hand, the control group was conducted by using a traditional learning approach. The outcomes indicate that students' learning performance could be enhanced by using archived information SMM mobile learning. © 2018, Athabasca University."

Grochowski,2018,Long-term preservation of deprecated media: How can libraries provide information from today's CD-ROMs in the Future?,"New data storage media advances in the 1990s brought changes to publishing practices. Storage media had gone through a series of progressions, and with falling costs of digital media, publishers now had new and affordable options for supplementing or publishing new works. Some print books included supplementary information on computer disks, and in other cases publishers made complete works available on computer disk instead of in print format. These changes in publishing are apparent in the University of Michigan (U-M) Library's engineering collection, which now includes a large collection of resources acquired in CD-ROM format. Today, the library faces concerns about the long-term viability and access to these resources. Computer storage media have already evolved from 5.25 floppy disks to 3.5"" floppy disks to CD-ROMs to DVD-ROMs to USB drives. since computer manufacturers are phasing out optical drives, users now have few options for using library materials that are formatted on disks of any kind. This ""technological obsolescence"" has prompted the engineering librarians at U-M to investigate how to continue providing access to materials that are published on computer disk in a future age where computer users will not have the required hardware or software available for reading the disks. Working with the library's Digital Preservation Librarian, the engineering librarians will determine which of the engineering resources that are published in disk format must be preserved, and they will plan for best practices for preservation of, and access to, the selected resources. Only complete works published on CD-ROM are reviewed in this project. This paper will report on methods used to evaluate and decisions about long-term retention and preservation of these resources, as well as strategies for avoiding this problem in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018."""

K. Dohe; R. Pike,2018,Integration of project management techniques in digital projects,"Purpose Project management techniques for digital initiatives must shift with the transformation of content from analog to digital, from singular projects to mass-digitization and large-scale digital preservation. How are project management methods employed across digital practices, from digitization, to online access, to preservation? How can project management methods evolve to create a collaborative workflow across collection and service areas of librarianship, centered on digital stewardship? Methodology/approach Solutions for these questions are illustrated in an explanation of the workflows implemented at the University of Maryland, College Park Libraries and reflected upon in a case study of a recent digital initiative. Findings Centered on the efforts of two departments in the Libraries’ Digital Systems and Stewardship division, this chapter outlines the origins, techniques, and integration of digital project management with a focus on Waterfall and Agile project management. Furthermore, the integration and transition of project management methodologies and tools between groups is emphasized, mirroring the transformation of analog media to digital formats and the requisite shifts in thinking such projects require. Originality/value These case studies are based on research across the profession and implementation at the University of Maryland, College Park Libraries. The local application of two established project management techniques, Waterfall and Agile, are summarized and compared. Though regularly employed in application development, applying Agile project management in libraries is a relatively new practice and has not been widely documented in library literature. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved."
K. F. Gracy,2018,Enriching and enhancing moving images with Linked Data: An exploration in the alignment of metadata models,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the current state of Linked Data (LD) in archival moving image description, and propose ways in which current metadata records can be enriched and enhanced by interlinking such metadata with relevant information found in other data sets. Design/methodology/approach: Several possible metadata models for moving image production and archiving are considered, including models from records management, digital curation, and the recent BIBFRAME AV Modeling Study. This research also explores how mappings between archival moving image records and relevant external data sources might be drawn, and what gaps exist between current vocabularies and what is needed to record and make accessible the full lifecycle of archiving through production, use, and reuse. Findings: The author notes several major impediments to implementation of LD for archival moving images. The various pieces of information about creators, places, and events found in moving image records are not easily connected to relevant information in other sources because they are often not semantically defined within the record and can be hidden in unstructured fields. Libraries, archives, and museums must work on aligning the various vocabularies and schemas of potential value for archival moving image description to enable interlinking between vocabularies currently in use and those which are used by external data sets. Alignment of vocabularies is often complicated by mismatches in granularity between vocabularies. Research limitations/implications: The focus is on how these models inform functional requirements for access and other archival activities, and how the field might benefit from having a common metadata model for critical archival descriptive activities. Practical implications: By having a shared model, archivists may more easily align current vocabularies and develop new vocabularies and schemas to address the needs of moving image data creators and scholars. Originality/value: Moving image archives, like other cultural institutions with significant heritage holdings, can benefit tremendously from investing in the semantic definition of information found in their information databases. While commercial entities such as search engines and data providers have already embraced the opportunities that semantic search provides for resource discovery, most non-commercial entities are just beginning to do so. Thus, this research addresses the benefits and challenges of enriching and enhancing archival moving image records with semantically defined information via LD. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
K. K. Adu,2018,A multi-methods study exploring the role of stakeholders in the digital preservation environment: The case of Ghana,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the role of stakeholders in the digital preservation under the following key research questions: What are the levels of awareness of the volumes of digital material? What are the contributory factors for the growth of digital records and the types of information and communication technology products? Design/methodology/approach: With the convergence of questionnaire, documentary evidence, observation, interview and questionnaire, this paper aims to examine the state and role of stakeholders in the digital preservation environment. The adoption of the multi-methods approach to the study offered a panoramic view of the inquiry where the quantitative paradigm became the emphasis or the priority for the study, while the qualitative data set provided a secondary or supportive role. Findings: The study underscored the adoption of collaborative and participatory opportunities in the digital preservation environment and reinforced the concept of Open Data, which thrives on citizen’s trust, participation and collaboration (UN e-government survey, 2014). It further revealed lack of knowledge about the likely growth of digital material across the ministries and agencies and confirmed that government legislations have contributed to the increased demand for information and the growth of digital records. Originality/value: The study underlined two mutually exclusive concepts (collaboration and participation) as part of the strategies to ameliorate the digital preservation conundrum confronted by memory institutions in Ghana. The applications of these concepts as solutions to the digital preservation problems are novel and currently gaining prominence and acceptance within the archival community Their adoption in this study could not have come at a better time, particularly when public sector organizations are confronted with the challenge of preserving digital records. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

L. Bountouri; P. Gratz; F. Sanmartin,2018,Digital Preservation: How to Be Trustworthy,"The Publications Office of the European Union has started a project for the long-term preservation of its digital publications to a new digital archival repository that contains legislative collections (such as the Official Journal of the European Union, treaties, international agreements, etc.), non-legislative collections (such as general and scientific publications), master data (such as descriptive, technical and provenance metadata specifications) and other data (such as datasets and websites). With the aim of safeguarding EU digital publications without any alteration during their life cycle, we have decided to follow standards ISO 14721:2012 (Open Archival Information System) to define the model of our digital preservation system and ISO 16363:2012 to verify the trustworthiness of the digital archival repository. In this context, we will deal with the following issue: how can we be sure that a digital object is the same as when it was created and has not been altered during its life cycle, both before and after its ingestion to the repository? In other words, how can our digital archival repository be trusted? The basic actions of the Publications Office towards this direction are: (a) to define a digital preservation plan; (b) to define and preserve representation information (master data and other specifications); (c) to define the designated community and its monitor; (d) to define and implement digital preservation strategies such as fixity, maintaining a read-only archive, keeping two copies in different physical data centres, etc.; (e) to define and implement provenance metadata; and (f) to have a technology watch of formats, standards and digital preservation strategies. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018."
L. Gomes; L. Silva; O. R. P. Bellon,2018,Exploring RGB-D cameras for 3D reconstruction of cultural heritage: A new approach applied to brazilian baroque sculptures,"RGB-D cameras have a great potential to solve several problems arising during the digitization of objects, such as cultural heritage. Three-dimensional (3D) digital preservation is usually performed with the use of high-end 3D scanners, as the 3D points generated by this type of equipment are in average millimeter up to sub-millimeter accurate. The downside of 3D scanners, in addition to the high cost, is the infrastructure requirements. It requires its own source of energy, a large workspace with tripods, special training to calibrate and operate the equipment, and high acquisition time, potentially taking several minutes for capturing a single image. An alternative is the use of low-cost depth cameras that are easy to operate and only require connection to a laptop and a source of energy. There are several recent studies showing the potential of RGB-D sensors. However, they often exhibit errors when applied to a full 360 degrees 3D reconstruction setup, known as the loop closure problem. This kind of error accumulation is intensified by the lower accuracy and large volume of data generated by RGB-D cameras. This article proposes a complete methodology for 3D reconstruction based on RGB-D sensors. To mitigate the loop closure effect, a pairwise alignment method was developed. The proposed approach expands the connectivity graph connections in a pairwise alignment system, by automatically discovering new pairs of meshes with overlapping regions. Then the alignment is more evenly distributed over the aligned pairs, avoiding the loop closure problem of full 3D reconstructions. The experiments were performed on a collection of 30 artworks made by the Baroque artist Antonio Francisco Lisboa, known as Aleijadinho, as part of the Aleijadinho Digital project conducted in partnership with IPHAN (Brazilian National Institute for Cultural and Artistic Heritage) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Experimental results show 3D models that are favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods available in the literature using RGD-D sensors. The main contributions of this work are: A new method for 3D alignment dedicated to attenuate the RGB-D camera loop closure problem; the development and disclosure of a complete, practical solution for 3D reconstruction of artworks; and the construction of 3D digital models of an important and challenging collection of Brazilian cultural heritage, made accessible by a virtual museum. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."

This is a scientometrics study. In this regard, social network and co-word analysis methods were used. 554 research resources such as books, national and international journal papers, conference articles, and MA and Ph.D. theses in Iran up to 2013 were studied. Researcher made checklist was used to collect data. Also Gephi and VOSviewer softwares were used to visualize and analyze the subject networks. Researches in the field of DLs were classified into 10 research topics and 59 subtopics. Findings showed that evaluation"", ""digital content and collections"", ""architecture, systems, tools and technologies"", etc. are of higher frequency research topics. Also ""evaluation"", ""metadata"", ""content preservation and security"", etc. are the most central and core subtopics in subject networks. Moreover subtopics such as ""electronic publishing standards"", ""use of taxonomies to provide unified and organized access to various digital repositories"", ""digital preservation systems"", ""resource sharing"", etc. are research areas with little research attention in Iran. Also results reflect that little researches pay attention to the technical and experimental domains. This shows that domains co-occurrence structure with nearly two decades of studies in this field, compared with international studies, is not matured and correlation between clusters are little and unbalanced. © 2018 Iranian Research Institute for Scientific Information and Documentation.

It presents an analysis of the issues surrounding the authenticity of presumption of a born digital record, using the leave absence process produced at the Federal University of Santa Maria as a case study. Method. The research was based on the InterPARES Project methodology. The contexts analyzed were legal and administrative, provenance, procedures, documentation and technology, considering a resolution that approves the Guidelines for the Presumption of Archival Digital Document Authenticity. Results. The case analyzed it is a computerized system used in the leave of absence process of teachers and technical and administrative staff in education. More than seventeen thousand documents have produced exclusively in digital media since the system came into operation in late 2012. Conclusions. The computerization contributed to the active transparency and reduced the time processing of the process, but the lack of compliance with some archival management requirements that falls on the digital born documents can generate uncertainty about the process authenticity, as well as the risk of losing part of long-term university's memory. © 2018 University of Pittsburgh.

M. Lee; S. Chen; Y. Zhang; E. Spencer; R. Marciano,2018,Toward identifying values and tensions in designing a historically-sensitive data platform: A case-study on urban renewal,"Urban renewal was a national initiative from the 1960s through the 70s aimed at improving so-called “blighted” areas, and resulted in the displacement of many vibrant communities. While the underlying mechanisms of urban renewal have been examined, there have been very few data-driven, evidence-based studies that take into account the histories and interests of former residents. The “Human Face of Big Data” project started as a digital curation effort to design and develop a web-based platform that provides insights and analytics into the mechanisms of this process. However, it was found from user feedback that designing these kinds of platforms is not trivial; rather it needed to be carefully approached as diverse values and tensions exist surrounding the design of a historically-sensitive data system. This paper aims to report on the initial system design process, and provide a preliminary design framework constructed using a top-down approach. This framework can be used to examine possible dimensions of design concerns for historically-sensitive data platforms by system designers. Also, human-computer interaction (HCI) and archival science researchers can potentially benefit from this new perspective that considers both value sensitivity and archival values. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018."

M. R. De Giusti; G. L. Villarreal,2018,Revision of different implementations for digital preservation: Towards a methodological proposal for preserving and auditing ir reliability,"This work introduces the initial experience of an infrastructure for digital documents preservation in archives or repositories. Prior backgrounds of similar infraestructures are recognized in this work, and among them three successful experiences are described. These experiences are all aimed to connect a digital repository with different software tools able to ensure digital preservation of repository contents according to OAIS ISO 14721 standard (2012). After the description of the three models, we describe a prototype under development in the repositories supported by PREBI-SEDICI (UNLP), which uses the software tools DSpace, Archivematica and ArchivesSpace. In this prototype, DSpace handles the ingest and delivery of digital contents, while Archivematica performs all the required digital preservation activities. This is achieved through a set of microservices applied to a conceptual structure similar to the information package (IP) in its differents versions (SIP, AIP, DIP). The resulting structure of the IP includes checksums, original files, logs, transfer documentation and XML metadata. The main purpose of this work is to show the background activities already carried out in institutions around the world, and to start a research project aiming to generate ideas and thoughts in the Latin American context. © RDBCI: Rev.

Hughes,2018,Digital preservation archives – a new future architecture for long-term interoperability,"Long-term digital preservation methods are critical practices to preserve the benefits of space missions for the mission customers and our society as a whole. In this paper we provide some background on the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model (RM) approach developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) and adopted by archives world-wide. Then we introduce as a new concept a Data Archive Architecture component called the OAIS Interoperability Framework (OAIS-IF); a software architecture suite of standards that will support the OAIS and add capabilities for interoperability between users and all archives that comply with the OAIS-IF standards. The plan for this data architecture for digital archives consists of a framework that remains relatively consistent, with unique plug-in drivers (APIs or protocols) that adapt the framework to each unique archive. The upper framework provides consistent user interfaces for the producers and consumers of the OAIS archive data. The middle framework is an Archive Abstraction Layer (AAL) whose function is to hide the implementation details (the mechanics of a specific archive’s characteristics) to facilitate interoperability and archive platform independence. Finally, the lower framework consists of specific plug-in drivers that connect the framework to each archive. We envision that there would be a specific plug-in driver for (for example) each of various mission functions (telemetry, spacecraft housekeeping, engineering/enterprise data), or for each of various scientific disciplines (astronomy, earth observing, materials research, genomic research, etc.). The result is a capability for interoperability between users and the many archives that will eventually subscribe to these standards. If the OAIS-IF achieves ubiquitous acceptance by digital preservation archives, the result will be improved cross-discipline and long-term accessibility, clearly benefiting the goals of long-term digital preservation and the goals of our spaceflight missions. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The acquisition of this kind of literature is not a simple process due to the unconventional distribution channels and the cost. For this purpose TIB has its own grey literature acquisition team. In order to keep the data readable and accessible in the long term TIB hosts, administrates and runs a digital preservation system which manages different kind of objects and file formats. Each group of objects needs its own workflow and ingest preparation (pre-ingest). This also applies to grey literature. Some of the grey literature publications are delivered on USB-flash-drives. In order to catalog them the USB-flash-drive will be accessed by librarians several times. As USB-flash-drives are “write-many” storage devices, accidental write or erase processes could already take place during the access by initially connecting with a PC. This fact leads to the risk of loss or overwriting of rare and expensive data. Furthermore, the lifespan of this data storage and the interface dependency are two remaining basic concerns of their long term accessibility in libraries. The minimization of risks of accidental manipulation by direct access to the USB-flash-drives can be achieved through the use of a USB write blocker. This device prevents all write instructions and ensures the safe forensic data transfer. The secure storage of the data from the USB-flash-drive can be done through the separation of data from the storage device. For this purpose TIB has developed a reusable, semi-automated workflow with a strong focus on usability for librarians. Using a script and the write blocker, that prevents the accidental write accesses, the workflow saves the data from USB flash devices via imaging or copying. This project consists of a market survey (4 person-days), implementation (28 person-days), tests (4 person-days) and launch in team (1 person-days). The price of the write blocker is 500$. The main focus of the paper is the detailed description of the project including its technical implementation, discussion of the results and further improvements. © 2018 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

O. P. Saini,2018,Understanding the role of institutional repository in digital preservation in academic libraries: A review of literature,"One of the leading objectives of the libraries is to provide the latest and timely information to its clientele and keep them updated with the new arrivals related to their subject areas. However, a limited storage capacity of libraries is throwing a challenge before librarians from the beginning of libraries. The latest developments in the libraries for information management, preservation, and dissemination involve a high rate of computer technologies. Institutional Repository (IR) is a new breed which has the potential to store any amount of information in little space and preserve it for a long-term perspective. Therefore, many of the academic libraries are enforced to develop their Institutional Repositories (IRs). The present study has started to find the solution to the burning problems before the academic libraries especially for planning, establishing, and maintaining the IRs for digital preservation. It is observed that the library managers are often confused when they asked to create IRs, design IR policy, motivated faculty, prepare budget estimates, etc. The study also covered various theoretical aspects related to the creation and maintenance of an IR in an academic environment and attempt to provide an understanding of digital preservation. The available literature about the significance of the IRs has revealed that the IRs are the need of the hour to showcase the research output of an institution. It does not only help to enhance the visibility of the intellectual work of faculties and researchers, but also support the scholarly communication among the academic community. © 2018 Library Philosophy and Practice."
P. Dawson; A. Farrokhi; A. Rowe; F. Baradaran; D. Lichti,2018,"Digital preservation, social history, and the Quon Sang Lung Laundry building: a case study from Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada","Social history focuses on understanding the everyday lives of ordinary people (Richardson 2011, Social history, local history, and historiography: collected essays). The ethnic minorities that made up immigrant communities in North American towns and cities during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have been of particular interest to social historians (Tosh 2017, From the ‘cape of despair’ to the Cape of Good Hope: letters of the emigrant poor in early nineteenth-century England. Social History 42:480–500). However, language barriers and low rates of literacy often limit the number of first person accounts written by people who belonged to such communities. This paper explores how terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and 3D reconstructive modeling of heritage buildings can provide new insights into the social history of Chinese immigrants in Alberta during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These technologies were used to rapidly and accurately document the Quon Sang Lung Laundry shop in Fort Macleod, Alberta, prior to its scheduled demolition. The resulting digital data sets were used to construct detailed architectural plans of the building, as well as photorealistic 3D reconstructions of the shop, as it would have appeared at different points in history. The resulting point clouds were further explored to detect and extract evidence of the lived experiences of its occupants. For example, the conflicts and tensions surrounding Chinese laundries, and the discriminatory bylaws that resulted, may be subtly reflected in specific architectural details of the laundry shop, such as evidence for the presence of walls no longer standing. The ability to return to accurate digital models, over and over again, provides unique opportunities to construct social histories of buildings long after they are gone. © 2018, Crown."
P. Decker; A. Christian; W. E. R. Xylander,2018,VIRMISCO - The Virtual Microscope Slide Collection,"Digitisation allows scientists rapid access to research objects. For transparent to semi-transparent three-dimensional microscopic objects, such as microinvertebrates or small body parts of organisms, available databases are scarce. Most mounting media used for permanent microscope slides deteriorate after some years or decades, eventually leading to total damage and loss of the object. However, restoration is labour-intensive, and often the composition of the mounting media is not known. A digital preservation of important material, especially types, is important and an urgent need. The Virtual Microscope Slide Collection - VIRMISCO project has developed recommendations for taking microscopic image stacks of three-dimensional objects, depositing and presenting such series of digital image files or z-stacks as an online platform. The core of VIRMISCO is an online viewer, which enables the user to virtually focus through an object online as if using a real microscope. Additionally, VIRMISCO offers features such as search, rotating, zooming, measuring, changing brightness or contrast, taking snapshots, leaving feedback as well as downloading complete z-stacks as jpeg files or video file. The open source system can be installed by any institution and can be linked to common database or images can be sent to the Senckenberg Museum of Natural History Gorlitz. The benefits of VIRMISCO are the preservation of important or fragile material, to avoid loan, to act as a digital archive for image files and to allow determination by experts from the distance, as well as providing reference libraries for taxonomic research or education and providing image series as online supplementary material for publications or digital vouchers of specimens of molecular investigations are relevant applications for VIRMISCO."

The main objective of this study is to ascertain the strategies used by the University libraries in Nigeria to preserve electronic records. The study employed descriptive research design. The population comprises one hundred and sixty nine (169) librarians from university libraries in Nigeria. Simple random sampling technique was used and the instrument for data collection is semi-structured closed and open-ended questionnaire. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics, charts with simple percentages. Statistical Package for Social Science version 22 are used for data analysis. The findings of the study revealed that ((x) over bar =1.63 +/- SD = 0.660) majority of university libraries in Nigeria do not have in place preservation strategies for electronic information records. 94.1% of librarians do not possess requites skills for preserving electronic information records. Lack of manpower and other infrastructure are identified as the major inhibiting factors ((x) over bar =3.90 +/- SD = 0.418). The study also found out that there is a significant relationship inhibiting factors of preservation and preservation strategies adopted by university library staff in Nigeria (r=-0.305, N=169 and P <0.01)."

Peters,2018,"Migration experiences: Acknowledging the past, and sustaining the present and future","Australia is recognised as one of the world’s most culturally and ethnically diverse nations. Immigration has historically played an important role in the nation’s economic, social and cultural development. There is a pressing need to find innovative technological and archival approaches to deal with the challenge to digitally preserve Australia’s migrant heritage, especially given the ageing of the European communities that were the first to come under the postwar mass migration scheme. This paper reports on plans for a national collaborative project to develop the foundational infrastructure for a dynamic, interoperable, migrant data resource for research and education. The Migration Experiences platform will connect and consolidate heterogeneous collections and resources and will provide an international exemplar underscoring the importance of digital preservation of cultural heritage and highlighting the opportunities new technologies can offer. The platform will widen the scope and range of the interpretative opportunities for researchers, and foster international academic relationships and networks involving partner organisations (universities, libraries, museums, archives and genealogical institutions). In doing so, it will contribute to better recognition and deeper understanding of the continuing role played by immigrants in Australia’s national story. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."

Study case of the medieval wall of avila (Spain),"The integration of the fourth dimension into the geospatial data allows to generate a diachronic model of Cultural Heritage (CH) assets, namely, a set of 3D models to represent it in various historical phases. This kind of reconstruction pursues a better understanding of the CH site/scenario, enriching the historical hypotheses as well as contributing to the conservation and decision-making process. Although the new geotechnologies have reduced the amount of fieldwork, the generation of 4D model implies the interpretation of heterogeneous historical information sources and their integration. However, this situation could reach a critical point when the study elements are no longer present. Their reconstruction will allow the digital preservation and maintenance of our culture. The main challenge is to harmonize the different historical and archaeological data sources available in relation with the current remains, to recover the lost CH assets with a high degree of reliability. This manuscript aims to examine the study case of a diachronic reconstruction by means of the use of the geotechnology Mobile Laser System (MLS) and reverse engineering techniques for a lost urban CH element, the citadel or Alcázar Gate of Ávila. Within this aim, the derived product is evaluated in terms of the achieved accuracy to assess its suitability on the basis of constructive interpretations required to integrate the historical sources in relation to current remains and the surrounding. © Authors 2018.

R. de Lima; M. Vergauwen; Ieee,2018,"From TLS Recoding to VR Environment for Documentation of the Governor's Tombs in Dayr al-Barsha, Egypt","The governors tombs located at Dayr al-Barsha are ranked among the most important heritage sites of the Egyptian Middle Kingdom. Unfortunately, the site underwent transformations and was affected by ancient quarrying, looting, and natural disasters such as earthquakes, thus bringing this archaeological site on the edge of ruin. For this reason, its digital documentation is important and valuable for the preservation and further study of this elite cemetery. This paper describes the work-flow towards the 3D digital recording and full immerse visualization of the monuments that compose this ancient site. These stages include the physical recording using Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS), the creation of realistic 3D models from the acquired data, and the creation of a Virtual Reality (VR) world of the most paramount burial monument of this archaeological area. The obtained digital representation of the site will not only serve as a basis for geoarchaeological surveying and analysis, but also as a digital tool for public disclosure of the archaeological remains."
R. E. Suri; M. El-Saad,2018,Lost in migration: document quality for batch conversion to PDF/A,"Purpose: Changes in file format specifications challenge long-term preservation of digital documents. Digital archives thus often focus on specific file formats that are well suited for long-term preservation, such as the PDF/A format. Since only few customers submit PDF/A files, digital archives may consider converting submitted files to the PDF/A format. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors evaluated three software tools for batch conversion of common file formats to PDF/A-1b: LuraTech PDF Compressor, Adobe Acrobat XI Pro and 3-HeightsTM Document Converter by PDF Tools. The test set consisted of 80 files, with 10 files each of the eight file types JPEG, MS PowerPoint, PDF, PNG, MS Word, MS Excel, MSG and “web page.” Findings: Batch processing was sometimes hindered by stops that required manual interference. Depending on the software tool, three to four of these stops occurred during batch processing of the 80 test files. Furthermore, the conversion tools sometimes failed to produce output files even for supported file formats: three (Adobe Pro) up to seven (LuraTech and 3-HeightsTM) PDF/A-1b files were not produced. Since Adobe Pro does not convert e-mails, a total of 213 PDF/A-1b files were produced. The faithfulness of each conversion was investigated by comparing the visual appearance of the input document with that of the produced PDF/A-1b document on a computer screen. Meticulous visual inspection revealed that the conversion to PDF/A-1b impaired the information content in 24 of the converted 213 files (11 percent). These reproducibility errors included loss of links, loss of other document content (unreadable characters, missing text, document part missing), updated fields (reflecting time and folder of conversion), vector graphics issues and spelling errors. Originality/value: These results indicate that large-scale batch conversions of heterogeneous files to PDF/A-1b cause complex issues that need to be addressed for each individual file. Even with considerable efforts, some information loss seems unavoidable if large numbers of files from heterogeneous sources are migrated to the PDF/A-1b format. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
R. King,2018,Personal digital archiving for journalists: a “private” solution to a public problem,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to encourage librarians to teach digital archiving practices to journalists as a way of giving journalists the skills they need to save their work for future use and to facilitate the preservation of journalism for posterity. Design/methodology/approach: The author has reviewed the personal digital archiving literature and analyzed how it might be specifically tailored to the unique needs of journalists. Findings: Daily journalism has traditionally been preserved by libraries in the form of newspapers and magazines housed in library periodicals departments. Now that nearly all journalism is published online and libraries generally only have access via temporary subscriptions, libraries are prevented from doing any kind of traditional preservation work (e.g. storing copies locally). In the future, this lack of local preservation may lead to a shortage of early twenty-first century primary source material for historians. Research limitations/implications: The needs of journalists do vary greatly based on the nature and format of their work and its publication venue, making it difficult to offer a single set of standards or recommendations. Originality/value: While personal digital archiving advocates have generally interpreted the word “personal” to be synonymous with “private,” this paper points to the need to expand the concept to include professional activities, particularly in light of the prevalence of telecommuting and freelance work arrangements, and the lack of support and training received by remote workers and independent contractors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
R. Marcelin Jimenez; R. B. Silva Lopez; F. J. Hernandez Olvera,2018,THE ROAD TO THE LIBRARY OF BABEL OR HOW TO MANAGE LARGE DIGITAL COLLECTIONS,"We present a tool and a model for digital collections management that can be deployed on any situation concerning the utilization of large catalogs. This approach can be applied not only for scientific repositories, but also on any organization requiring the management of collections that encompass a massive amount of digital resources. Our proposal is based on the communication between DSpace and Babel. DSpace is an open source repository software typically used for creating open access repositories for published digital contents, mostly scholar collections. While it shares some features that overlap with content management systems and document management systems, the DSpace repository software serves a specific need as a digital archiving system, focused on catalogue support and rapid document retrieval. In turn, the Babel Storage System is a dependable, scalable and flexible software defined storage system. Among its main features it can be underlined the availability of different types of data redundancy, a careful decoupling between data and metadata, a middleware that enforces metadata consistency, and its own load-balance and allocation procedure which adapts to the number and capacities of the supporting storage devices. It can be deployed over different hardware platforms, i.e. it is fully hardware-agnostic."

Singh,2018,Digital Curation of a World War II Japanese-American Incarceration Camp Collection: Implications for Sociotechnical Archival Systems,"We describe computational treatments of archival collections through a case study of World War II Japanese-American Incarceration Camps. Camp staff and police officers compiled so-called internal security"" reports relating to alleged cases of ""disorderly conduct, assault, theft, loss of property, and accidents"" in the camps, and an index to these reports comprising over 25,000 index cards to the reports. The sheer size of these collections is pushing archivists and researchers to consider new forms of processing for collections at scale. We discuss novel digital treatments that involve (1) processing incident cards at scale in an automated way, (2) preserving and documenting the record series and their operations using an Archival Information Package (AIP), and (3) developing social network-based archiving, analysis, and visualization of the col-lection. Since this type of project involves multiple partnerships, agreements, and social interactions with community groups and public-sector organizations, we discuss the possibility of the concept of sociotechnical archival systems as an implication of our approach. © 2018 IEEE."""
R. Marciano; V. Lemieux; M. Hedges; M. Esteva; W. Underwood; M. Kurtz; M. Conrad,2018,Archival records and training in the age of big data,"Purpose – For decades, archivists have been appraising, preserving, and providing access to digital records by using archival theories and methods developed for paper records. However, production and consumption of digital records are informed by social and industrial trends and by computer and data methods that show little or no connection to archival methods. The purpose of this chapter is to reexamine the theories and methods that dominate records practices. The authors believe that this situation calls for a formal articulation of a new transdiscipline, which they call computational archival science (CAS). Design/Methodology/Approach – After making a case for CAS, the authors present motivating case studies: (1) evolutionary prototyping and computational linguistics; (2) graph analytics, digital humanities, and archival representation; (3) computational finding aids; (4) digital curation; (5) public engagement with (archival) content; (6) authenticity; (7) confluences between archival theory and computational methods: cyberinfrastructure and the records continuum; and (8) spatial and temporal analytics. Findings – Each case study includes suggestions for incorporating CAS into Master of Library Science (MLS) education in order to better address the needs of today’s MLS graduates looking to employ “traditional” archival principles in conjunction with computational methods. A CAS agenda will require transdisciplinary iSchools and extensive hands-on experience working with cyberinfrastructure to implement archival functions. Originality/Value – We expect that archival practice will benefit from the development of new tools and techniques that support records and archives professionals in managing and preserving records at scale and that, conversely, computational science will benefit from the consideration and application of archival principles. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

R. Rydén,2018,Extreme long-term preservation of information - Who cares? Swedish opinions about nuclear waste information,"Introduction. Information concerning a planned repository for nuclear waste in Sweden needs to be preserved for future generations in ways that make it available and comprehensible up to 100,000 years from now. This paper examines current planning for information preservation and opinions on the issue expressed by a variety of interested parties. Method. A literature overview outlines the major strategies for preservation of information related to nuclear waste forwarded in international research. Documents concerning the industry’s plans for information preservation were collected. Consultation responses concerning the application submitted by universities, government agencies and environmental organizations were also collected and examined. Analysis. The first document study elucidates the industry’s application and plans for information preservation in relation to current research in the field. The second document study clarifies opinions on the issue expressed by the various participants in the consultation process. Results. The Swedish nuclear industry has a relatively high awareness of strategies for information preservation forwarded by researchers. Planning is however limited to maintaining a readiness for later decisions. With a few exceptions, other interested parties keep a low profile and comment only on technical matters. Conclusions. Societal interest in the issue of long-term information preservation is generally low. A tentative explanation is that the extreme time-scale involved makes the problem difficult to grasp. The equally long-term technological and geological problems are easier to discuss since they do not demand knowledge of the future development of human society. © 2018, University of Boras.

R. Varniene-Janssen; J. Kupriene,2018,Authenticity and provenance in long-term digital preservation: Analysis of the scope of content,"Authenticity is a fundamental issue for the long-term preservation of digital objects; however, the validation of authenticity is a complex task - it requires the representation of provenance as a precondition for trust. For that matter, it is crucial to define the key conceptual elements that provide the foundation for such a complex framework. The main objective of this paper is to define how authenticity has to be managed in the digital preservation process: to identify the semantic units needed to support core preservation functions in order to ensure the trustworthiness of digital objects and ensure interoperability - i.e., the ability to exchange data between institutions. This paper presents results from the first stage of the research: the scope of authenticity and provenance content needed to support core preservation functions and ensure interoperability - the ability to exchange data between institutions and assess the added value of the Europeana and VEPIS regarding authenticity and provenance based on the adequacy of analyzed international models for authenticity and provenance. Methodology: by applying the EU 2-3-6 concept of added value for electronic publishing and qualitative content analysis of research literature, we conceptualized the Content Creation Process, which refers to the structure and meaning of authenticity and provenance.

Boscolo,2018,Improving Forest Land Governance: The Case of Developing a Digital Archiving System for Forest Land Records in Bangladesh,"Land administration in Bangladesh relies significantly on paper-based records which are stored in multiple government offices. This deters public access to land records that breeds inefficiencies. This article assesses the anticipated impacts and challenges of a digital archiving system for the forest land records on the land governance in Bangladesh. The system is expected to contribute to improving land administration and governance in the country by, (i) permanently preserving forest land records, (ii) helping resolve land disputes and fight land grabbing, and (iii) improving the accessibility and transparency of these documents. However, lack of adequate funding and skilled manpower pose challenges to the sustainability and scaling up of undertaken digitization and archiving initiatives. Thus, the capacity for forest land administration should be strengthened.

Although certain subdisciplines of biology have pioneered efforts to ensure their long-term preservation and facilitate collaborations, data continue to disappear, owing mostly to technological, regulatory, and ideological hurdles. In this article, we describe the important steps toward proper data management and archiving and provide a critical discussion on the importance of long-term data conservation. We then illustrate the rise in data archiving through the Joint Data Archiving Policy and the Dryad Digital Repository. In particular, we discuss data integration and how the limited availability of large-scale data sets can hinder new discoveries. Finally, we propose solutions to increase the rate of data preservation, for example by generating mechanisms insuring proper data management and archiving, by providing training in data management, and by transforming the traditional role of research institutions and libraries as data generators toward managers and archivers."
S. S. Atanda,2018,Digital preservation challenges in Nigeria libraries: Awareness of challenges of digital preservation in Nigeria libraries – librarians’ perspective,"The population consists of 172 participants that were presence at 2nd Conference of Certified Librarians by Librarians’ Registration Council of Nigeria held in Abuja, 2015.The instrument used to generate data is the questionnaire and data generated was analyzed using frequency, bar charts, percentages and mean. The outcome of the study revealed that many librarians do not have training on digital preservation management despite the awareness of digital preservation challenges. The findings revealed major challenges such as hardware and software obsolesces, lack of training, lack of backup/standard, lack of strategy policy, lack of fund and lack of legal right. Recommendations were made to protect and safeguard digital preservation challenges in the libraries. Such as training and retraining of librarians on new technology/trend in managing library digital content, software and hardware technology should be improved, Nigerian Library Association (NLA) should create a standard policy and ensure compliance by all libraries for them to enjoy increased funding.

S. Sugimoto; W. Monika; S. Kiryakos; T. Mihara; C. Wijesundara; M. Nagamori,2018,Metadata models for organizing digital archives on the web: Metadata-centric projects at tsukuba and lessons learned,"There exist many digital collections of cultural and historical resources, referred to as digital archives in this paper. Domains of digital archives are expanding from traditional cultural heritage objects to new areas such as popular culture and intangible entities. Though it is known that metadata models and authority records, such as subject vocabularies, are essential in building digital archives, they are not yet well established in these new domains. Another crucial issue is semantic linking among resources within a digital archive and across digital archives. Metadata aggregation is an essential aspect for the resource linking. This paper overviews three metadata-centric on-going research projects by the authors and discusses some lessons learned from them. The subject domains of these research projects are disaster records of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, Japanese popular culture such as Manga, Anime and Games, and cultural heritage resources in South and Southeast Asia. The main goal of this paper is not to report on these projects as completed research, but to discuss issues of metadata models and aggregation which are important in organizing digital archives in the web-based information environment. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

S. VanSnick; K. Ntanos,2018,On Digitisation as a Preservation Measure,"While access and engagement are usually the primary objectives of digitisation projects, they often also claim to benefit the long-term preservation of collection items due to reducing handling, one of the main risks to archival and library collections, making this a persuasive additional argument to invest in digitising a collection. Conservation intervention prior to digitisation, if done, is kept to minimum repair, cleaning and flattening of documents in order to achieve high-quality images, facilitate safe handling and ensure efficient workflow. Such preservation improvements may be negated by continued access to the physical records after digitisation has occurred. There is also a risk of damage during the digitisation process, especially for very fragile items, for which digitisation may nonetheless be the only way to provide future access. This paper assesses archival document request data before and after digitisation, and online access options, for a selection of digitisation projects from The National Archives, UK, in order to review of the effectiveness of a number of digitisation programmes in reducing demand for handling of originals. It identifies procedural improvements post-digitisation that would further reduce access to original documents. © 2018, © The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works 2018."

S.-A. Tomescu,2018,"Blended Learning Methodology for Library Professionals Carol I"" Central University Library""","The present paper aims to analyze the current mission of Carol I"" Central University Library for library professionals' training and development. We started our methodology from the services and scientific products that these institutions offer to higher education researchers, teachers and students, the extent of the technological developments and (co) relation with the assimilated skills. Taking into account the new tendencies in heritage preservation and cultural sharing through the new tech, dedicated portals and communication channels, library professionals must be specialized in digital technology processing, metadata cataloguing, bibliographic data exchange, digital preservation and data analyzing. Unfortunately, the Romanian library system lacks a well guided training policy, a nationwide unified strategy for digital preservation and also a public strategy for professional training. Our study will focus on how ""Carol I"" Central University Library, Bucharest understands its unique role of training provider for secondary school library system and also of the academic library system. The librarian profession addresses to a different public, has specific tasks and levels of difficulty, being influenced by the organizational evolution and technical infrastructure. They are also confronted with economic constraints and need to develop the expertise and adjust the library services and scientific products (eBooks, e-portfolios, digital repositories, eLearning platforms) through electronic means of communication, theoretical expertise and sociological tools in order to accomplish the fundamental mission of the institution (to support teaching, learning and scientific research) at highest academic standards. The teaching and learning processes have been transformed rapidly the last decades due to the shifting evolution of communication channels and educational software. Blended Learning as new paradigm became a very appropriate solution for knowledge transfer. The evolution of library services and new strategies for learning and communications required a strong set of specific skills for librarians. In this respect, having as mission to develop the competences of both academic and school librarians, ""Carol I"" Central University Library might use a common training curriculum for the basic working skills. The purpose of our analysis is to explore the need for blended learning and its influences in the academic environment, highlighting the librarians' training policies. We designed a virtual learning environment dedicated to the professional training, with Moodle, in order to provide professional guidance for librarians, and also applied the last theoretical fundamentals of blending learning in the librarianship field, comparative case studies concerning electronic library services. In this regard, we explored the possible technological foundation that might be used to design a pedagogical model for librarians' blended training framework. This is the reason behind ""Carol I"" Central University Library, as the only national training provider for two library systems, took into consideration the blended learning as a cost effective solution for knowledge sharing, continuous development and professional solidarity."""
T. Coughlin,2018,9 Years of Media and Entertainment Digital Storage Surveys,"Digital storage plays a significant role in the professional media and entertainment industry. Digital storage for the ME industry has demanding characteristics often very different from typical IT storage, because of the performance requirements of real-time video in capture, editing and post-production as well as distribution. These trends are driving demand for flash memory in post-production as well as content delivery. On the other hand, the growing archive of long-tail digital content and increasing digitized historical analog content is swelling the demand for cold as well as warm archives using tape, optical discs and hard drive arrays. The growth of IP based workflows is driving demand for block, file and object storage for various ME applications. As a result, the prices of digital storage have declined. At the same time the availability of digital storage hardware, software and on-line services has increased. This brings up the question of what sort of storage systems and services ME professionals require for various parts of their workflows. What drives their storage decisions and how are these demands changing over time? Coughlin Associates, Inc. has been conducting a survey of Media and Entertainment professionals from all over the world on various digital storage topics for nine years. The surveys were broken down into several usage segments to reflect broad differences in storage requirements, these were: content capture, editing and post-production, content delivery as well as archiving and digital preservation. Results from the nine years of the survey will be compared to show changing storage trends for these various ME applications including storage capacity growth, cloud storage; flash memory, hard disk drive, tape and optical disc demand. These surveys served as a basis for our annual Digital Storage in Media and Entertainment report and some projections on the drivers and growth of digital storage will give insights on the future of digital storage for the media and entertainment industry. © 2018 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc."

Carved decorations as well as inscriptions are slowly vanishing, and rarely preserved detached fragments of decorations are scattered around sites and museums. It is about the right time to try to find a solution against the degradation of these monuments and preserve the information about this kind of Etruscan rock art. This study examines a multi-image photogrammetry as a tool for the documentation, digital preservation and archaeological analysis of the tomb facades, which is based on increased readability of worked surface and other actions which allows a virtual environment. Furthermore, the advantages, disadvantages, possibilities and limitations of this technique applied on this specific kind of rock art are evaluated. Moreover, I explore new ways of the further use of acquired data in virtual reconstruction and virtual anastylosis. . © Archaeopress and the authors 2018. All rights reserved."

V. Navale; M. McAuliffe,2018,Long-term preservation of biomedical research data,"Genomics and molecular imaging, along with clinical and translational research have transformed biomedical science into a data-intensive scientific endeavor. For researchers to benefit from Big Data sets, developing long-term biomedical digital data preservation strategy is very important. In this opinion article, we discuss specific actions that researchers and institutions can take to make research data a continued resource even after research projects have reached the end of their lifecycle. The actions involve utilizing an Open Archival Information System model comprised of six functional entities: Ingest, Access, Data Management, Archival Storage, Administration and Preservation Planning. We believe that involvement of data stewards early in the digital data life-cycle management process can significantly contribute towards long term preservation of biomedical data. Developing data collection strategies consistent with institutional policies, and encouraging the use of common data elements in clinical research, patient registries and other human subject research can be advantageous for data sharing and integration purposes. Specifically, data stewards at the onset of research program should engage with established repositories and curators to develop data sustainability plans for research data. Placing equal importance on the requirements for initial activities (e.g., collection, processing, storage) with subsequent activities (data analysis, sharing) can improve data quality, provide traceability and support reproducibility. Preparing and tracking data provenance, using common data elements and biomedical ontologies are important for standardizing the data description, making the interpretation and reuse of data easier. The Big Data biomedical community requires scalable platform that can support the diversity and complexity of data ingest modes (e.g. machine, software or human entry modes). Secure virtual workspaces to integrate and manipulate data, with shared software programs (e.g., bioinformatics tools), can facilitate the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) use of data for near- and long-term research needs."

W. A. Bhat,2018,Long-term preservation of big data: prospects of current storage technologies in digital libraries,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the prospects of current storage technologies for long-term preservation of big data in digital libraries. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a systematic and critical review of the relevant literature to explore the prospects of current storage technologies for long-term preservation of big data in digital libraries. Online computer databases were searched to identify the relevant literature published between 2000 and 2016. A specific inclusion and exclusion criterion was formulated and applied in two distinct rounds to determine the most relevant papers. Findings: The study concludes that the current storage technologies are not viable for long-term preservation of big data in digital libraries. They can neither fulfil all the storage demands nor alleviate the financial expenditures of digital libraries. The study also points out that migrating to emerging storage technologies in digital libraries is a long-term viable solution. Research limitations/implications: The study suggests that continuous innovation and research efforts in current storage technologies are required to lessen the impact of storage shortage on digital libraries, and to allow emerging storage technologies to advance further and take over. At the same time, more aggressive research and development efforts are required by academics and industry to further advance the emerging storage technologies for their timely and swift adoption by digital libraries. Practical implications: The study reveals that digital libraries, besides incurring significant financial expenditures, will suffer from potential loss of information due to storage shortage for long-term preservation of big data, if current storage technologies are employed by them. Therefore, policy makers and practitioners should meticulously choose storage technologies for long-term preservation of big data in digital libraries. Originality/value: This type of holistic study that investigates the prospects of magnetic drive technology, solid-state drive technology, and data-reduction techniques for long-term preservation of big data in digital libraries has not been conducted in the field previously, and so provides a novel contribution. The study arms academics, practitioners, policy makers, and industry with the deep understanding of the problem, technical details to choose storage technologies meticulously, greater insight to frame sustainable policies, and opportunities to address various research problems. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Digital preservation is significant for cultural heritage since there are a lot of important knowledge and collections of manuscripts and artefacts which need to be preserved to ensure sustainability for future generations. However, there is still a lack in digital preservation methods for cultural heritage especially intangible cultural heritage. This paper discusses cultural heritage and results of a study on intangible cultural heritage preservation. An interview with five experts in intangible cultural heritage domain has been carried out. Results show that level of awareness of preserving intangible cultural heritage is still low. In addition, the heritage practitioners-artisans and craftsmen keep the knowledge and skills in their memory as preservation method.

The general objective of the research is to analyze the application of preservation strategies for the elaboration of a Plan of Preservation of the FERGS Archival Documentary Heritage. In order to subsidize this research, it was decided to carry out a data survey that identified archival policies on digital preservation and how it would be effective in the institutions, so that it would be possible to analyze the universe of said institution, FERGS. The result of this data collection, carried out in fifty-five Brazilian public institutions, showed that a good part of them, or about ninety-one percent, does not have an archival preservation digital policy and none of them has a Digital Preservation Plan To implement this policy. This shows that the public policies on digital preservation emanated by the National Archives are not being effectively implemented within the federal public institutions, corroborating the development of actions to improve this scenario. © 2018, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

Although tourists can easily acquire some information from digital archiving systems (DAS) through location-based services (LBS), they are unable to have an in-deep tour without understanding the data represented in three dimensions as time, space and topic. In recent years, spatial computing is proposed to transform the use of DAS from location-aware into location-understanding. Unfortunately, the application programming interface (API) of most DAS is not intuitive and inefficient to query the data stored in DAS. In this paper, we will present a three-dimensional data query system (3DQS) using the proposed API proxy mechanism. The contributions of proposed 3DQS include (1) providing a friendly API to query three-dimensional data in DAS, (2) caching data being requested, and (3) prefetching data according to the time, space, and topic localities predicted from users’ interests. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018."

X. Wang; H. Liu,2018,The “Living State” Research of China Non-material Cultural Heritage on Digital Age: Taking the Nanjing Jinling Sutra Office as an Example,"Intangible cultural heritage is considered as the basic identification mark of the nation for many nationalities. With the changes of the times and the development of science and technology, intangible cultural heritage programs of the traditional art and skill types with technique as the core have faded out of people’s lives even gradually demised because of the changes of social demand, the lacking of inheritors and inadequate protection. So how to protect and inherit the intangible cultural heritage and how to provide a driving force for its survival and development by design innovation under modern conditions? Nanjing Jinling Sutra Printing House, established in the fifth year of the Tongzhi Period (1866) and engaging in the gathering, collection, research and publishing of sutra, it has collected lots of precious sutra and statue engravings. Till now, the Printing House has collected 125,318 pieces of Buddhist classical engravings, completely protected and inherited traditional woodblock printing skill of China originated from over 1,300 years ago and formed a unique artistic style of books. The “Chinese woodblock printing technique”, represented by Nanjing Jinling Sutra Printing House, etc., was inscribed on the World Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by the UNESCO in 2009. Its book art has profoundly embodied the art symbol of traditional Chinese culture in the aspects of text and image, layout and binding, material and technology, etc., with unique aesthetic features of ancient Chinese art. Its master-to-apprentice mechanism of book art is even one of the representative methods and approaches of Chinese cultural and artistic inheritance. The woodblock printing of Jinling Sutra Printing House includes four manual procedures of sample writing, engraving, painting and binding. Wherein, writing and engraving have a high request on professional skills of the operators, which need a long-term training and cultivating mechanism of apprentice learning from master and oral teaching that inspires true understanding within. The aesthetic value embodied by manual engraving is the precious aspect of artistic style of books but also a shortage for the passing on of the woodblock printing art. For instance, the difficulty in cultivating professional talents, the accurate requests on one-time molding of engraving skills, the labor and time-consuming in product output efficiency, increasing space requirements on storage of woodblocks, technical requirements on long-term preservation of woodblocks (anti-damping, anti-moth, fire proofing) etc. Besides, there are only four masters and apprentices of three generations in Jinling Sutra Printing House at present, and two of whom are the only apprentices of their masters, talent training and technology inheritance are confronted with a great risk of uncertainty. Although woodblock printing plays an important role in the development and inheritance of China’s traditional culture and artistry, it still has equally prominent technical limitations. Therefore, how to conduct effective and living research on such intangible cultural heritage and use digital technology for its comprehensive protection and inheritance in the digital times has become a particularly necessary proposition. After preliminary research, the writer believes that the current protection and inheritance for intangible cultural heritage programs have the following patterns: first of all, inheriting the project originally; secondly, on the basis of original inheritance, thinking about how to combine the traditional skills with modern life, and how to integrate the intangible cultural heritage with times elements in innovative approaches, so that it can be inherited lively. The writer believes that, nowadays, living state is an important characteristic of China’s intangible cultural heritage. So, the development of contemporary intangible cultural heritage shall be effectively put into the market as a circulation commodity with higher added value and cultural value and inter ct and promote with the market to become a driving power and motive power for the development of social culture. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."
Y. B. Rachman; S. Afidhan,2018,Digital Disaster Preparedness of Indonesian Special Libraries,"The literature about disaster preparedness, especially digital disaster in the library, is particularly limited in Indonesia. With the growing number of library collections in digital form, it is important for libraries to implement strategies for the protection of digital collections from various disaster threats. The purpose of this study is to provide information on the readiness of selected special libraries in Indonesia on the issue of digital disaster. A questionnaire containing 15 closed and open-ended questions was disseminated through an online survey to 10 selected special libraries in Jakarta and Bogor, Indonesia. The results indicate that most libraries have implemented digital data protection and are able to analyze any potential digital disaster threats that may occur. Most of the libraries do not yet have specific policies regarding digital collections, however. The minimal number of digital collections compared to the number of printed collections is assumed to be the cause of the lack of attention and protection of digital collections. Consequently, libraries need to develop a digital preservation policy first before implementing a digital disaster management plan. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
Y. C. Lu; T. Y. Shih; Y. N. Yen,2018,Research on historic BIM of built heritage in Taiwan - A case study of Huangxi Academy,"Digital archiving technology for conserving cultural heritage is an important subject nowadays. The Taiwanese Ministry of Culture continues to try to converge the concept and technology of conservation towards international conventions. However, the products from these different technologies are not yet integrated due to the lack of research and development in this field. There is currently no effective schema in HBIM for Taiwanese cultural heritage. The aim of this research is to establish an HBIM schema for Chinese built heritage in Taiwan. The proposed method starts from the perspective of the components of built heritage buildings, up to the investigation of the important properties of the components through important international charters and Taiwanese laws of cultural heritage conservation. Afterwards, object-oriented class diagram and ontology from the scale of components were defined to clarify the concept and increase the interoperability. A historical database was then established for the historical information of components and to bring it into the concept of BIM in order to build a 3D model of heritage objects which can be used for visualization. An integration platform was developed for the users to browse and manipulate the database and 3D model simultaneously. In addition, this research also evaluated the feasibility of this method using the study case at the Huangxi academy located in Taiwan. The conclusion showed that class diagram could help the establishment of database and even its application for different Chinese built heritage objects. The establishment of ontology helped to convey knowledge and increase interoperability. In comparison to traditional documentation methods, the querying result of the platform was more accurate and less prone to human error. © Authors 2018. CC BY 4.0 License."
Y. Feng; L. Richards,2018,A review of digital curation professional competencies: theory and current practices,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the concept of professional competency in current digital curation literature through the lens of competency theories in management science and organizational studies. This paper also aims to provide recommendations to articulate and expand professional competencies in future digital curation research and professional education. Design/methodology/approach: The outcomes presented in this paper are based on a multi-disciplinary literature review and a qualitative content analysis. The literature review explores theoretical foundations of professional competency in management science and organizational studies and how the concept of professional competency is used in digital curation literature. The content analysis scrutinizes 16 digital curation publications that have discussed professional competency, with an in-depth examination of seven empirical studies in these publications. Findings: The findings include: the concept of professional competency is inconsistently used in digital curation literature, the digital curation literature exhibits disparate coverage of different types of professional competencies, and the digital curation empirical studies often narrowly operationalize the concept of professional competency but the empirical studies using multiple or in-depth qualitative methods yield more comprehensive findings reflecting a broader scope of the concept. Originality/value: Although past research focused on the competencies required for digital curation, there is no research scrutinizing the conceptual construct of professional competency in the digital curation literature. This paper will be of value to digital curation researchers and educators to better determine the competencies needed for digital curators as an emerging profession. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."
Y. Noda; S. Yanai; L. Li; K. Hasegawa; A. Okamoto; H. Yamaguchi; S. Tanaka,2018,Feature-Highlighting Transparent Visualization of Laser-Scanned Point Clouds Based on Curvature-Dependent Poisson Disk Sampling,"In recent years, with the development of 3D laser-measurement technology, digital archiving is being carried out as one of the efforts to leave cultural assets to posterity around the world. The laser-scanned point clouds are large-scale and precisely record complex 3D structures of the cultural assets. Accordingly, such point clouds are used in research field of visualization to support analysis and use of the assets. As representative examples of visualization, there are feature-highlighting and transparent visualization. The quality of visualization highly depends on distributional uniformity, that is, uniformity of inter-point distances. However, laser-scanned point clouds are usually distributional bias data, which makes it impossible to visualize with high quality. In previous studies, making point distances uniform by Poisson disk sampling, the quality of transparent visualization can be improved. This study proposes curvature-dependent Poisson disk sampling. The proposed method adjusts the order and radius of the sampling disk according to the curvature calculated by principal component analysis. By applying the proposed method to laser-scanned point clouds, the edges of cultural assets can be emphasized and the visibility of shape further improves in transparent visualization. Thereby, we realize feature-highlighting transparent visualization with high visibility of three-dimensional structure and edge-shape. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
Y. Tzitzikas; Y. Marketakis,2018,Cinderella's stick: A fairy tale for digital preservation,"This book explains the main problems related to digital preservation using examples based on a modern version of the well-known Cinderella fairy tale. Digital preservation is the endeavor to protect digital material against loss, corruption, hardware/software technology changes, and changes in the knowledge of the community. The structure of the book is modular, with each chapter consisting of two parts: the episode and the technical background. The episodes narrate the story in chronological order, exactly as in a fairy tale. In addition to the story itself, each episode is related to one or more digital preservation problems, which are discussed in the technical background section of the chapter. To reveal a more general and abstract formulation of these problems, the notion of pattern is used. Each pattern has a name, a summary of the problem, a narrative describing an attempt to solve the problem, an explanation of what could have been done to avoid or alleviate this problem, some lessons learned, and lastly, links to related patterns discussed in other chapters. The book is intended for anyone wanting to understand the problems related to digital preservation, even if they lack the technical background. It explains the technical details at an introductory level, provides references to the main approaches (or solutions) currently available for tackling related problems, and is rounded out by questions and exercises appropriate for computer engineers and scientists. In addition, the book's website, maintained by the authors, presents the contents of Cinderella's real USB stick,"" and includes links to various tools and updates. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

Preserving artwork and cultural objects is thus important and the focus of multiple institutions and governments around the world. Digital preservation in cultural heritage represents a cost-effective and reliable long-term preservation and several challenges related to its effectiveness and its reliability have arisen such as metadata enrichment, digital curation, link discoveries, etc. Through this paper, we discuss these challenges and present innovative ways that leverage recent endeavors in artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies to enrich cultural data. Our contributions mitigate these issues either by recovering metadata of mislabeled assets or curating their damaged visual capture through new and advanced deep learning and semantic web technologies.

Through AustLit's emphasis on contextualising individual works within cultural, biographical, and critical spaces, Australia's literary history is comprehensively represented in a unique digital humanities space. Within AustLit is BlackWords, a project dedicated to recording Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander storytelling, publishing, and literary cultural history, including children's and young adult texts. Children's literature has received significant attention in AustLit (and BlackWords) over the last decade through three projects that are documented in this paper. The curation of this data highlights the challenges in presenting 'national' literatures in countries where minority voices were (and perhaps continue to be) repressed and unseen. This paper employs a 'resourceful reading' approach - both close and distant reading methods - to trace the complex and ever-evolving definition of 'Australian children's literature'."

Digital preservation actions still faces considerable challenges in all its stages, the first being the formulation of institutional policies and other normative and procedural instruments needed for its implementation. A digital preservation plan aims to systematize the steps and procedures necessary to meet the minimum requirements for the preservation of digital objects in institutional repository. The Action Plan was developed following four steps: analysis of national and international guidelines and standards that guide digital preservation actions; definition of elements and structure of the document; diagnosis of the current state of the Arca repository in relation to the desired minimum elements; and definition of strategies to be adopted for the Arca repository. As a result, the Action Plan sets the standards that aim to ensure that scientific outputs by Fiocruz are permanently preserved, in a reliable and safe environment, and seeks to contribute to the theoretical and practical debate about digital preservation in repositories. © 2019, Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Understanding how complex digital objects evolve over time and how such objects are framed as changing objects allows us to develop a more nuanced model for how different kinds of changes function in the lives of complex digital objects. This paper analyzes several years of patch notes for the digital game League of Legends through the methodology of reading to construct categories of kinds of changes and interpret the different roles of those categories. We propose a taxonomy of changes to a key part of the game ecosystem and describe how the categories in this taxonomy limn a perspective on dynamic, complex digital objects that can lead to more nuanced and robust preservation efforts. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

My work concerns women's songs produced in Kotiria (fka Wanano/Guanano), an Eastern Tukanoan language spoken in the Upper Rio Negro. The data I use, collected by Janet Chernela, is “housed” electronically through the Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) at the University of Texas at Austin. This archive is part of Sherzer's lasting legacy—a legacy that is becoming part of indigenous peoples’ experiences of themselves as major producers of the discourses that represent them to the world. I describe how AILLA contributes to the ability of indigenous people and anthropologists to fruitfully negotiate the collection and analysis of matters of cultural, linguistic, and musical salience. I also describe how in the Kotiria case, the existence of AILLA has been fundamental to geographically dispersed relations among academics working with indigenous groups in the region. In this way, indigenous voices are able to enter new flows of meaning creation on both localized and more global levels. © 2019 American Anthropological Association"

Data was collected in three intervals over a two-year period: a web questionnaire about digital curation knowledge and skills and interest in continuing professional development (CPD); nine interviews with individuals who engaged in digital curation work about workplace challenges and CPD education; and a final online questionnaire about preferences for digital curation CPD education. Findings suggest that Ireland-specific issues emerged: (a) because there is so little understanding about digital curation in Ireland, even among information professionals, individuals were not always sure when they were doing digital curation work and if they needed to learn more and; (b) individuals were often the only ones in their institutions with digital curation skills and found themselves struggling to educate supervisors and colleagues about the necessity of their work as well as the resources needed to conduct their work. Considering these findings, comprehensive postgraduate digital curation education in Ireland would need to include a focus on these issues. © 2018, © 2018 Archives and Records Association."
A. Lecoq; J. Vincent; F. Zarndt; P. Song,2019,Digitizing and preserving the tuol sleng genocide museum archives: Stories of compromises in a challenging environment,"Stories of mass digitization projects and the preservation of those physical materials to be digitized often bring to mind well-equipped set ups in clean dust-free, air controlled rooms with highly skilled staff. One particularly thinks of this for museums and archives located in temperate-climate developed countries. But what about stories of digitization projects with limited resources in less than optimum environments, how does one envision those? The Archives of Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (TSGM) [1] is the largest and most complete record of Khmer Rouge actions during the Democratic Kampuchea (DK) regime. [2] The Archives contain forced “confessions”, many extracted under torture; biographies of prisoners, guards and officials; photographs; original negatives; and other paper-based bound materials. Many items are very fragile and were not created with long-term preservation in mind so when handled for research they are at risk. The first Archive team did not record the provenance of the documents so research and recreating history is a challenge. In addition these records are not easily accessible for most Cambodians. For these reasons, and because the climate in Phnom Penh is hot and humid preservation is much harder than in more temperate climates, UNESCO and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) have provided funds to digitize the Museum’s archives. With these funds and under direction from UNESCO experts, along with the support of the Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts (MoCFA), Digital Divide Data and Brechin Imaging are collaborating to preserve and digitize the Archives and to train the Tuol Sleng staff in digitization and preservation. Once ingested into the Project’s database and crowd-sourcing website, which is currently being developed, these records will help illuminate the stories of people caught in this dark period of Cambodian history for the next generations. © 2019 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

This paper is reporting the findings from a multiyear study entitled Data curator: Who is s/he?"" initiated by the Library Theory and Research (LTR) Section of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). The study aimed to identify the roles and responsibilities of data curators around the world and also focused on the terminology used to describe the new professional roles. The following questions were posed: R1: How is data curation defined by practitioners/professional working in the field? R2: What terms are used to describe the roles for professionals in data curation area? R3: What are primary roles and responsibilities of data curators? R4: What are educational qualifications and competencies required of data curators? To answer the research questions, the research team performed a comprehensive literature review and vocabulary analysis and conducted an empirical study using mixed-methods design. The study consisted of three stages: 1. Literature review and vocabulary analysis 2. Content analysis of position announcements 3. Interviews with professionals working in data curation and research data management-Findings confirm the results from previous research about the lack of common terminology and a variability of the position titles. The concept of data lifecycle highlighted the important role of data curators. However this study also found that many positions in practice were held by non library professionals. The findings indicate that data curation is an evolving sociotechnical practice that involves not only technical systems and services structured around research data life cycle but also a range of social activities around community building. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."""

A. Saisto,2019,D-ark—a shared digital performance art archive with a modular metadata schema,"Digital objects and documentation of intangible cultural heritage pose new challenges for most museums, which have a long history in preserving tangible objects. Art museums, however, have been working with digital objects for some decades, as they have been collecting media art. Yet, performance art as an ephemeral art form has been a challenge for art museums’ collection work. This article presents a method for archiving digital and audiovisual performance documentation. D-ark (digital performance art archive) is based on a joint effort by the artist community T.E.H.D.A.S., which has created the archive, and Pori Art Museum, which is committed to preserving the archive for the future. The aim is to produce sufficient standardized metadata to support this objective. This article addresses the problems of documenting an ephemeral art form and copyright issues pertaining to both the artist and the videographer. The concept of D-ark includes a modular metadata schema that makes a distinction between descriptive, administrative, and technical metadata. The model is designed to be flexible—new modules of objects or technical metadata can be added in the future, if necessary. D-ark metadata schema deploys the FRBRoo, Premis, VideoMD, and AudioMD standards. Administrative and technical metadata modules abide by Finnish digital preservation specifications. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
A. Shahkolaei; A. Beghdadi; M. Cheriet,2019,Blind quality assessment metric and degradation classification for degraded document images,"Epochal documents suffer from several types of noises that accumulate and evolve over time. This significantly affects their quality and makes their storage and the interpretation of their visual content problematic. Digital preservation seems the most viable and the most promising. Moreover, measuring the amount of degradation and quality assessment of degraded documents is highly desirable for applications such as selecting the proper algorithms for enhancement and analysis of document images, filtering the damaged images, tuning the processing algorithms parameters, document repairing, psychological study, etc. The first contribution of this work is the proposition of an efficient Multi-distortion Document Quality Measure (MDQM) for quality assessment of physically degraded document images. The proposed MDQM metric is based on three sets of spatial and frequency image features. These features are extracted from two layers of text and non-text and mapped to the mean opinion scores (MOS) using the regression function. The second contribution of this work is to estimate the probability of four common document image distortion types, namely, paper translucency, stain, readers annotations and worn holes in the degraded images. In our experiment, the correlations of seven no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics with the MOS values are evaluated on two available datasets. It is shown that the performance of MDQM metric is significantly better than the state-of-the-art NR-IQA metrics. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that MDQM metric not only leads to high efficacy for classification of the various degradations but also maintains a remarkable run-time efficiency. It is worth to mention that the proposed method has been conducted for Arabic documents © 2019"

The University recognized that action was required to ensure the long-term preservation of key corporate records and archival material. Staff from the University's Digital Preservation Working Group were therefore tasked with identifying the University's priorities and requirements for preserving its key records, with the aim of producing recommendations for a preservation programme. Knowledge and skills were enhanced by participating in a national digital preservation pilot project and learning from practitioners through workshops and information exchange. The case study shares our reflections on the questions which emerged about metadata, workflows and integrating systems. A key priority will be to engage the support of key decision makers within the University, as it was emphasized repeatedly that successful digital preservation depends as much on resources and organizational strategy as it does on technology. Two of the authors have a particular interest in terminology and we share our work to examine digital preservation's confusing and obscure vocabulary. We conclude that transforming digital preservation into standard practice within organizations can best be achieved through continued collaboration within the digital preservation community. © 2019 Alison Spence, Valerie McCutcheon and Matt Mahon."
A. Tikhonov,2019,Preservation of digital images: Question of fixity,"One of the most important aspects of the long-term digital-image preservation strategy is maintaining data fixity, i.e., assuring the integrity and authenticity of original data. This article aims to highlight the limitations of the approaches used to maintain the fixity of digital images in the digital preservation process and to offer perceptual hashing as a way to alleviate some of the limitations of current approaches, as well as discuss some non-technical implications of the described problems. This paper is exploratory, and while it includes a simple experiment description, it only outlines the problem and testing environment for a possible solution that could be elaborated on in further research. The most commonly used fixity maintaining techniques are immutability of data and file checksums/cryptographic hashes. On the other hand, planning for long-term preservation necessitates the need to migrate data into new future formats to maintain availability and sustainability, and the concept of the file itself should not be assumed to remain forever, which calls for other tools to ascertain the fixity of digital images. The problem goes beyond one that is exclusively technical: bitstream content is not ready for human perception, and the digital preservation strategy should include all the necessary technical steps to assure the availability of stored images to human eyes. This shifts the perspective on what should be considered the digital image in digital preservation. It is not the file, but a perceptible object, or, more specifically—instructions to create one. Therefore, it calls for additional tools to maintain fixity, such as perceptual hashing, transformation logging, and others. © 2019 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

B. W. Bishop; C. Hank,2019,Digital Curation,"The majority of recorded geographic information is produced digitally, whether born digital or made digital through scanning or manual entry. Just as care is taken with nondigital recorded information, such as papers, maps, and photographs, to ensure this information is accessible and useable into the future, so too is care required to ensure digital information remains accessible, useable and reusable. The phrase digital curation, emerged in the early 2000s to describe the applied, lifecycle management of digital resources of scholarly and scientific interest over time for current and future generations of users and in anticipation of technological obsolescence. Digital curation is a broad term encompassing data curation, data management, digital archiving, digital preservation, digital stewardship, and access and use aspects of digital libraries. Digital curation components include all the value-added activities and features that make digital content (either born digital or made digital) understandable, renderable, trusted, secured, and available in perpetuity.

B. W. Styles; M. Colburn,2019,"Taphonomic, environmental, and cultural influences on Archaic Faunal assemblages at Modoc Rock Shelter, Illinois, USA","We incorporated faunal datasets from 1950s to 1980s excavations at Modoc Rock Shelter (11R5), a deeply stratified archaeological site in the central Mississippi River valley of southwestern Illinois, into the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR) as part of a National Science Foundation-funded research project in which nine collaborators in the Eastern Archaic Faunal Working Group (EAFWG) ingested and analyzed faunal datasets from 23 archaeological sites to test hypotheses about changing use of aquatic resources during the Archaic Period (10,000-3000 RCYBP) in the interior Eastern United States. The use of tDAR resulted in the online digital preservation of Modoc Rock Shelter data accumulated by different researchers over five decades from multiple areas of excavation and also provided tools to integrate and synthesize the data. To ensure comparability of Modoc Rock Shelter datasets made by researchers using different coding schemes, we mapped variable attributes to existing and newly created tDAR ontologies. Following the EAFWG taphonomic protocol, we examined evidence for differential bone preservation and destruction caused by weathering, gnawing and chewing, butchering, fragmentation, burning, and bone density-mediated attrition for cultural components of the West Shelter and Main Shelter at Modoc. We also examined potential taphonomic biases caused by differences in recovery techniques, contexts excavated, and settlement function. With due consideration of taphonomic biases, we analyzed variability related to cultural factors and/or environmental change. Using the tDAR integration tool, we compared resource use for the cultural components in the two shelters. Our studies bear out earlier findings that Early Archaic hunter-gatherers at Modoc Rock shelter collected numerous small mammals, especially tree squirrels. Deer hunting and aquatic resource use generally increased during the Middle Archaic; and use of fauna was more specialized in the Late Archaic field camps. We relate these shifts in exploitation to landscape evolution, including stabilization of river systems, development of floodplain lakes, and the opening of the forest in the middle Holocene, as well as to changes in demography and settlement strategies."
C. Bulock; C. McAllister,2019,Preserving Open Access,"Libraries have an established track record of preserving the scholarly record, but this stewardship role has generally been exercised over materials the library has purchased or otherwise acquired. With open access publishing, the library’s role in preservation is less certain, as libraries may facilitate access to a wide array of freely accessible materials without ever obtaining any copies. Additionally, the open access landscape includes many small noncommercial publishers with limited resources that may not be able to invest in long term preservation and access.

C. H. Chang,2019,Does the learning of computational thinking concepts interact with the practice of digital curation in children? A preliminary case study,"Digital storytelling with block-based coding tools for children involved the exercise of both computational thinking (CT) and digital curation (DC). Relevant studies, however, were more concerned with the learning and development of CT concepts rather than the practice of DC. In this regard, the current study aimed to investigate the interrelationship between the learning of CT and DC through digital storytelling, particularly from the standpoint of elementary school children. A total of 35 fifth graders were recruited from a public school in New York City to voluntarily participate in a ten-week digital storytelling workshop where they curated an interactive story within the Scratch environment. Self-made scoring rubrics were implemented to evaluate students' digital storytelling projects from two measures: Computation Measure and Curation Measure. The overall analysis revealed no significant correlations between the two measures. Further investigations, however, on the interrelationship between each of the subcategories of the two measures indicated a number of significant correlations between the learning of CT concepts and the practice of DC.

C. Harding; S. Liggett; M. Lochrie,2019,Digital Engagement in a Contemporary Art Gallery: Transforming Audiences,"This paper examines a curatorial approach to digital art that acknowledges the symbiotic relationship between the digital and other more traditional art practices. It considers some of the issues that arise when digital content is delivered within a public gallery and how specialist knowledge, audience expectations and funding impact on current practices. From the perspective of the Digital Curator at MOSTYN, a contemporary gallery and visual arts centre in Llandudno, North Wales, it outlines the practical challenges and approaches taken to define what audiences want from a public art gallery. Human-centred design processes and activity systems analysis were adopted by MOSTYN with a community of practice-the gallery visitors-to explore the challenges of integrating digital technologies effectively within their curatorial programme and keep up with the pace of change needed today. MOSTYN's aim is to consider digital holistically within their exhibition programme and within the cannon of 21st century contemporary art practice. Digital curation is at the heart of their model of engagement that offers new and existing audience insights into the significance of digital art within contemporary art practice."
C. J. Öhman; D. Watson,2019,Are the dead taking over Facebook? A Big Data approach to the future of death online,"We project the future accumulation of profiles belonging to deceased Facebook users. Our analysis suggests that a minimum of 1.4 billion users will pass away before 2100 if Facebook ceases to attract new users as of 2018. If the network continues expanding at current rates, however, this number will exceed 4.9 billion. In both cases, a majority of the profiles will belong to non-Western users. In discussing our findings, we draw on the emerging scholarship on digital preservation and stress the challenges arising from curating the profiles of the deceased. We argue that an exclusively commercial approach to data preservation poses important ethical and political risks that demand urgent consideration. We call for a scalable, sustainable, and dignified curation model that incorporates the interests of multiple stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2019."
C. L. Liew,2019,Digital audiovisual heritage: An exploration of challenges and a community-based approach to preservation,"While some of the challenges of digitizing audiovisual are common to other types of digitization, there are a few factors that present unique difficulties: the relatively large file size of audiovisual materials that place greater demands on storage and bandwidth, dealing with proprietary formats, obsolescence of analogue materials and playback equipment, complex copyright and digital rights management, relatively under-developed and evolving standards and, lack of freely-available and reliable resources about audiovisual digitization and preservation. This research investigates the experiences and perspectives of staff working with audiovisual materials in the memory sector. The objective is to gain insights into the challenges and issues they face, particularly in terms of preserving and maintaining long-term digital access to audiovisual heritage. The questions guiding this research are: • What challenges do memory institutions staff encounter with audiovisual preservation? How are these challenges dealt with? • Do memory institutions take part in collaborative activities to preserve audiovisual materials? If so, in what capacity? The sampling aimed to include participants from the three main types of memory institutions (i.e. archives, libraries and museums) and to involve participants from different types of entities who were involved in managing audiovisual heritage material, from large national, government-funded institutions to smaller, council- or community-funded ones. The findings show that while there is active digitization in some institutions, in others, their ambitions and efforts are limited by the lack of funding, dedicated staff with the necessary knowledge, skills and experience, and inadequate equipment. The lack of standards and unrealistic or unachievable best practices were mentioned as potential hinder by a number of participants from smaller institutions which could not afford to invest in specialized equipment and recruitment of specialist staff or in providing training for staff. There was the sense of perceived imbalance between large, well-funded and smaller institutions which are less-endowed, with larger institutions setting benchmarks that were unachievable for their smaller, less well-resourced counterparts. Participants from smaller institutions saw the value in a community-based approach to facilitate collaboration on preservation projects as it was unrealistic for them to acquire the skills and to develop the necessary infrastructure on their own. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

While the research and practice of digital curation continues to mature in the cultural heritage sector, relatively little empirical, comparative research on digital curation activities has been conducted to date. The present research aims to advance knowledge about digital curation as it is currently practiced in the field, principally by modeling digital curation workflows from different institutional contexts. This greater understanding can contribute to the advancement of digital curation software, practices, and technical skills. In particular, the project focuses on the role of open-source software systems, as these systems already have strong support in the cultural heritage sector and can readily be further developed through these existing communities. This research has surfaced similarities and differences in digital curation activities, as well as broader sociotechnical factors impacting digital curation work, including the degree of formalization of digital curation activities, the nature of collections being acquired, and the level of institutional support for various software environments. © 2019 IEEE."

When using digitization for creating copies in the form of originals, the archives should consider the trustworthiness of the process – the involved professionals, equipment, software, and procedures. These are the critical points in the process of converting physical originals into digitized originals having legal validity. The authors discuss the authenticity of records converted from physical to digital form. They argue that a digitized record is a copy in the form of an original if it meets the requirements of completeness, reliability of the process, integrity and availability.

E. Ch’ng; S. Cai; T. E. Zhang; F. T. Leow,2019,Crowdsourcing 3D cultural heritage: best practice for mass photogrammetry,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the rationale for democratising the digital reproduction of cultural heritage via “mass photogrammetry”, by providing approaches to digitise objects from cultural heritage collections housed in museums or private spaces using devices and photogrammetry techniques accessible to the public. The paper is intended as a democratised approach rather than as a “scientific approach” for the purpose that mass photogrammetry can be achieved at scale. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology aims to convert the art of photogrammetry into a more mechanical approach by overcoming common difficulties faced within exhibition spaces. This approach is replicable and allows anyone possessing inexpensive equipment with basic knowledge of photogrammetry to achieve acceptable results. Findings: The authors present the experience of acquiring over 300 3D models through photogrammetry from over 25 priority sites and museums in East Asia. The approach covers the entire process from capturing to editing, and importing 3D models into integrated development environments for displays such as interactive 3D, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Practical implications: The simplistic approach for democratised, mass photogrammetry has implications for stirring public interests in the digital preservation of heritage objects in countries where museums and cultural institutions have little access to digital teams, provided that Intellectual Property issues are cared for. The approach to mass photogrammetry also means that personal cultural heritage objects hidden within the homes of various societies and relics in circulation in the antiques market can be made accessible globally at scale. Originality/value: This paper focuses on the complete practical nature of photogrammetry conducted within cultural institutions. The authors provide a means for the public to conduct good photogrammetry so that all cultural heritage objects can be digitally recorded and shared globally so as to promote the cross-cultural appreciation of material cultures from the past. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from the IRs developed in university libraries in Africa, and it was done in two phases. The phases are website investigation to identify the university libraries in Africa that have developed IR and online questionnaire. Findings: Results from the study showed that the majority of IRs in Africa used DSpace software to manage their digital contents, and more than half of the IRs engage in information migration. The study also revealed that the majority of the responding institutions provide long-term digital preservation in their IR. Interestingly, the majority of the IRs has developed digital preservation policy to guide the implementation of digital preservation for IR contents. Finally, the majority of the respondents indicated that they do not have long-term funding and lack the necessary technical staff with required skills to handle and manage the IR. Research limitations/implications: Because of language barriers, data were collected from only universities in English speaking countries in Africa. Practical implications: The findings of this study will make librarians in universities in Africa and other developing countries understand the key issues relating to digital preservation and longevity.

E. Oltmanns; T. Hasler; W. Peters-Kottig; H. G. Kuper,2019,Different preservation levels: The case of scholarly digital editions,"Ensuring the long-term availability of research data forms an integral part of data management services. Where OAIS compliant digital preservation has been established in recent years, in almost all cases the services aim at the preservation of file-based objects. In the Digital Humanities, research data is often represented in highly structured aggregations, such as Scholarly Digital Editions. Naturally, scholars would like their editions to remain functionally complete as long as possible. Besides standard components like webservers, the presentation typically relies on project specific code interacting with client software like webbrowsers. Especially the latter being subject to rapid change over time invariably makes such environments awkward to maintain once funding has ended. Pragmatic approaches have to be found in order to balance the curation effort and the maintainability of access to research data over time. A sketch of four potential service levels aiming at the long-term availability of research data in the humanities is outlined: (1) Continuous Maintenance, (2) Application Conservation, (3) Application Data Preservation, and (4) Bitstream Preservation. The first being too costly and the last hardly satisfactory in general, we suggest that the implementation of services by an infrastructure provider should concentrate on service levels 2 and 3. We explain their strengths and limitations considering the example of two Scholarly Digital Editions. © 2019 The Author(s). ttribution 4.0 Internatio."

Notwithstanding, there are not sufficient public resources to guarantee their preservation and maintenance. Nowadays between several geomatic techniques available, the pillar for the preservation of mankinds heritage is the low cost close photogrammetric acquisition. The advantages of virtual reconstructions based on Multi View Stereo (MVS) and Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms is extended from the heritage documentation to its virtualization or modelling. The digital preservation of archaeological sites is committed in more agile and friendly procedures that give automatic extraction of information to perform in depth analysis over ancient artefacts. In the field of CH research, the characterization and classification of the conservation state of the materials composing the surface of the artefacts are essential to study their damage. The first step for conservation state of a goods is the study of the changes in different times. The possibility to automatically study this time modification due to different factor represents a key point for the archaeologists' work. With this in mind, the aim of this work is to propose a completely automatic methods for change detection between three data set acquired in different epoques. The work flow applied is based on the unsupervised clustering techniques applied on a combination of two type of differences images. The results, unlike the objective, demonstrate that the unsupervised methods are not effectiveness in the CH study, instead of the supervised methods that outperforms in terms of reliability of results."

E. Tsvetkova,2019,MOBILE ACCESS TO DIGITALISED OBJECTS OF CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL HERITAGE,"At present the world is defined by three major characteristics - information society, rapid development of information and communication technologies, globalisation of all spheres of social life. The technological revolution and the emergence of network society create a new economic, social and cultural environment. Thus, traditional cultural institutions face significant challenges, but also new opportunities. On the one hand they have to preserve already established positions and importance, but on the other hand they have to respond to contemporary needs of society.Digitalisation is one of the major ways of safeguarding and popularising cultural and historical heritage. It ensures not only the long-term preservation of cultural values, but also their inclusion in the global information network as it provides unrestricted access to them regardless of time and location. The creation of digital objects offers access to digital cultural and historical portals and collections through modern communication devices - mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, etc.The present paper analyses the advantages and numerous opportunities that mobile access to digitalised objects of cultural and historical heritage provides. The analysis and the conclusions are based on the realisation of the research project Information Portal for Archival-Documentary Heritage of the Bulgarian Revival"" conducted by scientists from the University of Library Studies and Information Technologies (BULGARIA), directed by Assoc. Prof. Hristyian Atanasov. The project's primary aim is the creation of a concept for heritage popularisation and an Internet portal indicating the location of Bulgarian Revival documentary funds in the Republic of Bulgaria. As a result of the project's research and application activity the Information Portal for Archival-Documentary Heritage of the Bulgarian Revival will be realised and enriched over time. In future it may broaden its scope and include even foreign archives' collections.Cultural memory, values and messages transmitted through cultural heritage play a key part in the cultural development of society, in the maintenance of its identity, sense of belonging and unity. Popularisation of cultural and historical heritage through the provision of easy access to it such as the mobile one is a prerequisite for an adequate answer to contemporary users' needs as well as to the requirements of European strategy documents."""

However, African ʿAjamī texts such as those of the Mandinka people of Casamance in southern Senegal are not well known beyond local communities. ʿAjamī texts in Mandinka and other Mande languages are among the least documented. Only a few Mande ʿAjamī texts are available to scholars. Thanks to the British Library's Endangered Archives Programme (EAP), Africa's rich written heritage in ʿAjamī and other scripts previously unavailable to academics is being preserved and made universally accessible. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

G. Fangi,2019,ALEPPO - BEFORE AND AFTER,"In October 2018 I was in Aleppo, Syria, for my second time after the visit in 2010 before the war. It was an unique opportunity to perform 3D surveys of some noticeable buildings and monuments affected by the war. The paper shows some 3D results and comparisons for same monuments. The objects of the survey are some parts of the Citadel walls, the entrance tower of the Citadel, the southern tower, one mosque, the minaret of the Citadel mosque. These results prove undoubtedly that photogrammetry is an essential instrument for the 3D documentation and digital preservation of cultural heritage. The used technique is spherical photogrammetry, based on panoramic images and ad-hoc processing processes. The technique is very much suitable for heritage documentation and if will be transferred to the students of the local faculty of architecture."

Marciano,2019,DRAS-TIC linked data: Evenly distributing the past,"Memory institutions must be able to grow a fully-functional repository incrementally as collections grow, without expensive enterprise storage, massive data migrations, and the performance limits that stem from the vertical storage strategies. The Digital Repository at Scale that Invites Computation (DRAS-TIC) Fedora research project, funded by a two-year National Digital Platform grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS), is producing open-source software, tested cluster configurations, documentation, and best-practice guides that enable institutions to manage linked data repositories with petabyte-scale collections reliably. DRAS-TIC is a research initiative at the University of Maryland (UMD). The first DRAS-TIC repository system, named Indigo, was developed in 2015 and 2016 through a collaboration between U.K.-based storage company, Archive Analytics Ltd., and the UMD iSchool Digital Curation Innovation Center (DCIC), through funding from an NSF DIBBs (Data Infrastructure Building Blocks) grant (NCSA Brown Dog""). DRAS-TIC Indigo leverages industry standard distributed database technology, in the form of Apache Cassandra, to provide open-ended scaling of repository storage without performance degradation. With the DRAS-TIC Fedora initiative, we make use of the Trellis Linked Data Platform (LDP), developed by Aaron Coburn at Amherst College, to add the LDP API over similar Apache Cassandra storage. This paper will explain our partner use cases, explore the system components, and showcase our performance-oriented approach, with the most emphasis given to performance measures available through the analytical dashboard on our testbed website. © 2019 by the authors."""

Pipek,2019,Three Gaps in Opening Science,"The Open Science (OS) agenda has potentially massive cultural, organizational and infrastructural consequences. Ambitions for OS-driven policies have proliferated, within which researchers are expected to publish their scientific data. Significant research has been devoted to studying the issues associated with managing Open Research Data. Digital curation, as it is typically known, seeks to assess data management issues to ensure its long-term value and encourage secondary use. Hitherto, relatively little interest has been shown in examining the immense gap that exists between the OS grand vision and researchers’ actual data practices. Our specific contribution is to examine research data practices before systematic attempts at curation are made. We suggest that interdisciplinary ethnographically-driven contexts offer a perspicuous opportunity to understand the Data Curation and Research Data Management issues that can problematize uptake. These relate to obvious discrepancies between Open Research Data policies and subject-specific research practices and needs. Not least, it opens up questions about how data is constituted in different disciplinary and interdisciplinary contexts. We present a detailed empirical account of interdisciplinary ethnographically-driven research contexts in order to clarify critical aspects of the OS agenda and how to realize its benefits, highlighting three gaps: between policy and practice, in knowledge, and in tool use and development. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V."
G. R. Díaz; M. M. M. Mugica; J. Del Castillo Guevara,2019,Requisites for assessing preservation risks on digital repositories,"Objective. The present article approaches in a succinct way to some theoretical considerations about the preservation and the risk management in digital repositories. In that sense, three key international experiences are presented, in order to assess risks in the digital environment and to offer a set of general requirements that should be taken into account for the assessment of preservation risks in digital repositories. Method. We used the classic documentary analysis of an extensive specialized bibliography on the subject. Likewise, the classic documentary analysis was very useful for the understanding of the three international experiences of risk assessment in digital repositories that are presented. Results. The main result was a set of ten general requirements that should be taken into account for the assessment of preservation risks in digital repositories. Conclusions. The results obtained make it possible to assess the reliability, authenticity and integrity of your resources through the identification of threats in the components of your system, your community of users and your organizational environment. © 2019 University of Pittsburgh.

H. S. Putra; R. Mahendra; F. Darari,2019,BudayaKB: Extraction of cultural heritage entities from heterogeneous formats,"Cultural heritage is the root of national identities, and contributes to tourism, economics, industry, and business. Digital preservation of cultural heritage is therefore crucial, particularly in a form that is easily processable by machines. Available cultural heritage information on Web sources (e.g., Wikipedia) is presented in multiple formats, such as free-form text, lists, and tables. Such formats, however, lack structures and links to other information sources. The provision of cultural heritage information as a knowledge base, that is both structured and linked, would pave new ways for consuming such information. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract entities of cultural heritage from diverse formats (i.e., text, lists, and tables), and to construct a knowledge base of cultural heritage entities, called BudayaKB, using RDF data model that provides an integrated, format-independent view. Our extraction approach follows on the observation that cultural heritage entities are often written down either with common noun descriptors (e.g., Jiwa temple) or hypernym-hyponym sentence patterns (e.g.,... Acehnese traditional weapons such as Rencong...). We evaluate our approach to Indonesian Wikipedia, and achieve a precision of 84% for extracting Indonesian cultural heritage entities. The extracted entities are then imported and linked to the Wikidata KB, allowing greater interoperability of cultural heritage information. BudayaKB is openly available at https://budayakb.cs.ui.ac.id/. © 2019 ACM."

I. Huvila,2019,Use-Oriented Information and Knowledge Management: Information Production and Use Practices as an Element of the Value and Impact of Information,"There is a broad consensus that better models for assessing the impact of information efforts are needed to inform information and knowledge management and digital preservation. In contrast to measuring the quality of information, less attention has been directed to the assessment of knowledge and information processes as its constituent. Using archaeology and archaeological information as a sample context, the aim of this conceptual paper is to probe in to the evaluation of the impact and usefulness of information by taking into account the practices of how it is produced, managed and used. On a basis of a review and discussion of earlier literature on the impact of information and evaluation and management of information in archaeology, it is proposed that a better understanding of how the impact of information unfolds as a part of its production, management and use could contribute to the development of infrastructures, repositories and procedures for the management of the preservation and use of these resources. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Co."
I. M. Faniel; R. D. Frank; E. Yakel,2019,Context from the data reuser’s point of view,"Purpose: Taking the researchers’ perspective, the purpose of this paper is to examine the types of context information needed to preserve data’s meaning in ways that support data reuse. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology and zoology. The study focused on researchers’ most recent data reuse experience, particularly what they needed when deciding whether to reuse data. Findings: Findings show that researchers mentioned 12 types of context information across three broad categories: data production information (data collection, specimen and artifact, data producer, data analysis, missing data, and research objectives); repository information (provenance, reputation and history, curation and digitization); and data reuse information (prior reuse, advice on reuse and terms of use). Originality/value: This paper extends digital curation conversations to include the preservation of context as well as content to facilitate data reuse. When compared to prior research, findings show that there is some generalizability with respect to the types of context needed across different disciplines and data sharing and reuse environments. It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."
I. Subotic; L. Rosenthaler,2019,Preservation of evolving complex information objects,"Having trustworthiness as the driver, the long-term preservation of evolving complex information objects from a RDF-based Virtual Research Environment (VRE) has to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and provenance of the research data it encompasses. Besides the known difficulties, preservation of evolving complex information objects from a VRE provide additional challenges, as not only the objects created inside the VRE but also the VRE as such with its ontologies describing the structure of the digital objects, and additionally any referenced bitstream data, can evolve and change over time. This change over time needs to be captured in such a way, so that not only each object can be recreated to any version from its past, but also its context, namely all surrounding and connected digital objects, and correspondingly also their context and so on. Further, we propose to store all fixity information of the digital objects themselves and also of the provenance to a public blockchain, where it would serve as a single source of truth, which all users could trust. © 2019 Society for Imaging Science and Technology.

Within this context, archivists have questioned the relevance of traditional archival theories and practices. This article examines the implications of the networked society to archival science, with a focus on social media archives. It argues that if we agree that archives are important agents for the construction of society's collective memories then we need to recognize that social media content is part of the human experience and therefore worthy of consideration por its selection and long-term preservation. Finally, the article identifies challenges and opportunities in the management of social media archives by explaining the preservation of President Barack Obama's social media archives and the creation of a collection of tweets about the 2017 students' strike at the University of Puerto Rico. © 2019 Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecologia.

The aim of the present work intends a historical review of Diplomatic and Digital Forensic Sciences, which allows analyzing how the two types of records in question can contribute to verify the authenticity of the born-digital records. The methodology chosen is of a theoretical nature, since we analyze the main exponents of the mentioned areas and their principal methods of study. It is descriptive, because we mention each one of the most relevant contributions in the historical construction of both sciences. The results of this work allow us to argue that both Diplomatic and Digital Forensic Sciences are complementary and analyze and verify the legal, historical and administrative authenticity of born-digital records. In addition they offer methods to preserve these records in the long run. We conclude that it is relevant to study in detail and depth other areas of knowledge with the interest of providing subsidies to strengthening both Diplomatic and Forensic Science for obtaining a better application in born-digital records. © 2019, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

The study adopted a survey research method. The population was made up of 160 librarians in university libraries in South East, Nigeria. The instrument used for data collection was the questionnaire adapted from the UNESCO Digital Preservation Guidelines. Data were analysed, and simple percentages were used to answer the research questions and t-test was used to test the hypotheses. The study revealed that the librarians in the university libraries seem not to have knowledge of the UNESCO Digital Preservation Guidelines but fortunately, out of preservation instincts, the preservation strategies they adopted for their digital materials in the libraries were almost in line with the UNESCO Digital Preservation Guidelines. Moreso, there was no significant difference in the preservation strategies. The study recommends strongly that university librarians in South- East Nigeria should adopt the UNESCO Digital Preservation Guidelines as their working guide in preserving the digital materials in their libraries. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice."

There is need to develop appropriate strategies to manage these electronic records effectively. An electronic records management strategy must be aligned to the agency’s legal mandate as well as reflect best records management practices and technological options. Purpose: This chapter explores the extent to which government agencies in Kenya apply electronic records management strategies in regard to legal framework, long-term preservation, metadata, file naming and file formats, and digital media storage. Method: Additional data was collected through a review of relevant literature. The data was analysed and presented using descriptive statistics. Findings: The findings indicate that the Government of Kenya recognises electronic records as valuable. The study leading to this chapter was conducted as an online survey through which data was collected from records managers working in 90 government agencies who are members of the Network of Library & Information Professionals in Kenya. The link to the online questionnaire, hosted on Google Forms, was circulated through the network’s administrator. 38 officers successfully filled the forms. Conclusion: It has developed and deployed several policies and legislation to enhance the management and use of electronic records for posterity. However, the government lacks facilitative structural and budgetary provisions to implement these effectively. © 2019, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies. All rights reserved."

Case study: Kati fond,"The aim of this research is based on showing the Kati Family Archive, or Kati Fund, in order to demonstrate the importance of its preservation. Because of the content of his manuscripts is a unique family archive that allows investigating the little-known history of cultural minorities in the Iberian Peninsula and several regions of sub-Saharan Africa. However, if measures to protect the family documentary heritage of natural deterioration and actions of human beings are not considered, the manuscripts are in serious danger of disappearing. Consequently, after explaining the state of the matter of the family archives issue and having described the history of Kati members, the most significant properties of the Kati Fond and its current situation are presented. Then reflect on the measures which provide guarantees for the preservation of the Fond and resolve that digitalization and subsequent preservation in digital repositories is the most effective option for the conservation of the Kati Fond. The research concludes with the proposal for the physical organization of the manuscripts that make up the Fond, focusing on the classification, arrangement and description. It is deemed to employ a classification according to the characteristics of the Fond, a mixed arrangement (alphabetical for the most generic documentary units and chronological for the files) and a description based on the standards proposed by the ICA. © 2019 Universidad Complutense de Madrid."

Arcus presents the Library Science team with the opportunity to develop new methods and solutions for addressing a number of important issues. This paper serves to highlight three areas of focus. First, archival appraisal methods will be used for CHOP's large-scale biomedical research data, which presents issues for quality data management and preservation. The Archives will employ expanded appraisal workflows to encompass strong selection and prioritization criteria before a collection is ingested, as opposed to current archival research data frameworks, which situate appraisal after a collection is acquired. Second, CHOP research data efforts will be organized as archival collections because they offer a framework for encapsulating research and mapping the relationships between a dataset, software, protocols and other contextual information critical to data reproducibility. Third, a custom descriptive metadata schema is being developed because archival item-level descriptive metadata doesn't address the complex discovery needs of diverse biomedical data. This will require addressing tension between archival arrangement and the item-level descriptive metadata required for discovery. © 2019 IEEE."

J.-Y. Le Meur; N. Tarocco,2019,The obsolescence of Information and Information Systems CERN Digital Memory project,"In 2016 was started the CERN Digital Memory project with the main goal of preventing loss of historical content produced by the organisation. The first step of the project was targeted to address the risk of deterioration of the most vulnerable materials, mostly the multimedia assets created in analogue formats from 1954 to the late 1990's, like still and moving images kept on magnetic carriers. In parallel was studied today's best practices to guarantee a long life to digital content, either born digital or resulting from a digitization process. If traditional archives and libraries have grown up during centuries establishing recognized standards to deal with the preservation of printed content, the field of digital archiving is in its infancy.This paper shortly exposes the challenges when migrating hundreds of thousands of audio, slides, negatives, videotapes or films from the analogue to the digital era. It will then describe how a Digital Memory platform is being built, conform to the principles of the IS0-16363 digital object management norm that defines trustworthy digital repositories. Finally, as all information repository managers are faced with the necessary migration of underlying systems and the obsolescence of the information itself, the talk will explain how a digital archiving platform focusing only on content preservation could be of direct interest for most of the live systems."

Even if we argue that migrating digital data on newer media at regular intervals will solve this issue. We have an even more important issue of digital data being inaccessible or not readable. This happens if software interpreting the data becomes obsolete. In such case the data is lost, as a bit stream is meaningless unless we can interpret them. Digital data preservation is a long and still open research area. There are various solutions proposed and implemented till date. All the solutions can be broadly classified into two categories (migration and emulation), based on the strategy to ensure longevity. We studied various approaches and strategies done till date for digital data preservation and propose a new framework—a combination of migration and emulation for digital preservation with fewer dependencies on future technology. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019."

Drawing on experiences building partnerships between a university’s anthropology undergraduate program and a provincial museum to teach community-engaged applied digital heritage, the authors present this case study to evaluate models, barriers and benefits of collaboration today. The process of co-creating digital applications in heritage environments were transformative for not only students but also professional archaeologists and communities, highlighting the meaningful engagement and understandings that are developed through collaborative making. However, it also highlighted the challenges facing these types of collaborations, including academic and heritage structures, digital preservation/management, and ethics and inclusivity in digitization projects. © [2019] by the authors; licensee Studies in Digital Heritage, IU, Bloomington (IN), USA.

Collections traditionally focus on content in the form of books, documents, and multimedia. XR is a new form of media that can be difficult to integrate into current collections. In addition, through linked data, we can preserve the context that surrounds the content as well. Finally, XR media can incorporate digital manifestations of items from a library collection within its application. This technology review will explore the possibilities of XR in collection management, focusing on XR as a user interface, the impact on inventory management, and digital preservation. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

K. L. Pendergrass; W. Sampson; T. Walsh; L. Alagna,2019,Toward environmentally sustainable digital preservation,"Digital preservation relies on technological infrastructure (information and communication technology, ICT) that has considerable negative environmental impacts, which in turn threaten the very organizations tasked with preserving digital content. While altering technology use can reduce the impact of digital preservation practices, this alone is not a strategy for sustainable practice. Moving toward environmentally sustainable digital preservation requires critically examining the motivations and assumptions that shape current practice. Building on Goldman's challenge to current practices for digital authenticity and using Ehrenfeld's sustainability framework, we propose explicitly integrating environmental sustainability into digital preservation practice by shifting cultural heritage professionals' paradigm of appraisal, permanence, and availability of digital content. The article is organized in four parts. First, we review the literature for differing uses of the term “sustainability” in the cultural heritage field: financial, staffing, and environmental. Second, we examine the negative environmental effects of ICT throughout the full life cycle of its components to fill a gap in the cultural heritage literature, which primarily focuses on the electricity use of ICT. Next, we offer suggestions for reducing digital preservation's negative environmental impacts through altered technology use as a stopgap measure. Finally, we call for a paradigm shift in digital preservation practice in the areas of appraisal, permanence, and availability. For each area, we propose a model for sustainable practice, providing a framework for sustainable choices moving forward. © Keith L. Pendergrass, Walker Sampson, Tim Walsh, and Laura Alagna."

L. Goddard; D. Seeman,2019,Negotiating sustainability: Building digital humanities projects that last,"Major funding agencies are putting increased pressure on researchers to include sustainability plans in funding applications, although none offer specific guidelines on the number of years for which projects should be sustained. The ideal situation is to negotiate with collaborators to release all project content under a Creative Commons license, and to clearly display this license in the project interface. The digital library platform is typically where preservation workflows begin in academic libraries. Fedora-based digital asset management systems like Islandora and Samvera provide a single place to store objects along with descriptive and administrative metadata that helps to determine the preservation actions that should be taken against each object. Storing multiple copies of a file is insufficient if those copies are not regularly checked for bit rot and other types of degradation, so file integrity tools are another necessary aspect of long-term preservation storage. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Constance Crompton, Richard J.

L. K. Harrison,2019,"A roadmap to applied digital heritage: Introduction to the special issue on digital heritage technologies, applications and impacts","The recent “digital turn” in archaeology has driven methodological advances and opened new research avenues, with wide ranging impacts at multiple scales. The proliferation of methods such as 3D imaging, remote sensing, laser scanning and photogrammetry has led to the datafication of archaeology [Caraher 2016: 467, Mayer-Schönberger et al. 2013: 73]. This process is most evident in research on digital surveying, data visualization, digital archiving, mapping, and image processing, which prioritize the creation and manipulation of large digital datasets. These research avenues often generate more intellectual traffic than “slow archaeology” routes [Caraher 2016], which adopt a reflexive approach to knowledge production, embrace the inherent complexity of digital datasets, emphasize craft modes of archaeological documentation [Perry 2015], and “highlight the value of small and properly contextualized data” [Kansa 2016: 466]. Confronting the growing tension between big data and slow archaeology will be an iterative process. It will evolve as researchers and other stakeholder groups assess the value of digital approaches to preserving, communicating, and interpreting the past as it relates to the present. This special issue of Studies in Digital Heritage is the outcome of a symposium at the 2018 Society for American Archaeology (SAA) conference in Washington, D.C., entitled “Digital Heritage Technologies, Applications, and Impacts.” The articles within contribute to this dialogue by critically assessing the challenges and successes of recent digital heritage projects in museums, teaching and fieldwork contexts. © [2019] by the author; licensee Studies in Digital Heritage, IU, Bloomington (IN), USA.

L. Kramp,2019,The complicated preservation of the television heritage in a digital era,"Television as an electronic audiovisual mass medium has always been difficult to collect and to preserve. The daily routines of broadcasting institutions have hardly promoted attempts of strategic-objectified collecting. Under the influenc of a cultural inferiority of television in general public perception, facilities dedicated to the collection and archiving of this rather new medium have struggled to find ways of coping with its specific challenges. Television as ethereal-volatile as well as material-complex medium seemed to contradict the conventions of institutional archiving that evolved over centuries with a dominant focus on written documents. As an electronic medium, television always depended on technological auxiliaries to endure over time, either by means of film, magnetic tapes, digita versatile or hard discs and playback devices. In the complexity of its material legacy, broadcasting institutions could not always adequately guarantee the collection of televised programming over the past decades. This chapter discusses key issues of television heritage management with a focus on the technical dependencies of longterm preservation of audiovisual broadcasting history. Beyond that, the chapter asks how digitalization promises solutions for the many challenges television preservation faces in the light of material decay and the apparent contradiction between the ostensible omnipresence of media and the ephemerality of broadcasting. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."
L. Li; K. Hasegawa; I. Nii; S. Tanaka,2019,Fused transparent visualization of point cloud data and background photographic image for tangible cultural heritage assets,Digital archiving of three-dimensional cultural heritage assets has increased the demand for visualization of large-scale point clouds of cultural heritage assets acquired by laser scanning. We proposed a fused transparent visualization method that visualizes a point cloud of a cultural heritage asset in an environment using a photographic image as the background. We also proposed lightness adjustment and color enhancement methods to deal with the reduced visibility caused by the fused visualization. We applied the proposed method to a laser-scanned point cloud of a high-valued cultural festival float with complex inner and outer structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enables high-quality transparent visualization of the cultural asset in its surrounding environment. © 2019 by the authors.

Lopez-Caballero,2019,"Hyperbaric cold storage: Pressure as an effective tool for extending the shelf-life of refrigerated mackerel (<i>Scomber scombrus</i>, L.)","The efficacy of hyperbaric cold storage for preserving lean fish has been recently demonstrated but, to the best of our knowledge, no data exist for fatty fish. To evaluate the effect of hyperbaric cold storage on the shelf-life and quality of fatty fish, we stored Atlantic mackerel fillets at 5 degrees C, both at atmospheric pressure and at 50 MPa. After 12 days of hyperbaric storage, no microbial growth was observed. Thus, most counts were similar or slightly lower than those of control samples at day 0, while H2S-producing organisms and sulphite-reducing bacteria reduced under the detection limits. Moreover, no significant lipid degradation was observed. By contrast, increased microbial counts and significant lipid hydrolysis were detected in the samples stored at atmospheric pressure. Moreover, even though the protein profile was significantly altered during hyperbaric storage, most fish-quality indicators (pH, TVB-N, drip loss, water-holding capacity, and firmness after cooking) were better preserved in the mackerel samples stored at 50 MPa. These results clearly prove that hyperbaric cold storage was more efficient than conventional refrigeration for the preservation of Atlantic mackerel fillets.Industrial relevance: Long-term preservation of fatty fish is a challenge for the seafood industry mainly due to lipid degradation that can rapidly reduce fish quality. If effective against lipid degradation, hyperbaric cold storage could be an interesting technology to preserve fish and fish products. The increased cost resulting from hyperbaric storage should be overcome by an extended shelf-life of a high-quality product."

The analyzes were based on technological char-acteristics, which cover issues related to the social media platform, data collection technology, preservation strategy and format of stored data. The contextual characteristics sought to identify metadata related issues in order to guarantee provenance, authentic-ity, rights management and access types. It was possible to conclude that there is an increase in the use of social media in the governmental scope, noting that archival regulatory milestones should be considered in the preservation actions of these contents. Com-municational instantaneity and citizen participation in social media have required the State to act quickly and transparently. The social media platforms do not demonstrate commitment to issues related to the collection and archiving of contents aimed at preserva-tion. The results indicate that there are several simi-larities in the governmental experiences in question. The initiatives started more than 5 (five) years ago and use the main existing social media platforms.

M. Condron,2019,Identifying Individual and Institutional Motivations in Personal Digital Archiving,"Personal digital archiving (PDA) is a relatively new field. As it has developed, two distinct personas have emerged: the individual person, seeking to capture and archive their own or someone else's personal digital materials; and the institution-including museums, libraries, and archives-attempting to acquire and manage personal digital materials. In doing so, institutions also advocate for the preservation and management of personal digital archives and digital file management practices held in private hands. However, individuals and institutions make different choices in terms of curation and management, based on skills, knowledge, purpose, function and economics. Understanding these differences can aid institutional support for personal archives, as well as help to build collaborative frameworks to help personal and institutional differences be better understood.

M. Gil-Melitón; J. L. Lerma,2019,Historical military heritage: 3D digitisation of the Nasri sword attributed to Ali Atar,"Ali Atar, alcaide de Loja y señor de Zagra, nació hacia el año 1393. Fue uno de los principales jefes militares del periodo nazarí y llegó a emparentar con la Casa Real Granadina al casar a su hija Moraima con el mismo Boabdil, último Rey de Granada. Falleció en la batalla de Lucena en 1483, donde se le arrebató una de las magníficas espadas jinetas de manufactura andalusí conservada y localizada en los fondos del Museo del Ejército de Toledo (MUSEJE). Un recurso tan valioso como es el patrimonio cultural ya no se conforma con una conservación física; debe complementarse de una preservación digital exhaustiva en todas sus formas, siendo básico y necesario para su adecuada salvaguarda. Este artículo se centra en la digitalización tridimensional (3D) a partir de la fotogrametría digital y el modelado 3D de esta pieza de armamento histórico militar. Apoyándonos en la fotogrametría y en las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC), vamos a obtener una documentación geométrica de precisión y unos modelos 3D orientados a la investigación, educación, difusión y preservación de un patrimonio tan importante y desconocido como es el patrimonio histórico militar. Esta investigación demuestra la importancia de las técnicas de documentación geométrica para la democratización de los museos. Contribuye a mejorar los procesos de investigación, abriendo una nueva línea de estudio, a partir de la cual, podemos reconstruir el pasado a través de la virtualidad, pudiendo así marcar y confirmar hipótesis históricas. Estas técnicas ofrecen la posibilidad de poner en valor piezas relevantes y singulares dentro y fuera de los museos. © UPV, SEAV, 2015.; Ali Atar, Warden of Loja and Lord of Zagra, was born around 1393. He was one of the principal military leaders of the Nasrid period and came to join the Grenadine Royal House by marrying his daughter Moraima with Boabdil, the last King of Granada. He died in the battle of Lucena in 1483, where one of the magnificent jineta swords of Andalusí manufacture was snatched, which is now conserved and located in the collection of the Toledo Army Museum (MUSEJE). The MUSEJE collections house important scientific, technical, historical and artistic heritage. The historical military heritage needs for its protection, preservation and valorisation the adaptation of new resources and benefit from the usage of new digital technologies. The physical conservation is no longer enough for a resource as valuable as cultural heritage; it needs to be complemented with a comprehensive digital preservation in all its forms, being essential and necessary for its proper safeguard. The virtual era currently emphasizes its presence in the digital documentation, preservation and dissemination of our cultural heritage. In particular, we have oriented and activated it on the historical military heritage, knowledgeable and narrator of our history, of its treasures, and of their relationship within the society as important representations of social and dynastic status. This paper is centred in the 3D digitisation by means of digital photogrammetry and 3D modelling of a historical military weapon. Aided by photogrammetry and information and communication technologies (ICT), we will achieve precise geometric documentation and 3D models that are geared towards research, education, diffusion and the preservation of heritage as important and unknown as is historical military heritage. Photogrammetry gives us the opportunity to bring to light the Ali Atar's sword, one of the most relevant artistic manifestations belonging to the Nasri armament (Fig. 1, Table 1). The multi-view close-range photogrammetry is key to virtualise this jewel and also to contribute to the democratisation of the museum through the web dissemination of its content in a personalized way. Materials such as metals and precious stones, and gold techniques present in the Andalusian weapon required a particular photogrammetric data acquisition using a light booth and polarizing filter (Fig. 10), as sug ested for the latter by (Guidi, Gonizzi, & Micoli, 2014). This setup brought a substantial improvement when dealing with highly reflective materials such as the metallic blade of Ali Atar's jineta sword. The use of the polarising filter attenuated the light that affects and reflects in the piece, benefiting both data acquisition and processing to deliver 3D models. We offered some results ready to safeguard, preserve and disseminate the jineta sword as a high-quality 3D model (Fig. 17), with submillimetre precision from which to obtain all the necessary metric deliverables. From the dense point cloud, two meshes were delivered: i) a homogeneous high resolution mesh keeping all the original features for archiving, conservation and research, and ii) a medium resolution mesh for web-based visualisation and dissemination. The aim was to achieve a detailed geometric documentation as well as complete and accurate 3D models for web repositories (https://skfb.ly/ZzzA), orthoimages (Figures 31 and 32) that allow us to plot from CAD programs all the ornamental and decorative information of the piece (Figures 33 and 34). In addition, we present some results related to monitoring and evaluation of changes in the state of conservation of the piece (Figs. 35, 36 and 37), extending the survey to preventive conservation studies. This research proves the value of geometric documentation techniques for the democratisation of museums. It contributes to improving the research processes, opening a new line of study. From this point we can rebuild the past through the virtuality, being able to mark and confirm historical hypotheses. These techniques offer the chance to give value to relevant and singular pieces in and out of museums. Both heritage and virtual archaeology are fundamental pillars to delve into the future of education and knowledge. © UPV, SEAV, 2015."

Hyperspectral imaging technology can observe murals in the range of visible to near infrared light, providing a scientific and non-destructive way for mural digital preservation. An effective method to extract hidden information from the sootiness of murals in order to enhance the visual value of patterns in ancient murals using hyperspectral imaging is proposed in this paper. Firstly, Minimum Noise Fraction transform was applied to reduce sootiness features in the background of the mural. Secondly, analysis of spectral characteristics and image subtraction were used to achieve feature enhancement of the murals. Finally, density slicing was performed to extract the patterns under the sootiness. The results showed that the extraction of hidden information was achieved with an overall accuracy of 88.97%. © 2019 by the authors."

It is proposed that Information Design (ID) should be considered in its dimensions of science, discipline and methodology as a complement to Digital Curation actions, an emerging area of Information Science (IS). The study discusses how ID converts Social Semantic Web resources into Digital Curation to optimize interaction and creation of new contents, essential for collective memory and contemporary culture. It is a scientific-theoretical discussion, based on the literature of the area and exploratory practices. The discussion involves the following topics: Information Design, the cybernetic understanding of systems and interoperability imbricated in Digital Curation, and, finally, systems interoperability and language convergence. Hence, this research discusses concepts that can act as instruments and methodologies in Information Science. In the contemporary information context, IS and ID are interdisciplinary as a fundamental resource to optimize the quality of information and digital data in a Digital Curation. These interdisciplinary areas dialogue and establish conversational actions through knowledge for constant improvements in information flows. © 2019, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

M. Kearney; D. Giaretta; J. Garrett; S. Hughes,2019,A new technical approach for preservation of your mission data,"The Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model is a standard from CCSDS that has achieved broad adoption, driving digital preservation processes in archives around the world. The OAIS Interoperability Framework (OAIS-IF) is a new initiative from the same CCSDS group that promises to add system interoperability to the OAIS processes. This paper describes the technical direction of OAIS-IF and the innovative usage of model-based engineering in developing the standard. The general problem statement for digital preservation is that as technology and software evolve, historic data sets become inaccessible unless the rigor of the OAIS reference model is used in the preservation process. When the OAIS-IF is as widely accepted as the OAIS Reference Model, then it will enhance the integrity of the digital preservation process as well as improving access to archives and enabling cross-discipline research resulting from the broader access. The more specific problem statement for spaceflight missions is that space agencies pay lip service to preservation of science data, but most do not preserve the “lower priority” engineering data and program/project data that would be valuable to future mission planners. This problem is discussed further in the paper, and an invitation is issued to the IAC audience to join the OAIS-IF development effort to ensure that the Interoperability Framework meets the needs of their missions.

M. Khan; A. U. Rahman,2019,A systematic approach towards web preservation,"The main purpose of the article is to divide the web preservation process into small explicable stages and design a step-by-step web preservation process that leads to creating a well-organized web archive. A number of research articles are studied about web preservation projects and web archives, and designed a step-by-step systematic approach for web preservation. The proposed comprehensive web preservation process describes and combines strengths of different techniques observed during the study for preserving digital web contents into a digital web archive. For each web preservation step, different approaches and possible implementation techniques have been identified that can be adopted in digital archiving. The potential value of the proposed model is to guide the archivist, related personnel, and organizations to effectively preserved their intellectual digital contents for future use. Moreover, the model can help to initiate a web preservation process and create a wellorganized web archive to efficiently manage the archived web contents. A section briefly describes the implementation of the proposed approach in a digital news stories preservation framework for archiving news published online from different sources. © 2019 American Library Association.

M. M. Tapfuma; R. G. Hoskins,2019,Usage of institutional repositories in Zimbabwe's public universities,"Background: The concept of institutional repositories (IRs) has gained traction across the globe; Zimbabwe's public universities have established IRs to capture, store, archive and widely disseminate their institutional intellectual capital. However, research output from the repositories remains obscure, hence the motivation to explore the use of IRs in the universities to ascertain if they are getting a return on their investment in IR technologies.Objectives: The objectives of this study were to establish the range of items contained in the repositories; establish the growth of the repositories and determine the software platforms being used.Method: A mixed methods approach was used, with methodological triangulation. Study participants included eight public universities, library directors, assistant or IR librarians; complete enumeration was done. Data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and bibliometric analysis of IRs, policy documents, Directory of Open Access Repositories and Registry of Open Access Repositories. Qualitative data were analysed thematically; Statistical Package for the Social Sciences was adopted to analyse quantitative data and generate tables.Results: The IRs largely contain peer-reviewed content, while the DSpace software is popularly used. Most of the repositories are searchable on the Internet. The biggest repository has acquired 2520 items in 10 years, while the smallest one has 46 items in 7 years. The population of the IRs is slow because of various challenges.Conclusion: The repositories have not been successful because populating them is a challenge. This could partly be because of libraries being too selective about content going into the IRs. Adopting the DSpace software by the universities points to long-term preservation plans for their intellectual output stored in the repositories for posterity."

M. Zarnitz; T. Bähr; U. Arning,2019,Ten years of strategic collaboration of libraries in digital preservation,"The German National Specialist Libraries cooperate closely in the field of digital preservation. One of the partners hosts the preservation system, while each library creates its own workflows and is free to ingest its digital material into this system. This paper delineates the factors for success of this collaboration. It describes the different aspects of collaboration in digital preservation and describes the benefits and costs of cooperation in this field as a case study. Digital preservation is resource intensive and the required technology is complex. Therefore the libraries benefit from synergy effects: Reduced cost by sharing the preservation system, usage of similar workflows and formats of digital objects, work sharing in networking activities and staff training. The paper also stresses the advantages and difficulties while applying for certificates in a consortium. Their collaboration extends to intensive national and international networking activities, which yield more contacts than a single library could maintain if it acted on its own. The libraries’ staffs are active in working groups of nestor—the German network for digital preservation—and in working groups of the Open Preservation Foundation. © 2019, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

Rethinking digital and digitization as social and cultural expressions of the contemporary era becomes unavoidable. This implies the need to rethink digital data as cultural entities produced by societies, and no longer as mere tools for simplifying administrative management or as virtual surrogates of analog cultural heritage. It is urgent to undertake serious policies aimed at ensuring the data preservation not only in theri formal aspects, but above all in their structural and descriptive contents which qualify and identify their creative and evolutionary processes: We have to assess data in their new role as witnesses of our processes evolution and as memory to be transferred to the future. The present contribution aims at proposing a structural redefinition of digital data, with the goal to renew their function and role as cultural resources by which the future generation will know the processes of contemporary digital age, entrusting metadata with the function of primary sources of information and knowledge to read, study, share and reuse. © 2019, University of Bologna Department of Classical and Italian Philology, Alma Mater Studiorum.

N. Jofré; G. Rodríguez; Y. Alvarado; J. Fernandez; R. Guerrero,2019,Evaluating an End-to-End Process for Herpetological Heritage Digital Preservation,"Documentation of institutional biological collections are essential for scientific studies and conservation of the biodiversity of a region. In particular, preserved specimens require the development of a short- and long-term plan to prevent damage. In this context, the 3D digitisation of this type of documentation provides innovative mechanisms to safeguard the valuable information provided by the collections and at the same time prevent any possible loss of information. At the moment, the potential of laser scanning in model reconstruction is well-known, but developed works using this method for 3D construction reveal a lack of reliable, precise and flexible solutions. Furthermore, visualisation of results is often very useless and does not go beyond web-based applications. This work presents an analysis of 3D modelling using two digitisation techniques: laser scanning and photogrammetry; combined with real time VR and AR visualizations and 3D printing. Subsequently, in accordance with the processes carried out, qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the results obtained are accomplished. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The World Digital Library archives and provides access to unique cultural materials from libraries, archives, museums, educational institutions, and international organizations from 193 countries around the world. It aims at promoting international and intercultural understanding, expand the volume and variety of cultural content on the Internet, provide resources for educators, scholars, and general audiences, and to narrow the information divide within and among countries by capacity building in partner institutions. Objectives: The World Digital Library provides unprecedented, free of charge access to significant primary historic materials including; manuscripts, maps, rare books, films, sound recordings, prints and photographs. The aim of the present study is to analyze such resources on the basis of the regional attributes, lingual patterns, time periods, subject coverage and institutional contribution. Methodology: The World Digital Library website is being explored to retrieve the information to examine its collection on various facets. Results: The maximum number of resources in the World Digital Library is available on Europe (7276), dealing with History and Geography (16,135), contributed by the Library of Congress (8537) and available in the Arabic language (2830). Implications: The study can act as an indicator highlighting the importance of the WDL as a promising platform for preservation, access and descent of global cultural and heritage resources. © 2019 Library Philosophy and Practice."
P. Falcão; T. Ensom,2019,Conserving Digital Art,"The emergence of digital technologies has impacted not only the nature of museums as institutions, but also the practice of artists. Consequently, artworks which employ digital media (such as video and software) in their access or display are making their way into permanent collections in increasing numbers. These digital media can pose considerable challenges in terms of long-term access and display, due to a changing technological environment and resulting risk of obsolescence. Contemporary art museums are among those leading the way in developing approaches to collecting and caring for these types of object. This accompanies a general shift in conservation theory and practice, from a traditional object-centric approach to one which allows the continued evolution of the work through time. The presence of digital media in collections is also forcing the art museum to look beyond its walls and engage with experts from formerly unfamiliar domains. In this chapter, we will introduce the imperatives driving digital preservation and discuss the state of the art in the field of conserving and preserving digital art. We will then focus on recent research relating to specific digital media types and present a number of case studies from the Tate collection. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This project, funded by the British Council, combined education, history, and heritage for the digital preservation of tangible and intangible aspects of heritage associated with the 19th century Said Palace (Ksar Said) in Tunis. We produced an interactive 3D model of Ksar Said and developed learning resources to build Tunisian students' critical engagement with their heritage through inquiry learning activities within the 3D model. We used a user-centred approach, based on pre-assessment (i.e., co-creation of contents), mid-term evaluation (i.e., feedback on contents and preliminary design of virtual activities), and post-assessment design (i.e., user trial). Our results demonstrate the potential of this novel approach to virtual learning and inform future co-design, evaluation and implementation choices for improving the generative power of three dimensional virtual replication of heritage sites in the cultural heritage sector. © 2019 by the authors."

The corpus also serves as a means for the long-term preservation of Abkhaz language documents in digital form, and as a pedagogical tool for language learning. It now comprises more than 10 million words and is continuously being extended. Abkhaz is a lesser-resourced language; prior to this work virtually no computational resources for the language were available. As a member of the West-Caucasian language family, which is characterized by an extremely rich, polysynthetic morphological structure, Abkhaz poses serious challenges to morphosyntactic analysis, the main problem being the high degree of morphological ambiguity. We show how these challenges can be met, and what we plan to further enhance the performance of the analyser. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

For a sufficiently long period of existence of the archive there have been significant changes in data formats, data processing methods and storage of information. To date, the archive capacity is 1.5 TB. By modern standards, it is a small archive, but most of the observatories in the world produce archives of a similar volume and content. The most pressing data management tasks in any archive include validation of data, ingestion, access, long-term preservation with support for timely migrations to new data media. Standardization of these stages, the creation of software on the base of the standards for the entire community, can be a good help for such archive providers, whose capabilities in terms of software development are often limited because of the small size of a team and the necessary level of training."
P. Westerlund; I. Andersson; T. Päivärinta; J. Nilsson,2019,Towards automated pre-ingest workflow for bridging information systems and digital preservation services,"Purpose: This paper aims to automate pre-ingest workflow for preserving digital content, such as records, through middleware that integrates potentially many information systems with potentially several alternative digital preservation services. Design/methodology/approach: This design research approach resulted in a design for model- and component-based software for such workflow. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented and demonstrated in context of a European research project, ForgetIT. Findings: The study identifies design issues of automated pre-ingest for digital preservation while using middleware as a design choice for this purpose. The resulting model and solution suggest functionalities and interaction patterns based on open interface protocols between the source systems of digital content, middleware and digital preservation services. The resulting workflow automates the tasks of fetching digital objects from the source system with metadata extraction, preservation preparation and transfer to a selected preservation service. The proof-of-concept verified that the suggested model for pre-ingest workflow and the suggested component architecture was technologically implementable. Future research and development needs to include new solutions to support context-aware preservation management with increased support for configuring submission agreements as a basis for dynamic automation of pre-ingest and more automated error handling. Originality/value: The paper addresses design issues for middleware as a design choice to support automated pre-ingest in digital preservation. The suggested middleware architecture supports many-to-many relationships between the source information systems and digital preservation services through open interface protocols, thus enabling dynamic digital preservation solutions for records management. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We analysed the current landscape of data repositories to create a detailed description of available repositories and assess their suitability for hosting data from clinical studies, from the perspective of the clinical researcher.MethodsWe assessed repositories that enable storage, sharing, discoverability, re-use of the IPD and associated documents from clinical studies using a pre-defined set of 34 items and publicly available information from April to June 2018. For this purpose, we developed an indicator set to capture the maturity of the repositories' procedures and their suitability for the hosting of IPD. The indicators cover guidelines for data upload and data de-identification, data quality controls, contracts for upload and storage, flexibility of access, application of identifiers, availability of metadata, and long-term preservation.ResultsWe analysed 25 repositories, from an initial set of 55 identified as possibly relevant. Half of the included repositories were generic, i.e. not limited to a specific disease or clinical area and 13 were launched in the last 8 years. The sample was extremely heterogeneous and included repositories developed by research funders, infrastructures, universities, and editors. All but three repositories do not apply a fee for uploading, storage or access to data. None of the repositories completely demonstrated all the items included in the indicator set, but three repositories (Dryad, Drum, EASY) met - fully or partially - all items. Flexibility of data-access modalities appears to be limited, being lacking in half of the repositories.ConclusionsOur evaluation, though often hampered by the lack of sufficient information, can help researchers to find a suitable repository for their datasets. Some repositories are more mature because of their support for clinical dataset preparation, contractual agreements, metadata and identifiers, different modalities of access, and long-term preservation of data. Further work is now required to achieve a more robust and accurate system for evaluation, which in turn may encourage the sharing of clinical study data.Trial registrationStudy protocol available at https://zenodo.org/record/1438261#.W64kW9Egrcs."
R. Däßler; U. Preuß,2019,Digital Preservation of Cultural Heritage for Small Institutions,"In this article we describe a concept for the digital preservation of the cultural heritage of smaller cultural institutions without their own infrastructure, in order to preserve and use digital objects in the long term. For this purpose, a digital archive will be extended by a pre-ingest component, which will aggregate the digital objects of the cultural institutions and provide access to the archived information. The proposed system for distributed digital preservation can be described by an extended Open Archive Information System (OAIS) reference model-the Outer-Inner OAIS (OO-IO) model. In the Federal state of Brandenburg there are about 340 archives, museums and libraries. Most of them are rather small but of great significance for cultural heritage. The digital preservation of data and information is therefore one of the biggest challenges. Unfortunately, smaller institutions often lack the knowledge and the resources to meet this challenge. The described approach supports these cultural and research institutions in their efforts to preserve cultural heritage. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."
R. Han,2019,Building Companionship between Community and Personal Archiving: Strengthening Personal Digital Archiving Support in Community-Based Mobile Digitization Projects,"The interconnectedness between personal digital archiving (PDA) and community-based digital archiving provides an entry point for thinking about how to better bridge the two within single projects. Flexibility and sustainability are dimensions that warrant special consideration to support PDA within community-based digital archiving projects. This paper examines the flexibility and sustainability of two community-based mobile digitization projects (Culture in Transit and Georgia HomePLACE DigiKits) in supporting PDA. The assessment shows that the projects are in a good position to support PDA, with only some concerns about ensuring sustainable access to digitization equipment and sufficient guidance in long-term preservation. Drawing from this work, I propose three ways community-based mobile digitization projects can be redesigned to further strengthen their support for PDA without undermining their community-based objectives. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the value in considering connections and differences between community and personal archiving needs in current and future projects, and calls for further coordination of efforts and collaboration to build better collaboration between community and personal archiving. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019."
R. Ka'ai-Mahuta,2019,Preserving indigenous voices: Web archiving in Aotearoa/New Zealand,"Digital technology is an important modern tool for Indigenous languages, cultures, and voices. The web has been embraced by many Indigenous communities as it provides an effective way to disseminate information and connect community members. This is especially relevant as the displacement and migration of Indigenous Peoples has meant that language and cultural communities are becoming less localised and more dispersed. It is faster, easier, and more cost effective to share knowledge digitally. That is also what makes digital content vulnerable to being changed, deleted, or 'lost'-one of the strongest arguments for web archiving. We must ensure that the knowledge and information that is shared digitally by Indigenous communities is collected, preserved, and made accessible to future generations. However, the collection and storage of Indigenous knowledge and data raises questions regarding control, self-determination, and the right to free, prior and informed consent. © 2019, Scuola Iad ."

R. Yaagoubi; A. Al-Gilani; A. Baik; E. Alhomodi; Y. Miky,2019,SEH-SDB: a semantically enriched historical spatial database for documentation and preservation of monumental heritage based on CityGML,"Cultural heritage has a great and inestimable value for communities. Unfortunately, several historical monuments are under deteriorating conditions mainly due to the lack of knowledge about their historical importance. Hence, it is necessary to provide efficient solutions to preserve these monuments. An effective approach for the preservation of cultural heritage should address two main aspects: documentation and information. The first aspect is related to methods that are used to document and digitally archive historic buildings by using appropriate materials and techniques for acquiring 3D spatial data. The second aspect aims to inform the population and policy makers about the importance of the historical heritage in a simple, effective, and interactive manner. In this paper, we propose an original approach to design a semantically enriched historical spatial database (SEH-SDB) for documentation and information of monumental heritage. First of all, a LiDAR acquisition of the historical heritage should be undertaken to capture its current condition. Then, the SEH-SDB database will be designed according to four semantic packages related to historical buildings that are (1) Components package, (2) Material package, (3) Historical package, and (4) Social package. The component package is based on the CityGML standard, which ensures a high interoperability for 3D models. The material package represents the material used in the construction of the building (wood, stone …). The historical package informs about historical elements that characterize the building and its temporal evolution. The social package aims to inform about the main social activities that may take place in the historical building. Based on the SEH-SDB, a 3D historical GIS is developed to provide rich semantic information about historical sites. At the end of this paper, a case study of a historical monument named “Ribat Banajah” in Jeddah Historical City in Saudi Arabia is presented. A digital archiving of the current state of this building is performed by using terrestrial LiDAR in combination with other classical surveying techniques (traversing, leveling, and GPS). Then, a building information model of this building is created and exported to the 3D HGIS designed for the documentation of historical buildings. © 2018, Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET)."

Methods: Data including 54 fields of each journal listed in DOAJ were provided by the DOAJ team in June 5, 2018. We focused on 11 fields including digital standards, content licensing types and digital archiving policy. Results: Based on raw data from DOAJ from June 5, 2018, there are 11,534 journals registered in the directory. Among all journals in the directory, Asian journals comprise 1,972 journals from 18 countries. Indonesian journals rank at the top for Asian journals, with 1,322 journals originating from that country. Other major Asian countries' registration status includes India (238), South Korea (82), China (80), Malaysia (45), Pakistan (39), Taiwan (30), Thailand (27), Japan (20), and Hong Kong (20). Eighty percent of journals (1,584) are using PDF-only as their full-text format, and DOI is adopted in 852 journals (43%). Almost 98% of journals (1,936) are having a Creative Commons license; however, 85% of journals (1,689) do not have a digital archiving policy. Conclusion: Generally, digital standards are well implemented in South Korea, and digital archiving/deposit policy is well accepted in Indian journals.

S. Langley,2019,"Planning for the End from the Start: An Argument for Digital Stewardship, Long-Term Thinking and Alternative Capture Approaches for Digital Content","Sustainability and continued access to digital cultural heritage, digital humanities content and research materials can be challenging. For any research project, available resources and dependencies set the limits for what is possible. In the digital environment, consideration of these limitations can tend to focus on the technological aspect. However, it is not just technology that ensures the success of a project or long-term access to digital content. Using the Three-Legged Stool Model for Digital Preservation (Kenney and McGovern in Digital Preservation Management: Implementing Short-term Strategies for Long-term Problems, 2003 [38]) (and other relevant models) provides an important foundation to ensure that any digital cultural heritage or digital humanities project is approached holistically. In addition, digital stewardship (Lazorschak in The Signal, 2011 [44]) should also be considered as an essential building block for digital cultural heritage and the digital humanities. Historically, questions of sustainability and ongoing access are often brought to the fore only as funding streams near their end, or as research project champions retire. Sustainability of digital content has been a topic of debate for many years (Bodleian Libraries in Digital Humanities Archives for Research Materials, Oxford, [2], Cantara in Longterm Preservation of digital humanities in OCLC Systems and Services 22:38-42, 2006 [10]). In recent years, the importance of sustainability is being further recognised, with research funding bodies requiring plans for long-term preservation and access as a part of applications for project funding, such as requiring the inclusion of this information in DataManagement Plans (DMP) (UK Research and Innovation-Arts and Humanities Research Council in Research Funding Guide, 2019 [61]). The author advocates for creating specific technical information necessary for long-term preservation, as well as borrowing and adapting from other disciplines. While long-term preservation and access may have been considered from the outset, the author also argues that not enough is done to establish a digital stewardship framework approach. The Digital Preservation at Oxford and Cambridge (DPOC) project (2006-2018) (Digital Preservation at Oxford and Cambridge, 2016 [21]), provides the opportunity to look more holistically at how digitised and born-digital content is created, acquired, preserved and made available. At Cambridge University Library (CUL), a case study approach has been adopted, in order to better understand the needs of different ‘classes’ of digital content. Examples discussed include digitised fragments from the Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah Collection and the interactive data in theKymata Atlas, illustrating two very different challenges of stewarding digital content. Through the case study research, the author and colleagues have identified that digital cultural heritage and digital humanities projects often develop a website or online resource as a mechanism for providing access to digital content project outputs. If not adequate planned for, digital content is at risk of becoming inaccessible after a project ends. Migration of files and various web archiving approaches are examined as possible preservation techniques, as well as other digital capture and documentation approaches more commonly used in contemporary art, time-based media and multi-platform archiving domains (Langley et al. in Proceedings of the 19th International Symposium on Electronic Art, ISEA 2013, 2013 [43]). Considering how to preserve and provide access to digital content right from the beginning of a project is essential. Taking a holistic digital stewardship approach-while learning from the lessons of past projects and borrowing from similar disciplines-can assist in better preparing for the end of a digital cultural heritage or digital humanities project. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

The GAMS is a Fedora Commons-based repository which hosts more than one hundred research projects from different scholarly domains that extensively employ semantic web technologies and ontologies in their implementation. Many projects expose their research data as RDF and use shared vocabularies for shared entities. Using representative examples from digital scholarly editions, digital collections, and language resources, we show how ontologies enrich the user experience at the levels of modelling, analysis, and integration. The use of shared ontologies by projects with similar data allows search and retrieval scenarios to function across equivalent datasets in different projects and the formalization of data through large datasets allows the comparison of larger bodies of information than were possible using traditional (analogue) humanities methods.

T. G. Stavropoulos; S. Andreadis; E. Kontopoulos; I. Kompatsiaris,2019,SemaDrift: A hybrid method and visual tools to measure semantic drift in ontologies,"Semantic drift is an active field of research, aiming to identify and measure changes in ontologies across versions in time, closely related to several fields such as ontology evolution and versioning. However, practical and widely adopted methods for measuring semantic drift are mostly either not directly applied to Semantic Web formalisms or largely dependent on specific models and domains. This paper presents a novel hybrid method, which combines existing identity-based and morphing-based approaches, and, in turn, introduces further insights such as hybrid chains of concepts across ontology versions and concept stability ranking. Furthermore, it introduces the SemaDrift Application Suite, which integrates both new and existing methods, including structural and text similarity measures, provided as open-source. The applications offer a graphical user interface to calculate and visually explore semantic drift metrics, in order to support and promote their use to Semantic Web and domain experts alike. Specifically, the SemaDrift plugin for the popular Protègè platform is intended for ontology engineers, while SemaDriftFx allows a wider audience of users to visually investigate drift either as numeric output or visually through graphs. Two use case scenarios demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the methods and tools in the domain of digital preservation and Web Services, with insights previously hard to obtain. Standard scale and concrete end-user evaluation tasks were used to acquire positive preliminary feedback on the usability of the SemaDriftFx tool. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

This is the NBS where MET Norway has the technical responsibility in terms of providing the infrastructure and storage capacity for data management. Serving the data through two separate platforms, the end users have access to the data in its original format in addition to Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 products in NetCDF-4/CF. Using the latter format, services like regridding, subsetting, visualization and aggregation are integrated utilizing OPeNDAP in combination with OGC WMS and OGC WPS. In addition, data uploading and retrieving operations are simplified for an end user since streaming of data by means of OPeNDAP is supported in multiple programming languages. Due to the strong coupling between space based earth observations, in-situ observation, model data etc, disseminating data in a generic data management system utilizing NetCDF-4/CF and OPeNDAP is convenient for seamless integration across branches. However, the current CF version is not mature for handling all parts of the Sentinel data but future development looks very promising. © 2019 The Author(s)."

Considering the number of historical and cultural properties and their deterioration status, the fastest and most accurate method of documentation is required to be used in these studies. With the development of technology, traditional documentation methods have been replaced by digitization which enables the acceleration of the whole process. 3D laser scanning technology is the most rapid, accurate (metric) and reliable method used in digitization studies of cultural properties / cultural heritage nowadays. By using laser point cloud data, 3D model of cultural properties can also be generated quickly and in detail as well as documentation and digital archiving. At this point, the integration of digital camera or 360 panoramic camera, which is very popular today, and point cloud data makes a significant contribution to further analyzes. This study expresses the 3D digitalization processes of the Suleymaniye Kulliye (Mosque and Complex), which is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. 3D model and VR applications, which are also outputs of the study, are discussed at the end part."
T. Kolydas,2019,Timestamping Metadata Using Blockchain: A Practical Approach,"Long-term preservation of digital information requires confidence in the credibility and ability of digital archives and systems to consistently provide accessible and usable content. Ensuring that the provided information has remained unchanged over time is a particular challenge. Trusted timestamping is an effective method that allows anyone to prove without any doubt that specific content existed at a particular date and time. A practical approach for trusted timestamping using the Ethereum blockchain is presented here. A complete metadata record is stored as transaction input data along with a document hash digest. The approach is uncomplicated, human and machine readable, self-explanatory, and modular. It supports metadata preservation and copyright protection of digital documents applying verification without disclosure. The approach aims at extending current digital archives and systems using existing, well-tested technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The study focused on digital preservation practices within academic libraries in South Africa. A number of studies were undertaken in the field of preservation in South Africa and they focused on the preservation of cultural heritage, preservation of electronic government and preservation of public digital information. The major gap in the literature reinforces the need to closely examine digital preservation practices in academic libraries in South Africa. There is a need to understand the extent of preservation of digital resources in various contexts in order to guarantee access to them for future generations. This will improve our understanding of the preservation of digital resources in academic libraries in the wake of the digital revolution.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate digital preservation practices in academic libraries in South Africa in order to suggest solutions for effective digital preservation.Method: The survey research method was used for data collection. Twenty-seven academic institutions in South Africa were surveyed. Data were analysed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.Results: The findings revealed that academic libraries experienced difficulties in preserving and sustaining their digital resources because of the absence of established standards, policies and procedures, inadequate resources, as well as a lack of skills and training. They also had difficulties with limited funding and collaboration efforts, and the threat of technological obsolescence because of the constantly changing software and hardware, poor technology infrastructure and legal issues.Conclusion: All these challenges have created the need for best practices and solutions to facilitate the long-term preservation of digital resources in the academic libraries. Recommendations were made on the basis of the results."
T. Noma; K. Yamamoto; Ieee,2019,Chain of Equipments: A Scheme for Life-Time Personal Photo Storage,"Photographs in digital form is much more difficult to preserve than in films and prints. While long-term digital preservation has long been studied, the methods are for organizations, and are far from realistic for personal use. This paper proposes a new scheme for life-time personal photo preservation. In the scheme called a chain of equipments, a long-term photo preservation policy is determined first, and then manufacturers supply tailored storage devices, called ring equipments, under the policy. Complicated tasks for migration is encapsulated in the ring equipments, and a chain of ring equipments preserves photo data for a long time. The specifications of ring equipments are constrained only by the policy, and then the manufacturers can avoid technology obsolescence."

Zhao,2019,Ocean FAIR data services,"Well-founded data management systems are of vital importance for ocean observing systems as they ensure that essential data are not only collected but also retained and made accessible for analysis and application by current and future users. Effective data management requires collaboration across activities including observations, metadata and data assembly, quality assurance and control (QA/QC), and data publication that enables local and interoperable discovery and access, and secure archiving that guarantees long-term preservation. To achieve this, data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Here, we outline how these principles apply to ocean data, and illustrate them with a few examples. In recent decades, ocean data managers, in close collaboration with international organizations, have played an active role in the improvement of environmental data standardization, accessibility and interoperability through different projects, enhancing access to observation data at all stages of the data life cycle and fostering the development of integrated services targeted to research, regulatory and operational users. As ocean observing systems evolve and an increasing number of autonomous platforms and sensors are deployed, the volume and variety of data increases dramatically. For instance, there are more than 70 data catalogues that contain metadata records for the polar oceans, a situation that makes comprehensive data discovery beyond the capacity of most researchers. To better serve research, operational, and commercial users, more efficient turnaround of quality data in known formats and made available through web services is necessary. In particular, automation of data workflows will be critical to reduce friction throughout the data value chain. Adhering to the FAIR principles with free, timely and unrestricted access to ocean observation data is beneficial for the originators, has obvious benefits for users and is an essential foundation for the development of new services made possible with big data technologies. © 2019 Tanhua, Pouliquen, Hausman, O'Brien, Bricher, de Bruin, Buck, Burger, Carval, Casey, Diggs, Giorgetti, Glaves, Harscoat, Kinkade, Muelbert, Novellino, Pfeil, Pulsifer, Van de Putte, Robinson, Shaap, Smirnov, Smith, Snowden, Spears, Stall, Tacoma, Thijsse, Tronstad, Vandenberghe, Wengren, Wyborn and Zhao."

U. Dutta,2019,Digital Preservation of Indigenous Culture and Narratives from the Global South: In Search of an Approach,"This research seeks to digitally preserve cultural histories and artifacts, which are practiced/produced in the underserved indigenous spaces of rural eastern India. This paper is a case study of co-developing Sangraksha—a digital humanities application. The application seeks to facilitate the process of writing history from the below by underrepresented populations at the margins. The villages in this research were geographically remote and socio-economically underdeveloped. The research populations represented individuals who possessed low levels of literacy, limited language proficiency in English and mainstream Indic languages (e.g., Hindi and Bengali), as well as limited familiarity with computers and computing environments. Grounded in long-term ethnographic engagements in the remote Global South, this study explored a range of cultural, aesthetic, and contextual factors that were instrumental in shaping and co-generating digital humanities solutions for under-researched international populations. On one hand, the research initiative sought to co-create a culturally meaningful and welcoming digital environment to make the experience contextually appropriate and user-friendly. On the other hand, grounded in visual and sensory methodologies, this research used community generated imageries and multimedia (audio, photographs and audio-visual) to make the application inclusive and accessible. Moreover, the application-development attempt also paid close attention to intercultural, local-centric, community-driven co-design aspects to make the approach socially-embedded and sustainable in the long term. © 2019 by the author."
U. U. Shah; S. Gul,2019,"Lockss, Clockss & Portico: A look into digital preservation policies","Digital preservation is the process of preserving information in the digital form. By digital form we mean a non- print form. Information is moving from print to web (non-print) and it has become easy for masses especially the scholarly population to access information on the web from anywhere 24*7. Since digital information is more prone to damage and loss than print information, therefore, it is imperative to protect access to this information not only for the benefit of present but for future generation as well. Various initiatives and policies are currently in place to ensure the long term preservation of digital information. LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, and PORTICO are the three major digital preservation initiatives aimed at protecting and preserving the digital content for its long term access and use.

V. Iacob,2019,Looking for Bauh: Negatives and Prints from the Romanian Peasant Museum Image Archive,"The article discusses a number of Aurel Bauh prints and negatives from the collections of the Ethnological Archive of the Romanian Peasant Museum. The present study uncovers visual documentation relevant to the history of sociological research in Romania, while also proposing a new periodisation for some of the prints and negatives found in the Ethnological Archive collections. This research is at the core of a visual literacy and digital curation project developed by the Romanian Peasant Museum in 2018 entitled Reţelele Privirii. The project was imagined as a starting point for a program of digitization and publication that will make available to the wider public the entirety of the Ethnological Archive collections in the following years. In this context, the pilot project developed around Bauh’s work is representative not only for the type of artefacts amassed by the museum, but also for the manner in which this cultural heritage was handled throughout this institution’s history. Bauh’s work bridges several research fields that are relevant for recent cultural history in Romania. It also points to a number of instances and contexts that can shed light on the local history of photography. Furthermore, Aurel Bauh’s life and work make him an excellent case study for an artist tackling the ideological fluctuations that characterized the European cultural landscape in the first half of the twentieth century. © 2019, National Museum of the Romanian Peasant.

W. M. T. D. Ranasinghe; JunMinChung,2019,Understanding the Curation Service in Libraries: Is it a Revolution or an Evolution of Reference Service?,"Popularly known to be originated in museums and art galleries, curation is widely applied in many other fields ranging from curation commerce to curated databases by today. Libraries also have started to provide different types of curation services such as data curation, digital curation, content curation, book curation, and social curation. However, the relationship between the curation service and the library service is not adequately studied and documented. The objective of this paper is to address that gap by analyzing the relationship between curation service and the library service. Particularly, this paper pays attention to study the relationship between curation service and library reference service. The research methods used by this study were an extensive literature review followed by some carefully selected real-world examples of curation services in libraries and other fields. The authors have analyzed and documented the origin and the meaning of two concepts, the challenges faced by library reference service, and the applicability of curation as a modest form of library reference service in the 21st-century. Based on the study findings, this paper concludes that curation service is not a new concept for the library but a natural evolution of the library reference service in response to the changing information environment and user expectations in the digital age."

Sarim,2019,Digital preservation of cultural heritage: Terengganu brassware craft knowledge base,"Early exposure to cultural heritage is necessary to preserve it from extinction. One form of cultural heritage that is now on the brink of extinction is the Terengganu brassware craft. Current young generations are mostly not interested in this heritage. Furthermore, intangible heritage in the form of knowledge and skills are only stored in the memory of the practitioners. Lack of documentation has led to the sole reliance on practitioners such that the knowledge is lost upon their demise. Hence, intangible heritage knowledge has to be acquired and stored in a knowledge base system to keep them in a systematic and permanent form. Manipulating and transferring the knowledge and skills will also ensure the continuity of this heritage, and ensure it can be accessed by future generations. This paper discusses the development of the knowledge base of Terengganu Brassware Craft as a digital preservation of cultural heritage. Knowledge acquisition was carried out using interview and observation techniques. Then, the knowledge is represented using ontology. This knowledge, in digital form, can be manipulated and disseminated to the community to ensure the continuity of the knowledge. © 2019 International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications."

The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) models for such data centers are paramount to deeply understand their cost of investment and maintenance, the cost composition of internal components, and further cost optimization directions. Existing data center TCO models focus on either high-performance data centers or key subsystems such as IT facility, lacking of holistic analysis of the data centers designed for long-term data preservation. The long-term data centers can be built with different combinations of storage media such as HDDs, tapes, and optical discs. Meanwhile, during the long operation period, devices replacement and data migration are necessary and are not negligible in cost.In order to comprehensively and quantitatively understand the cost of long-term data preservations, we proposed LT-TCO, a TCO calculation model for data centers over time. LT-TCO simulates the construction and operation of a data center to calculate the expenditure of each year. It also introduces the cost of devices replacement and data migration during the long running period. Based on the storage media as optical discs, tapes, HDDs, and SSDs, LT-TCO evaluates the corresponding capital and operational expenditure under different developing rates. The simulation result shows that in long-term preservation, data migration cost takes more than 96% of the operational expenditure. And the TCO of optical disc data centers could be the least among four storage media. © 2019 IEEE."

Moreover, this paper proposes the technology framework of preservation for trusted electronic records. Also, the technology of blockchain, proofs of retrievability, the open archival information system model and erasure code are adopted to protect these four security attributes, to guarantee the credibility of the electronic record."
A.

Findings are reported from workplace observations and semi-structured interviews with preservationists (N = 25) as they implement software emulation programs in cultural heritage institutions that collect and preserve software for access. Results suggest that the distributed teams in this cohort of preservationists have developed different emulation practices for particular kinds of “emulation encounters” in supporting different types of use and users. I discuss the implications of these findings for digital preservation research and emulation initiatives providing access to software or software-dependent objects, showing how implications of these findings have significance for those developing software preservation workflows and building emulation capacities. This article suggests that there are different emulation practices for preservation, research access, and exhibition undertaken by preservationists in libraries, archives, and museums; and in examining particular visions of access these findings call into question software emulation as a single, static preservation strategy for cultural heritage institutions. © 2020, John Wiley and Sons Inc.

A. Acker; A. Kreisberg,2020,Social media data archives in an API-driven world,"In this article, we explore the long-term preservation implications of application programming interfaces (APIs) which govern access to data extracted from social media platforms. We begin by introducing the preservation problems that arise when APIs are the primary way to extract data from platforms, and how tensions fit with existing models of archives and digital repository development. We then define a range of possible types of API users motivated to access social media data from platforms and consider how these users relate to principles of digital preservation. We discuss how platforms’ policies and terms of service govern the set of possibilities for access using these APIs and how the current access regime permits persistent problems for archivists who seek to provide access to collections of social media data. We conclude by surveying emerging models for access to social media data archives found in the USA, including community driven not-for-profit community archives, university research repositories, and early industry–academic partnerships with platforms. Given the important role these platforms occupy in capturing and reflecting our digital culture, we argue that archivists and memory workers should apply a platform perspective when confronting the rich problem space that social platforms and their APIs present for the possibilities of social media data archives, asserting their role as “developer stewards” in preserving culturally significant data from social media platforms. © 2019, The Author(s)."

A. Kriesberg; J. Kowall,2020,Scientific data management in the federal government: A case study of NOAA and responsibility for preserving digital data,"In this paper, we examine the ways in which the evolution of federal and agency-specific data management policies has affected and continues to affect the long-term preservation of digital scientific data produced by the United States government. After reviewing the existing literature on the role of archival theory and practice in the preservation of scientific data, we present the case of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to analyze how data management activities at this agency are shaped by legislative mandates as well as both government-wide and agency-specific information-management policies. Through the connected network of law, federal policy, agency policy, and the records schedules which govern recordkeeping practice in the federal government, we propose a number of further questions on how government agencies can effectively provide for the management of scientific data as federal records. © 2020, John Wiley and Sons Inc.

A. L. Neatrour; J. Myntti; R. J. Wittmann,2020,Documenting contemporary regional history: the Utah COVID-19 digital collection,"Purpose: When faced with events, such as the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), libraries have a unique opportunity to develop a community facing response through born-digital collections. These collections provide challenges for metadata creation, collection development policies, workflows, and digital preservation. This paper aims to provide an overview of the Utah COVID-19 digital collection, with a discussion of impact and lessons learned. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides a case study of a born-digital collection initiative undertaken at the University of Utah in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project prompted engagement with the University of Utah communities and people across the state. Workflows, metadata management and partnerships are discussed, to provide a model for institutions developing similar projects during a time of crisis. Findings: While the project was launched with open-ended and flexible goals, the response from the community has been both surprising and gratifying. Statistics and examples demonstrating reuse of collection materials are provided to highlight the impact and potential of community engagement. Originality/value: Digital collecting projects during a historical event are not new, however the restrictions placed upon people worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic created interesting circumstances for building this collection. Several lessons were learned throughout the project which will be useful for other institutions embarking upon related projects. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."
A. L. Wiseman; F. Bezombes; A. J. Moore; I. De Groote,2020,Non-invasive methods: The applicability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology for recording fossilised footprints,"Hominin fossilised trackways are commonly used to reconstruct locomotory behaviour and to characterise track-maker biometrics. They are the most direct representation of hominin locomotion available, yet the fossil sites are susceptible to extreme cases of erosion and weathering, often resulting in the destruction of the fossil beds, as was the case at two prehistoric footprint sites: Formby Point and Happisburgh, UK. Footprints can also be found in easily deformable sediments where the excavator can unintentionally trample and destroy the prints, as occurred at Formby Point, UK. There is the need for non-destructive methods to be identified that can rapidly record the fossil area before further damage can occur to the fossil beds. Because current methods of 3D data capture (laser scanning or photogrammetry) can be invasive (i.e., the excavator is often required to trample the sediment layer during data capture), non-invasive methods need to be explored to circumvent issues in advertently destroying fossil material. In this project, a series of experiments using non-invasive methods tested the applicability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology combined with photogrammetry to rapidly and accurately record footprints before further damage to the fossil interface occurred. Various flight paths, UAVs, cameras and capture types (video versus camera stills) were incorporated to test the accuracy in minute depth reconstruction and subsequent 3D mesh creation of small, intricate detail. Shape and size, the consequence of poorly reconstructed depth dimensionality of surfaces, were found to be affected by flight path and by the height of the UAV, indicating that the most optimal method of recording tracks is to use a handheld DSLR camera following a circular or rastered flight path. Despite attempts to utilise UAV technology, inaccurate reconstructions of footprint topography were produced. Although UAV technology produced unreliable reconstructions, UAVs remain a technological solution when sites may be at immediate risk of destruction, as was the case at Happisburgh, UK. The deployment of UAV technology will permit the digital preservation of fossil material which would otherwise be lost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
A. M. Del Grosso; D. F. Fihri; M. El Mohajir; O. Nahli; A. Tonazzini,2020,Digital safeguard of laminated historical manuscripts: The treatise 'Poem in Rajaz on medicine' as a case study,"In this paper, we analyze and discuss the characteristics of a system for the effective digital preservation and fruition of historical manuscripts degraded by the process of lamination. As a case study, we will make reference to the 'Poem in Rajaz on medicine', written by Abubacer in the XII century, and conserved in the Al Quaraouiyine Library located in Fez, Morocco. The conceived system should have at least four main functionalities: image acquisition (i.e. digitization), image enhancement, text encoding, and linguistic analysis. Based on the evaluation of the manuscript damages, the acquisition set up should be designed in such a way to be able to avoid reflections as much as possible. Suitable digital image processing techniques should also be devised to correct the residual degradations and enhance the text for an easier legibility. Finally, semi-automatic transcription, scholarly encoding and linguistic analysis, to be performed on the virtually restored pages, should adapt existing tools to the specificity of the primary source writing system and language. The feasibility study for the realization of such a system is of general utility, in that it can provide guidelines for the digitization, the enhancement and the text encoding of the many laminated manuscripts conserved in other historical archives. On the other hand, from the cultural heritage point of view, the experimentation on the 'Poem in Rajaz on medicine' could foster the systematic philological and ontological study of a unique piece of our documental heritage: the longest poem of medieval Islamic medical literature. © 2021 IEEE."
A. Maximiliano Tello,2020,"ARCHIVING TECHNOLOGIES, PRIVATIZATION DISPOSITIVES AND AN-ARCHIVIST PRACTICES OF KNOWLEDGE. ON THE UNIVERSITY MUTATIONS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY","Th is article looks into some of the transformations that aff ect the contemporary university, underlining their close relationship with the emergence of digital archiving technologies. It is postulated that the process of massifi cation and globalization of the university is inseparable from the development of new knowledge registration technologies. Moreover, contrary to the celebratory discourses of digital networks, we seek to highlight the role of such technologies in the confi guration of devices for knowledge privatization, which subdue research and academic production to a new regime of capitalist data accumulation. We also set forth the forms of resistance against the new archontic power that manages knowledge records using archival technologies subversively. T us, it is concluded that the struggle for the university must also be understood as a struggle for the collectivization of knowledge registration technologies."

The implementation of the guidelines on digitization of resources in the libraries of HEIs in La Union, Philippines was found to be moderately implemented and is relatively weak. A Digitization Manual Model was formulated to address the identified weaknesses. Through these guidelines and procedures, library personnel will have clear guidelines as to how digitization activities must be done. It will serve as a framework that will provide effective and efficient digitization. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021."
A. Ponza; S. Scannapieco; A. Simone; C. Tomazzoli,2020,Envisioning the digital transformation of financial documents: A blockchain-based bill of exchange,"A Bill of Exchange (BoE) is a paper-written contract involving three parties A, B and C where A is economically in debt with B and in credit with C. Once the parties approve a BoE, C is legally bound to pay B on behalf of A within a set deadline, so that the debt of A towards B is extinguished. Although regarded as an elegant and powerful variant of a promissory note, over time the BoE has become unpractical to use in a global market where suppliers and customers aren’t next-door companies anymore. On the other hand, the blockchain distributed ledger, AES authentication, and digital archiving with suitable long-period standards (e.g., PDF/A) may encourage the revival of such an instrument, while ensuring legal validity, strength and a non-tampering warranty. This paper exploits said state-of-the-art technologies to bring the paper-based BoE into the digital era as the DigiBoE. Its envisioned applications are B2B, C2C and B2C secure and legally acknowledged transactions for debt resolution no longer requiring financial intermediaries. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."

The findings indicate the viewpoints of professionals who work in the cultural heritage sector on the development of TBA as a distinct specialisation within conservation, and advance discussions of cultural, institutional and structural barriers embedded in working cultures, practices and attitudes. This paper posits that the very nature of TBA requires a reassessment of traditional institutional roles and workflows, new types of technical knowledge and the development of a supportive network of practice. © The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Materials 2020."
A. Shibambu; M. Ngoepe,2020,When rain clouds gather: Digital curation of South African public records in the cloud,"Background: Many scholars lament of poor infrastructure for the management and preservation of digital records in the public sector in South Africa. For example, in South Africa, the national archives repository and its subsidiary provincial archives do not have infrastructure to ingest digital records into archival custody. As a result, digital records are left to the creating agencies to manage and preserve. The problem is compounded by the fact that very few public sector organisations in South Africa have procured systems to manage digital records.Objective: This study investigated whether government departments in South Africa entrust their records to cloud storage. The study asked the questions: How are digital records managed and stored in these organisations? Do government departments entrust their records to the cloud as an alternative storage?Method: Qualitative data were collected through interviews with purposively chosen chief information officers, records managers and IT managers from public entities that implemented e-government services, as well as officials from the National Archives and Services of South Africa, which is charged with the statutory regulatory role of records management in governmental bodies and the State Information Technology Agency, a public sector Information Communication Technology (ICT) company established in 1999 to consolidate and coordinate the state's information technology resources.Results: The key findings suggest that although public servants informally and unconsciously save some records in the cloud, government departments in South Africa are sceptical to entrust their records in the cloud because of a number of reasons such as lack of trust in the cloud storage, jurisdiction, legal implications, privacy and security risks related to Minimum Information Security Standards, as well as lack of policy and legislative framework, specifically regarding cloud storage.Conclusion: Because of lack of infrastructure for management and preservation of digital records, for the purpose of increased storage and access, this study recommends that government departments should cautiously consider exploring the possibility of storing their records in a trusted digital repository cloud as an interim solution whilst observing legal obligations. As cloud storage is not very prevalent amongst government departments in South Africa, given the present challenges in managing digital records, it would be advantageous to have cloud storage tested rigorously before embarking on the exercise."

Wikle,2020,Scalable born digital ingest workflows for limited resources: A case study for first steps in digital preservation,"This article seeks to provide an example of a scalable and achievable born digital ingest workflow for cultural heritage institutions of any size, including those with limited funding. Like many small archives, the University of Idaho (U of I) Library Special Collections and Archives (SPEC) has accepted born digital material when it arrives as part of analog collections for the last 20 years. However, the Library has faced numerous challenges similar to those of other small institutions when developing workflows for born digital preservation and ingest. These include lack of funding, systems, and policies. Despite a growing number of resources that support digital preservation work, among current best practices it is difficult to find scalable workflows for institutions with limited staff and funds. By implementing accessible open-source software and prioritizing preservation tasks, U of I Library has developed a low-cost way to implement systems for digital preservation with responsibilities that can be spread out among librarians and archivists with varying technical expertise. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020."

A. Wareham; T. Dellinger; J. Sonnberger; A. Columbus; G. Vogeler,2020,The 'confronting the digital' debate and an assertive digital edition: British history and hearth tax records,"This article contributes to the 'Confronting the Digital' debate by setting out the case for using the methods of an 'assertive' digital edition to enrich historical research and to make archives accessible to a range of users. It illustrates its case with data modelling, data analysis and personal stories arising from the use of digital resources derived from the British hearth tax records (1662-95). Parts 1-2 address the nature of the debate for academia, libraries and archives, and their relationships with commercial organizations. Parts 3-4 explore the work of ScotlandsPlaces and Hearth Tax Digital, setting out the methods of an assertive digital edition in enhancing record access, research and long-term preservation, and assesses the benefits for academic research. Parts 5-6 demonstrate how this work has enhanced life skills and increases peoples' confidence outside the academic world through research undertaken in schools and colleges and by the University of the Third Age. The article shows that an assertive edition approach brings considerable benefits to the study of pre-modern sources dispersed across archives, thereby enabling historians and other users to conduct qualitative and quantitative research both within and outside academia on communities and ordinary people from the early modern period. This not only enhances research knowledge but also increases confidence among diverse groups. © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON INSTANTIATION ENTITY IN 'RECORDS IN CONTEXTS' MODEL""","This paper seeks to compare the use of different, but apparently synonym terms, like Instantiation, Manifestation or Representation, terms used in different models and projects in library, archives and digital preservation. For the comparison, we reviewed the definitions and examples in several authoritative documents, like PREMIS, FRBR, Records in Contexts etc. This exercise revealed that similar words may have different usage in different context, which make it hard to use one term to communicate the same meaning for everybody.

However, the increase of data storage capacity is much slower than that of data generation. How to store and archive such a huge amount of data becomes critical and challenging. Synthetic Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) storage is one of the promising candidates with high density and long-term preservation for archival storage systems. The existing works have focused on the achievable feasibility of a small amount of data when using DNA as storage. In this paper, we investigate the scalability and potentials of DNA storage when a huge amount of data, like all available data from the world, is to be stored. First, we investigate the feasible storage capability that can be achieved in a single DNA pool/tube based on current and future technologies. Then, the indexing of DNA storage is explored. Finally, the metadata overhead based on future technology trends is also investigated. © HotStorage 2020 - 12th USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems, co-located with USENIX ATC 2020.

Anderson,2020,Preservation and archiving of digital media,"This paper provides a brief history of the Vanderbilt Television News Archive that was established in 1968 with the goal of recording and preserving national news programming on the three major networks at the time (ABC, NBC, and CBS). The archive has faced several challenges as it evolved (it now covers representative news from the Fox and CNN cable networks)-most notably financial and legal issues-who really 'owns' the news? Even today archiving digital news remains financially and legally challenged as the number of news networks increase and privacy laws emerge, resulting in the creation of 'piracy archives'. The author also touches on the many ongoing issues that need to be addressed; e.g.The number of copies to be created, the importance of metadata, the technical requirements, what qualifies for preservation, and the ever-present issue of sustainability. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

C. Becker; E. Maemura; N. Moles,2020,The Design and Use of Assessment Frameworks in Digital Curation,"To understand and improve their current abilities and maturity, organizations use diagnostic instruments such as maturity models and other assessment frameworks. Increasing numbers of these are being developed in digital curation. Their central role in strategic decision making raises the need to evaluate their fitness for this purpose and develop guidelines for their design and evaluation. A comprehensive review of assessment frameworks, however, found little evidence that existing assessment frameworks have been evaluated systematically, and no methods for their evaluation. This article proposes a new methodology for evaluating the design and use of assessment frameworks. It builds on prior research on maturity models and combines analytic and empirical evaluation methods to explain how the design of assessment frameworks influences their application in practice, and how the design process can effectively take this into account. We present the evaluation methodology and its application to two frameworks. The evaluation results lead to guidelines for the design process of assessment frameworks in digital curation. The methodology provides insights to the designers of the evaluated frameworks that they can consider in future revisions; methodical guidance for researchers in the field; and practical insights and words of caution to organizations keen on diagnosing their abilities. © 2019 ASIS&T"

To do this, we used the Internet Archive's Wayback machine to investigate the original presentation and all subsequent changes to the interfaces of a small sample of projects. The study addresses the following questions: What can we learn from a study of interfaces to DH material? How have interfaces to DH materials changed over the course of their existence? Do these changes affect the way the resource is used, and the way it conveys meaning? Should we preserve interfaces for future scholarship? We show that a valuable information may be derived from the interfaces of long-lived projects. Visual design can communicate subtle messages about the way the resource was originally conceived by its creators and subsequent changes show how knowledge of user behaviour developed in the DH community. Interfaces provide information about the intellectual context of early digital projects. They can also provide information about the changing place of DH projects in local and national infrastructures, and the way that projects have sought to survive in challenging funding environments. © The Author(s) 2019.

D. Della Corte; W. Colsman; B. Welker; B. Rennick,2020,Library eArchiving with ZONTAL Space and the Allotrope Data Format,"Purpose: The purpose of this technical paper is to evaluate the emerging standard “Allotrope Data Format (ADF)” in the context of digital preservation at a major US academic library hosted at Brigham Young University. In combination with the new information management system ZONTAL Space (ZS), archiving with the ADF is compared with currently used systems CONTENTdm and ROSETTA. Design/methodology/approach: The approach is a workflow-based comparison in terms of usability, functionality and reliability of the systems. Current workflows are replaced by optimized target processes, which limit the number of involved parties and process steps. The connectors or manual solutions between the current workflow steps are replaced with automatic functions inside of ZS. Reporting functionalities inside of ZS are used to track system and file lifecycle to ensure stability and data preservation. Findings: The authors find that the target processes leveraging ZS drastically reduce complexity compared to current workflows. Archiving with the ADF is found to decrease integration complexity and provide a more robust data migration path for the future. The possibility to enrich data automatically with metadata and to store this information alongside the content in the same information package increases reusability of the data. Research limitations/implications: The practical implications of this work suggest the arrival of a new information management system that can potentially revolutionize the archiving landscape within libraries. Beyond the scope of the initial proof of concept, the potential for the system can be seen to replace existing data management tools and provide access to new data analytics applications, like smart recommender systems. Originality/value: The value of this study is a systematic introduction of ZS and the ADF, two emerging solutions from the Pharmaceutical Industry, to the broader audience of digital preservation experts within US libraries. The authors consider the exchange of best practices and solutions between industries to be of high value to the communities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

D. P. Srirahayu; D. Harisanty; M. S. Irfana,2020,Readiness For Digital Preservation in Indonesia,"Libraries using institutional repositories aim to manage and preserve digital content. As digital collection providers, they must be prepared to face various problems, especially policy issues regarding how digital collections can develop and can meet user needs in a relatively long time (long-term use). The problem that will be faced is the age of data storage media which can only last at least 10 years so that digital collections must be copied again to reduce the possibility of losing the information contained in digital collections. This problem is one of the reasons for the digital preservation of repository digital collections which are intellectual and cultural property as well as assets for the repository itself. This preservation is a form of organizational readiness in maintaining the existence of the library and preserving the collection so that it has a long term of use. This research uses descriptive quantitative method with a random sampling process with 100 respondents netted in the webometric. Library readiness in digital preservation reaches the consolidate stage, repository institution consolidates its resources for the development of digital preservation. The factors included in this readiness are organizational infrastructure, technological infrastructure, and resources. © 2020. All Rights Reserved."

Contra the cultural imaginary of the flâneur as a figure of pleasure, I suggest that practices of flânerie generate an experience of displacement and angst. With reference to Martin Heidegger’s concept of the unheimlich (uncanny), I characterize being in a web archive as immersive but anxiously placeless. I then rely on Heidegger again to identify a productively dispositional role for rhetoric in digital archiving. As logos, rhetoric builds a structure, or “dwelling,” that might provide orientation and make the archival unheimlich tolerable. The essay’s implications pertain to the conditions of inhabitability in networked culture, which by design is functionally archival. © 2020 National Communication Association."
E. Jung,2020,A Tamper-Proof Digital Archiving Scheme Based on Blockchain,"Every society has given a lot of efforts to preserve knowledge for its heritage and the activity is still going on in modern society. The preservation of knowledge in modern society mainly depends on digital technology, unlike previous eras. Digital data is very useful in many respects such as easy transfer or outstanding reusability, but it is not adequate for data preservation because it can be easily modified, vanished, or replaced without notice. In order to resolve this issue, we propose a tamper-proof digital archiving scheme with Blockchain which protects archived data from malicious counterfeiting and guarantees the fidelity of archived data. In the evaluation, the system shows that it is robust to possible forgeries. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

F. Bressan; R. L. Hess,2020,Non-Standard track configuration in historical audio recordings: Technical and philological consequences for preservation,"This article discusses a specific moment in the preservation of audio recordings, and magnetic tapes in particular, namely the identification of the track configuration. This identification is necessary to perform a correct signal extraction before proceeding with the digital encoding, and cultural re-encoding, of the acoustic information. The main value in this work resides in the considerations that show how technical challenges and choices determine the output both from technical and cultural points of view. These considerations should be relevant to audio experts as well as to archivists and archive managers, in that they illustrate how a technical issue has implications on the preservation planning, the allocation of resources, and on the end output - the digital preservation master. Two sound archives are presented as a case study. The archives are a good example of unusual tracks configurations with multiple speed changes. This work contributes to the long-term goal of building a coherent body of work in audio preservation, showing the interdependence of technical and cultural choices before, during, and after the process of re-mediation and re-articulation of audio documents. © 2020 Music Library Association.

Anyhow the project left one face of the picture uncovered. The aim of this paper is to stimulate further discussions related to digitised documentation and digital cultural assets safety either if they are digital born or reproduction of real ones. In 2003, UNESCO released the Charter on the Preservation of Digital Heritage""[ 1], which defines digital heritage as ""made up of computer-based materials of enduring value that should be kept for future generations (UNESCO 2003)"". Digital heritage emanates from different communities, industries, sectors and regions. Not all digital material is of enduring value, but a paramount volume of digital objects, especially the digital documentation related to cultural heritage, require active preservation approaches regardless the technology evolution.. It should be a priority to preserve that digital patrimony as well as to preserve the physical one. For this reason we aggregate the two view points in the ""Digital heritage"". The challenge is represented by the preservation from one side of the digital born objects (including all the cultural heritage documentation), from the other objects coming from the conversion of existing/disappeared ones, must be protected and preserved. We are facing day by day a wider scenario where gallery, library, archive, and museum (GLAM)[2] dependence from digital content preservation is growing so the need for a lifecycle management of digital materials is necessary to ensure their continuity."""
G. Bhaumik; M. C. Govil,2020,Buddhist Hasta Mudra Recognition Using Morphological Features,"Mudras are considered as spiritual gestures in the religious sense and hold a very important place in the cultural and spiritual space in India. Images are the symbolic representations of divinity in religious artwork and their origins are conveyed through the religions and spiritual beliefs. Such gestures also have some specific meaning in the Buddhist religion. It refers to some of the events in the life of Buddha or denotes special characteristics of the Buddha deities. In recent years, automatic identification of these gestures has gained a greater interest from the machine learning community. This would help to identify the various deities that exist in the Buddhist religion, leading to digital preservation of cultural heritage art. This paper provides a framework that recognizes the Buddhist hand gesture or Hasta Mudra. The morphological features are extracted from the gesture employing geometric parameters. The experimental results show that utilising geometric features and using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) as a classifier, an approximately 70% recognition rate is achieved. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

J. C. Ramalho; B. Ferreira; L. Faria; M. Ferreira,2020,Beyond Relational Databases: Preserving the Data,"Relational databases are one of the main technologies supporting information assets in today’s organizations. They are designed to store, organize and retrieve digital information, and are such a fundamental part of information systems that most would not be able to function without them. Very often, the information contained in databases is irreplaceable or prohibitively expensive to reacquire; therefore, steps must be taken to ensure that the information within databases is preserved. This paper describes a methodology for long-term preservation of relational databases based on information extraction and format migration to a preservation format. It also presents a tool that was developed to support this methodology: Database Preservation Toolkit (DBPTK), as well as the processes and formats needed to preserve databases. The DBPTK connects to live relational databases and extracts information into formats more adequate for long-term preservation. Supported preservation formats include the SIARD 2, created by a cooperation between the Swiss Federal Archives and the E-ARK project that is becoming a standard in the area. DBPTK has a flexible plugin-based architecture enabling its use for other purposes like database upgrade and database migration between different systems. Presented real case scenarios demonstrate the usefulness, correctness and performance of the tool. © 2021 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Also, this paper proposes the implementation of digital documentation tool that allows retrieval, organization, systematization and preservation of visual contents. Design/methodology/approach: Semiotic analysis based on 44 artistic pieces (images and videos) posted on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to protest in Venezuela against the government of Nicolás Maduro in 2017. The authors defined a metadata group for content creation of multimedia and testing information retrieval from general data, textual contents, file formats and semiotic description using Omeka software. Findings: The digital documentation of artivism proposed has the potential to sustain over time as documents likely to be studied. It also constitutes an important analysis and a historical reconstruction, which must be taken into consideration to conduct research in the future political and social process of Venezuela. Social implications: Cyber-artivism, a concept related to online activism, is conceived as an artistic expression mediated by technologies and social media emerging in the context of social environments with a political–demographic character. Originality/value: Digital preservation of multimedia contents by their semiotic and historic value as artistic cyber-activism. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Kaminski,2020,The Application of E-ARK Tools for Archival Interoperability to Support a Long-term Sustainable Digital Single Market,"European Union support for the development of digital cross-border means for conducting business and running governments has fundamentally changed how public and private business is conducted. But this digital information has to remain available for long periods, often beyond the life expectancy of individual information systems or technological components. This poses a significant challenge for both the original data creators and digital archives that have to be capable of both dealing with the most current information technology, and with “saving” information from legacy systems. To deal with these challenges, it is necessary to bridge the gap between the methods used in digital preservation and content creation and introduce additional practical interoperability into the solutions used for a Digital Single Market and digital preservation infrastructures. The European Commission recognized the need in 2013 and funded the E-ARK project (2014–2017), which successfully delivered a set of principles, specifications and tools that provided an interoperable and international solution for the sustainable long-term availability of digital information. This paper describes the solutions developed by the E-ARK project, focusing on the SIP format, as well as the steps the European Commission is taking toward building a thriving digital preservation community around the E-ARK outcomes. © 2021 The Author(s).

K. Fisher,2020,Copyright and Preservation of Born-digital Materials: Persistent Challenges and Selected Strategies,"This article surveys and analyzes archival literature and legal resources (primarily United States-focused) related to copyright considerations that archivists and other content managers must be aware of to effectively and legally maintain a collection of born-digital materials. These considerations include the centrality of copying to preservation actions, shifting definitions of ownership, unclear distinctions between published and unpublished content, digital rights management laws and technologies, and the layered copyrights that can exist in complex digital objects and their dependencies. Strategies for dealing with these challenges include securing rights ahead of time, adopting legal rationales related to orphan works and fair use, adapting practices from specialized digital preservation subfields, ensuring routine procedures adequately address copyright-related recordkeeping and risk management, and advocating for preservation-enabling copyright reforms. An examination of these issues and strategies in the context of current thinking about copyright suggests that while certain legal exceptions and existing rights frameworks can help to facilitate digital preservation activities, copyright will continue to be a barrier until significant reforms are enacted. © 2020 Society of American Archivists.

K. M. W. Freire; L. F. Sales; L. F. Sayão,2020,The digital curation in the artistic and cultural context: Reuse possibilities of art data,"Objective: Through the initiative of various institutions, many cultural collections have been digitized, generating material that has great potential for reuse. These digital art data valuable assets that, stored in repositories in cultural institutions, need visibility and dynamism. This research seeks to identify what are the types of reuse performed in cultural institutions, based on the principles of Digital Curation. Methods: The research starts from a specific sample of aggregators / institutions present in Europeana Collections. From specific stipulated requirements, four institutions were selected. A survey of existing practices was carried out, as well as its subsequent systematization into seven categories based on the Digital Curation literature, namely: Aggregations, Collaborative Space, Online Curation, Education, Scientific Research, Computer Applications and Commercial Services. Results: It was found that one of the four selected institutions practices all categories of reuse and the other institutions practice three or more of the investigated activities. Sixteen types of reuse of art data were identified, such as: Production of materials derived from images, reinterpretations, fields for comments, algorithmic recommendation programming through data provided by the visitor, online exhibitions with internal and external/collaborative curation, etc. Conclusions: The expansion to the digital world of the collections of cultural institutions results in new possibilities of services, products, entertainment, educational action and research. Moreover, they create a closer relationship and interaction with the public, stimulating local visitation. That expansion provides contact with valuable collections, taking the elite status away from large collections and promoting the visibility of collections of local cultures. It can also foster the creative industry and enhance the work of the information units belonging to cultural institutions. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina. All rights reserved."

Popp,2020,Preservation and Access for Born-digital Electronic Records: The Case for an Institutional Digital Content Format Registry,"Since 2014, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library has taken custody of a growing number of collections of born-digital"" records, largely through the University Archives. These collections comprise a panoply of digital content formats, ranging from those in common use to obscure varieties from the early days of personal computing. As such, they pose a challenge to digital preservation and access. Knowing what software to use to open files in formats that have fallen out of use is often difficult, let alone installing obsolete software on contemporary operating systems. At the same time, the sheer bulk of collections, as well as an accelerating rate of born-digital accessions from faculty and campus offices, makes it difficult to assess these files at the time of acquisition. These challenges suggest the need for preservation policies on digital formats in collections of electronic records, as well as for firsthand knowledge of the software required to facilitate curator control over and patron access to these collections. This article presents an overview of an evolving approach taken by archivists and librarians at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to build the policies, technical knowledge, and systems for an effective preservation and access program for electronic records. Their implementation of a local digital content format registry, while young, suggests that archivists and digital preservationists would benefit from further development of tools and practices focused on born-digital formats, and the thoughtful integration of institutional knowledge with international format registries. © 2020 Society of American Archivists.

In the context of open science and e-science, information science investigates solutions to the challenges of treating and using information. The current lack of knowledge of the importance of digital curation activities of scientific data and the degree of adherence to this new scenario, cause difficulties for the information professional to adapt in this context and contribute solutions to the challenges of digital curation. It aims to investigate the importance that the digital curation activities of scientific data have for the area of Information Science in Brazil, in face of the international trend of scientific knowledge management. Methodology: The research follows a quantitative approach, it is applied in nature and exploratory and descriptive. It uses procedures of a survey with Survey, to obtain information from the Digital Curator through the opinion of Brazilian researchers in the area of Information Science. Results: The information analyzed reveals that the field of Brazilian Information Science is seeking to adapt in this scenario. Conclusions: The data allow us to affirm that there is not a sufficiently assimilated awareness by the researchers of Information Science regarding the need for more conscious and committed involvement in Digital Curation activities.

Objectives-It is intended to discuss the relevant issues regarding the costs of digital curation and to develop a framework model proposal for the analysis of costs in digital curation, including projects of a more practical nature. This means addressing the concept definition and the issue of costs, based on studies related to cost models. Methodology-A literature review was carried out, contextualizing the issue of costs within digital curation, with data collected from Biblioteca do Conhecimento Online – B-On (Online Knowledge Library) and Repositórios Científicos de Acesso Aberto de Portugal – RCAAP (Scientific Open Access Repository of Portugal) as research literature sources. Then, a framework model scheme was developed based on the categories identified using the Constant Comparative Method, some related to the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model and to the Digital Curation Centre (DCC) Life Cycle. This allowed the development of a content analysis of the perceptions collected from different authors, resulting in memos, of which this text is a summary. Results / Conclusion-It is proposed a systematization of digital curation issues, which constitutes a framework model considered relevant for the analysis of costs in digital curation, including practical projects, which interconnects the DCC Life Cycle view of the digital object curation to the OAIS Reference Model approach, in a transversal logic seized by the cost models and plan/data management policies. It is concluded that a paradigm shift is occurring from a black-box perspective to another one that identifies costs and attempts to standardise predictive models for institutional use with the aim of promoting transparency, accountability, and capturing the interest of potential funding providers. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Missori,2020,Diagnostic study of ancient Durium phonographic discs,"Sound recording and reproducing were first obtained by T. A. Edison in 1877 by inventing the phonograph cylinder. In 1929 a technology to produce phonograph discs based on the coating of a cardboard substrate with phenol-formaldehyde resin, impressed in order to form sound grooves, was introduced in the United States of America. The commercial name of such discs was Durium and they soon became a cheaper and more easily used alternative of the shellac and bakelite used for traditional record productions. The Institute for Sound and Audiovisual Heritage (ICBSA) of the Italian Minister of Cultural Heritage and Tourism holds a collection of about 1500 Durium discs produced in the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy dated from the '30s to the '50s. However, in most cases, such Durium discs have shown overtime strong bending deformations that make them unreadable with the classic turntables. Therefore a project started aimed at the chemical, physical and morphological study of the constituent materials of the discs for the planning of innovative procedures for their restoration with the final goal of their digital preservation. Here we report on the non-destructive analysis based on ultraviolet-visible and infrared spectroscopies for the characterization of the constituent materials of the Durium discs owned by ICBSA. Quantitative information on the morphology of the different layers and grooves has been obtained by microscopic imaging, laser scanning confocal microscopy and by an innovative Terahertz imaging approach. Results confirmed the presence of a phenolic resin, as the resorcinol-formaldehyde one, for the Durium layer. The analysis also showed the chemical homogeneity of materials employed in the production of discs, even if produced in different countries and at different times. The Durium layer was found to be about 110 mu m thin, while cardboard is about 600 mu m thick, suggesting the important role of the latter one in the bending deformations. In addition, inhomogeneities were found in the overall thickness of discs, most likely due to the carboard layer thickness variation. Overall these results provide useful information for the planning of restoration interventions suitable for such sound heritage made by coupling cardboard and plastic material.

Cox,2020,Information school academics and the value of their personal digital archives,"Introduction.This paper explores the value that academics in an information school assign to their digital files and how this relates to their personal information management and personal digital archiving practices.Method. An interpretivist qualitative approach was adopted with data from in-depth interviews and participant-led tours of their digital storage space.Analysis. The approach taken was thematic analysis. Results. Participants placed little value on their digital material beyond the value of its immediate use. They did not attach worth to their digital files for reuse by others, for sentiment, to project their identity or for the study of the development of the discipline or the study of the creative process. This was reflected in storage and file-naming practices, and the lack of curatorial activity. Conclusions. This paper is one of the first to investigate academics' personal information management and personal digital archiving practices, especially to focus on the value of digital possessions. The paper begins to uncover the importance of wider contextual factors in shaping such practices. Institutions need to do more to encourage academics to recognise the diverse types of value in the digital material they create. © 2020, University of Boras. All rights reserved."

Currently, there are criteria defined by international standards regarding the certification of these repositories. In some countries in North America and Europe institutions are dedicated to assisting in the acquisition of the certification seal, building standards and requirements for the analysis of repositories. Thus, the present article discusses the concept of trusted digital repositories and their exploration by the national and international literature. A qualitative research was carried out, using as a method the systematic review in five databases of the Information Science area, with the objective of identifying the application of the studies in the national and international scenario and to map the authors, periodicals and countries that have explored the concept and how the theme has been worked on. The results point out that the theme is recent, with productions made from 2001. There is a predominance of citations in documents that deal with conceptual aspects and the implementation of digital preservation. It can be affirmed that it is still a little explored subject, because, although it is pointed out by a large number of authors, there is no predominance of specialists in the publication of documents on the subject. According to the authors' affiliation, the countries that most published were the United States of America, Canada, Brazil, Portugal and England, but there was representation of countries from all continents of the globe. © 2020 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.

Research data management is the basis for efficiency, continuity, and quality of the research, as well as for maximum impact and outreach, including the long-term publication of data and their accessibility. Both funding agencies and publishers increasingly require this long term and open access to research data. Joint environmental studies typically take place in a fragmented research landscape of diverse disciplines; researchers involved typically show a variety of attitudes towards and previous experiences with common data policies, and the extensive variety of data types in interdisciplinary research poses particular challenges for collaborative data management. In this paper, we present organizational measures, data and metadata management concepts, and technical solutions to form a flexible research data management framework that allows for efficiently sharing the full range of data and metadata among all researchers of the project, and smooth publishing of selected data and data streams to publicly accessible sites. The concept is built upon data type-specific and hierarchical metadata using a common taxonomy agreed upon by all researchers of the project. The framework's concept has been developed along the needs and demands of the scientists involved, and aims to minimize their effort in data management, which we illustrate from the researchers' perspective describing their typical workflow from the generation and preparation of data and metadata to the long-term preservation of data including their metadata."

These differences have an impact on the amount and detail of information captured by each technique, the human and material resources necessary for each technique, maintenance, and long-term care for the digital surrogates generated. The desire for digitizing cultural heritage materials must be linked to programs for the preservation of the materials being digitized and the preservation of all the digital files generated by digitization. The institution needs to find the balance between the resulting quality and quantity of the materials that will be digitized and what is possible to sustain in the long term through these processes. When we want the great, this can be the enemy of the good. The good can be done in the best way and be great. It is also possible to work with projects ranging from good to great according to decisions and selections made by the institution on how to deal with digital preservation, digitization, access and preservation in the long term. We want the best for our institutions and collections, and we aim for efficient dissemination programs using the materials generated by digitization.

N. C. Tai; L. W. Sung,2020,Digital archiving of perceptual experiences of an architectural space with computer-aided methods,"The importance of the preservation of historical heritage has been valued and emphasized, and efforts to achieve this have been continually made in many countries. Historical architecture is always in danger of being damaged or demolished by natural or man-made causes. Therefore, documenting heritage buildings with drawings and photos is important for archiving and preserving cultural heritage. Advances in digital imaging technologies such as photogrammetric modeling have enabled measurements of architectural heritage with high precision. However, the data archived for historical heritage still focuses on the physical properties of the architecture and less on the spatial perception of the visitor. The goal of this study is to develop a methodology to use technologies of digital photography to record the visual perception of an architectural scene that can invoke the perceptual memory of the heritage building. Hypotheses of frequency and maximal information were explored to identify the canonical perspective views of an architectural space. Behavioral mapping and a computer-aided method of Space Syntax were used to identify the canonical perspective views based on these two hypotheses. Perceptual studies were conducted, and the result revealed that the most frequently viewed scenes identified by behavioral mapping were most representative when subjects were asked to recall the architectural space. Meanwhile, computational analysis performed by Space Syntax can identify a location that is most frequently viewed and can view the most space. Possible methods to utilize technologies of digital photography to archive the perceptual experiences of an architectural space based on the viewpoint identified by the two approaches are proposed in this paper. © 2020 CAD Solutions, LLC."

Storage areas protect collections and provides sustainability for the collection management. In this context, one of the main duties of museums is to maintain and manage collections in storage area under appropriate and safe conditions. Most of the museums in the world exhibit only a small percentage of their collections and so many collection items are housed in storage.

N. Mnjama,2020,Preserving endangered archives through open access: The role of the endangered archive programme in Africa,"Archives and manuscript collections, when well preserved, play a pivotal role in the preservation of corporate memory as well as the transmission of culture, building of national identity, and in providing valuable information sources on a variety of issues. However, in many parts of the world, the preservation and accessibility of archives and manuscripts, particularly those privately held, remains a neglected area requiring innovative ways to enhance their long-term preservation and accessibility. This chapter examines how endangered archival collections can be preserved through open access and digitization programmes funded locally or jointly with donor agencies. Specifically, the chapter examines the contribution made by the Endangered Archives Programme, a UK-based programme supported by Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin, to preserve endangered archives in Africa. The chapter shows that over the past 16 years, the Endangered Archives Programme has made a significant contribution in the preservation of endangered archives held privately and in public archival institutions. The chapter argues that the approach followed by the Endangered Archives Programme clearly demonstrates that collaborative effort in the preservation of endangered archives results in mutual benefits to the local communities as well the research community via the British Library. The chapter concludes by suggesting future directions that may be considered when undertaking similar copying projects. © 2021, IGI Global."
N. Moles,2020,Open government data (OGD): challenging the concept of a “Designated Community”,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the curation of government-produced datasets for release as open government data (OGD) from the perspective of the digital curation and preservation concept of a “Designated Community”. Specifically, it explores how digital curation functions when there is no clear Designated Community to which curation services can be targeted. Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted through a case study of the City of Toronto’s efforts to revitalize their OGD program. Data was collected using three methods: semi-structured interviews, non-participative observation and document analysis. Findings: The curators of OGD responded to the absence of a Designated Community through two complementary methods. The first was to draw from the discourse that defines the OGD domain. The second was to take a participatory approach that incorporated members of the community surrounding OGD and various other stakeholders into the process of developing a plan for the revitalization of the program. Research limitations/implications: This study opens new directions for investigating the application of the Designated Community concept and its role in digital curation and preservation. Practical implications: The approach used by OGD curators in this case has the potential to be used in other curation situations where there is no clearly defined user group. Originality/value: The findings presented in this paper contribute empirical insights to on-going discussions on the concept of a Designated Community in digital curation and preservation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Mak Yong, an intangible cultural heritage of humanity, claimed as one of 43 cultural masterpieces by UNESCO in 2008. However, since then many scholars have expressed their anxiety for the diminishing Mak Yong troupes. Furthermore, serious effort to safeguard the folk dance is still lacking eventhough the advancement of digital technology is great in this era. Under this circumstances, Motion Capture (MoCap) technology was applied in this study in order to record the Mak Yong dance expression data digitally, considering that the accuracy potential is significantly high. The Laban theory is then applied accompanied by the Aesthetic Experience (AX) theory as incorporating these two theories would provide a significant foundation. This is to ensusre that the digital preservation process of Mak Yong would satisfy both kinesthetic and aesthetic functions of the dance. Suggested framework will be produced at the end of the study through an initial observation of the concepts which recapitulates in this study. In conclusion, this framework will be of a great help to the future study of Malay folk dance in order to preserve its valuable cultural heritage in digital form. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

We use 3D printed replicas to qualitatively assure the volumes, and show that, with a mean deviation (based on eight samples) of 0.059% compared to proven geotechnical methods, the photogrammetric output is found to be equivalent. We furthermore splice together broken and fragmented core pieces to reconstruct larger core intervals. We unwrap these to generate and characterise 2D orthographic projections of the core edge using analytical workflows developed for the structure-sedimentological characterisation of virtual outcrop models. Drill core orthoprojections can be treated as directly correlatable to optical borehole-wall imagery data, enabling a direct and cost-effective elucidation of in situ drill core orientation and depth, as long as any form of borehole imagery is available. Digital drill core models are thus complementary to existing physical and photographic sample archives, and we foresee that the presented workflow can be adopted for the digitisation and digital storage of other types of geological samples, including degradable and dangerous ice and sediment cores and samples."

Furfuri,2020,Librarians’ perception of disaster preparedness as precursor for effective preservation and conservation of library resources in Nigerian university libraries,"The study examined librarians' perception of disaster preparedness and its effect on effective preservation and conservation of library resources, focusing on university libraries in the Southwest geopolitical zone of Nigeria. The survey research design was adopted. The university libraries that provided the data and institutional setting for the study were randomized using the ballot system after which total enumeration technique was employed to take complete census of the population. The population comprised 327 librarians and library officers drawn across federal and state university libraries in the region. The questionnaire and interview methods were used for data collection. Results affirmed, as postulated, that preservation and conservation of information resources would be more effective if disaster preparedness measures are incorporated into the process. As a result, both approaches were found to be complementary. It was also discovered that the core digital preservation strategies are not being practiced in university libraries in the studied region. Consequently, it was recommended that effort aimed at all forms of preservation strategies should be employed to ensure the longevity and sustainability of all information resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

P. O. R. Reséndiz,2020,Ibero-american network of digital preservation of sound and audiovisual archives: An alternative of scientific collaboration,"A sustainable digital preservation is the main challenge for sound and audiovisual archives of all types and dimensions. In many cases, collections have not yet been digitized, and in addition the archives do not have methods to preserve born digital documents. Archives that have digitized their collections confront henceforth the challenge of having digital archives. In Iberoamerica, and in particular in Latin American countries, the risk of losing sound and audiovisual media is an urgent problem that affects materials recorded on analog carriers and born digital materials. An alternative to this situation is scientific collaboration. Therefore, this article presents the background and perspectives of the Ibero-American Network for Digital Preservation of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (RIPDASA) created to identify, analyse, give visibility and disseminate sustainable digital preservation alternatives for the archives of the region. This initiative intends to reduce the risk of loss of such cultural heritage and thereby, ensure its access for both current and future generations.

P. T. Darch; A. E. Sands; C. L. Borgman; M. S. Golshan,2020,Library cultures of data curation: Adventures in astronomy,"University libraries are partnering with disciplinary data producers to provide long-term digital curation of research data sets. Managing data set producer expectations and guiding future development of library services requires understanding the decisions libraries make about curatorial activities, why they make these decisions, and the effects on future data reuse. We present a study, comprising interviews (n = 43) and ethnographic observation, of two university libraries who partnered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) collaboration to curate a significant astronomy data set. The two libraries made different choices of the materials to curate and associated services, which resulted in different reuse possibilities. Each of the libraries offered partial solutions to the SDSS leaders' objectives. The libraries' approaches to curation diverged due to contextual factors, notably the extant infrastructure at their disposal (including technical infrastructure, staff expertise, values and internal culture, and organizational structure). The Data Transfer Process case offers lessons in understanding how libraries choose curation paths and how these choices influence possibilities for data reuse. Outcomes may not match data producers' initial expectations but may create opportunities for reusing data in unexpected and beneficial ways. © 2020 Association for Information Science and Technology"

Pasquini,2020,Networked practices in higher education: A netnography of the #AcAdv chat community,"This study of the #acadv chat community details a longitudinal study about a digital learning network comprised of academic advising professionals who work in higher education. We discuss how networked communities of practice (CoP) scaffold professional learning and development of post-secondary educators, while also contributing to their daily practice. Utilizing Twitter chat transcripts, digital documents, social media platforms, and interviews with 17 participants of this community, we report 22 topics discussed with the top five themes focused on student needs, orientation support, advising approaches and structures, workload, and individual career development. Using a netnographic approach, we explore and offer insights about the origins, management, and sustainability of this networked practice over a seven-year period. Important findings center the organic, participatory nature of the community, the shared leadership structure, and the bidirectional nature of online and offline relationships as impacted in an online, occupational CoP. We suggest further research into networked practice to understand more about self-directed learning, participant motivation, digital archiving, and digital knowledge sharing in these types of networked occupational CoPs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc."
R. C. Knight; E. Rodrigues; R. Ciota,2020,Facilitating Collaborative Metadata Creation for Faculty-initiated Digital Projects,"The usability and long-term preservation of digital humanities projects, such as a digital archive or other project built around digitized materials, depend on thoughtful and thorough metadata creation. The variety of expertise required to create high-quality metadata for digital humanities projects practically requires a collaborative approach. Putting the call for collaboration into practice requires tools that are accessible and functional for all collaborators. Research on tools for metadata creation has tended to focus either on tools for librarians to manage digital project metadata or on tools for independent author metadata creation (Greenberg, 2003; Crystal & Greenberg, 2005). The literature has also tended to focus solely on the use of spreadsheets for metadata creation. Lincoln (2018) has discussed best practices for Google Sheets in archival metadata entry, and Broman and Woo (2017) have discussed best practices for spreadsheet data entry in general.

R. D. Frank,2020,The Social Construction of Risk in Digital Preservation,"Digital information is fragile, yet access to digital information over time is a critical underpinning of core values and functions in our society, from open government to research and scholarship. Digital preservation research has focused on identifying technical, economic, and organizational sources of risk and has relied on an assumption that individuals will behave in rational and predictable ways in response to the same information. This article asserts that viewing digital preservation as a process that takes place in complex social contexts is just as important as thinking about digital preservation in terms of technological or economic issues. This is particularly important for understanding how individuals involved in digital preservation construct their understanding of risk because social factors influence how people construct their understanding of, and behave in response to, risk information. The author proposes an eight-factor model for the social construction of risk, which includes: communication, complexity, expertise, organizations, political culture, trust, uncertainty, and vulnerability. The article demonstrates how these factors influence individuals as they construct their understanding of risk in the context of digital preservation and how this in turn affects digital preservation decisions. © 2019 ASIS&T"
R. Dekova,2020,The ontology of bulgarian dialects - Architecture and information retrieval,"Following a concise description of the structure, the paper focuses on the potential of the Ontology of the Bulgarian Dialects, which demonstrates a novel usage of the ontological modelling for the purposes of dialect digital archiving and information processing. The ontology incorporates information on the dialects of the Bulgarian language and includes data from 84 dialects, spoken not only on the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, but also abroad. It encodes both their geographical distribution and some of their main diagnostic features, such as the different mutations (also referred to as reflexes) of some of the Old Bulgarian vowels. The mutations modelled so far in the ontology include the reflex of the back nasal vowel /?/ under stress, the reflex of the back er vowel /?/ under stress, and the reflex of the yat vowel /?/ under stress when it precedes a syllable with a back vowel. Besides the opportunity for formal structuring of the considerable amount of data gathered through the years by dialectologists, the ontology also provides numerous possibilities for information retrieval - searches by dialect, country, dialect region, city or village, various combinations of diagnostic features. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC"

Information managers have at their disposal several alternatives beyond those that have achieved greater popularity in the area of academic repositories: DSpace and EPrints. Existing alternatives have evolved and implemented mayor improvements in their more recent versions, with the aim of adopting the latest standards for the semantic web and linked data. This paper provides a description of the new features incorporated into the latest versions of the most popular open-source products. The selection has been made using as a reference the information offered by the Digital Preservation Coalition (DPC), Digital Curation Center (DCC), National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA), and Open Preservation Foundation.

R. Gartner,2020,"Intermediary XML schemas: Constraint, templating and interoperability in complex environments","This article introduces the methodology of intermediary schemas for complex metadata environments. Metadata in instances conforming to these is not generally intended for dissemination but must usually be transformed by XSLT transformations to generate instances conforming to the referent schemas to which they mediate. The methodology is designed to enhance the interoperability of complex metadata within XML architectures. This methodology incorporates three subsidiary methods: these are project-specific schemas which represent constrained mediators to over-complex or over-flexible referents (Method 1), templates or conceptual maps from which instances may be generated (Method 2) and serialised maps of instances conforming to their referent schemas (Method 3). The three methods are detailed and their applications to current research in digital ecosystems, archival description and digital asset management and preservation are examined. A possible synthesis of the three is also proposed in order to enable the methodology to operate within a single schema, the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS).

R. Janković,2020,Algorithm comparison for cultural heritage image classification,"Digitization represents an important part of the development of online systems. As such it includes, among other, the deployment, categorization and preservation of audio, video and textual contents online. Such process is especially interesting from the perspective of cultural heritage, as it allows the long-term preservation and sharing of culture worldwide. This study observes four classification algorithms: (i) the multilayer perceptron, (ii) averaged one dependence estimators, (iii) forest by penalizing attributes, and (iv) the k-nearest neighbor rough sets and analogy based reasoning, before and after attribute classification, and compares these with the results obtained from the convolutional neural network. The obtained results show that the best classification performance was achieved by the multilayer perceptron, followed by the convolutional neural network. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

R. Pandey; V. Kumar,2020,Exploring the impediments to digitization and digital preservation of cultural heritage resources: A selective review,"This paper presents a careful review of studies underlining the impediments in digitization and digital preservation of cultural heritage resources faced by library professionals, archivists and project managers in digitization projects. A systematic and structured literature review based on the conceptual and empirical published studies on digitization and digital preservation is done to sieve out the barriers and challenges of digitization projects. The findings of the study revealed that most digitization projects suffer with impediments such as, inadequate funding, lack of national-level digital preservation policy and absence of technical infrastructure while digitizing and preserving the cultural and heritage resources. The originality of the paper lies in presenting the prominent constraints in digitization and preservation of cultural and heritage resources in consolidated manner otherwise scattered in several case studies. The findings will be of high significance for librarians and digitization project managers at the planning stage of their digitation projects. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020."

All of them have in common an explicit will of the protagonists to keep the records generated during the events, in order to build an account of what happened from below"" and to achieve recognition of their interests and rights. In this article, we analyze why each group of documents constitutes an archival fonds, the involvement of citizens in its configuration (capture, management, preservation, and dissemination of information), and the response of archival institutions for its preservation and custody. We confirm that citizens want to leave their documentary trace and use archives as a weapon of empowerment. We argue the need for greater involvement of trustworthy public archival institutions to safeguard, beyond the institutional memory, records created by citizens. The archives should make them accessible and should facilitate citizen participation. Their acquisition policies should be transparent and open to all of society."""
S. Cain; B. Welch; A. Oelschlager; D. VandeCreek,2020,Some assembly required: Low-cost digitization of materials from magnetic tape formats for preservation and access,"Recent work discussing the digitization and preservation of magnetic tape materials has maintained that it should be left to expert practitioners and that the resulting digital materials should be stored in digital repositories. This article suggests that librarians and archivists lacking extensive technical skills or access to expertise can digitize these materials themselves. It provides a detailed account, including challenges faced, of how a team of practitioners without prior training or experience digitized historical audio recordings on cassette and open reel tape at Northern Illinois University Libraries. The discussion reviews the assembly of equipment and software that the team used for digitization work, discussing each element's significance and how they came together as a functioning workflow. The authors also emphasize the fact that while the digitization of fragile and/or degraded magnetic tape materials may contribute to the preservation of their contents, this action also creates a new set of materials with their own preservation needs. Realizing that many practitioners serving medium-sized and smaller institutions lacking large financial resources may not have access to a full-fledged digital repository, they suggest the use of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance's Levels of Digital Preservation rubric as a means by which practitioners may incrementally increase the probability that digital materials made from magnetic tapes will remain accessible. © 2021 De Gruyter.

S. L. Farrell; L. G. Hendrickson; K. L. Mastel; J. A. Kelly,2020,"Historical scientific analog data: Life sciences faculty’s perspectives on management, reuse and preservation","Older data in paper or analog format (e.g., field/lab notebooks, photos, maps) held in labs, offices, and archives across research institutions are an often overlooked resource for potential reuse in new scientific studies. However, there are few mechanisms to help researchers find existing analog data in order to reuse it. Yet, in the literature, reuse of historical data is particularly important in studies of biodiversity and climate change. We surveyed life science researchers at the University of Minnesota to understand and explore current and potential future use of historical data, attitudes around sharing and reusing data, and preservation of the data. Large amounts of historical data existed on our campus. Most researchers had reused or shared it, and many continued to add to their data sets. Some data had been scanned, over half of researchers have re-keyed some of their data into machine-readable format, and nearly all that were converted to a digital format were stored on unstable platforms and legacy formats. Researchers also expressed concerns about long-term preservation plans, or who to contact for assistance in planning for the future of the data, since much of these data are at risk for loss. Currently produced digital data sets are subject to guidelines and requirements developed at a national level. Solutions for historical analog data could benefit from a similar high-level treatment, and it will take experts from various fields to lead this effort. Given libraries’ expertise in data management and preservation, librarians are in a position to collaborate on devising cross-disciplinary solutions. © 2020 The Author(s)."
S. Naron; G. M. Toth,2020,Let Them Speak: An Effort to Reconnect Communities of Survivors in a Digital Archive,"In 1979 the Holocaust Survivors Film Project began videotaping Holocaust survivors. Since then, its successor, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, has recorded and preserved testimonies for decades. Having completed a large-scale digitization of the entire collection, the archive has pivoted to increasing digital access. As part of its transition to a fully digital archive, it has developed a web-based digital anthology. This anthology, titled Let Them Speak, allows researchers to study circa 3000 interviews from three collections: Fortunoff Archive, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and USC Shoah Foundation. While digitization has helped alleviate one concern, long-term preservation, and opened new means of access, it raises several new challenges, technical, curatorial, and ethical. This chapter will elucidate some of these challenges. © 2020, The Author(s)."
S. S. Arslan; J. Peng; T. Goker,2020,A data-assisted reliability model for carrier-assisted cold data storage systems,"Cold data storage systems are used to allow long term digital preservation for institutions’ archive. The common functionality among cold and warm/hot data storage is that the data is stored on some physical medium for read-back at a later time. However in cold storage, write and read operations are not necessarily done in the same exact geographical location. Hence, a third party assistance is typically utilized to bring together the medium and the drive. On the other hand, the reliability modeling of such a decomposed system poses few challenges that do not necessarily exist in other warm/hot storage alternatives such as fault detection and absence of the carrier, all totaling up to the data unavailability issues. In this paper, we propose a generalized non-homogenous Markov model that encompasses the aging of the carriers in order to address the requirements of today's cold data storage systems in which the data is encoded and spread across multiple nodes for the long-term data retention. We have derived useful lower/upper bounds on the overall system availability. Furthermore, the collected field data is used to estimate parameters of a Weibull distribution to accurately predict the lifetime of the carriers in an example scale-out setting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
S. Shabani; M. Sokhn; H.

These platforms have enabled citizens to contribute to the process of digital preservation of cultural heritage by sharing documents and their knowledge. However, many historical datasets have problems due to incomplete metadata. To solve this issue, cultural heritage organizations heavily depend on domain experts. In this paper, we address the issue of completing the metadata of historical digital collections. For this, we introduce a new hybrid human-machine model. This model jointly integrates predictions of a deep multi-input model and inferred labels from multiple crowd judgements. The multi-input model uses visual features extracted from the images and textual features from the metadata, complemented with Wikipedia classes of concepts extracted in the text. On the crowd answer aggregation, our method considers the workers' reliability scores. This score is based on the performance of workers' task history and their performance in our task. We have applied our hybrid approach to a culture heritage platform and the evaluations show that it outperforms both deep learning and crowdsourcing when applied individually. © 2020 ACM."
S. Sharoff,2020,Know thy corpus! Robust methods for digital curation of Web corpora,"This paper proposes a novel framework for digital curation of Web corpora in order to provide robust estimation of their parameters, such as their composition and the lexicon. In recent years language models pre-trained on large corpora emerged as clear winners in numerous NLP tasks, but no proper analysis of the corpora which led to their success has been conducted. The paper presents a procedure for robust frequency estimation, which helps in establishing the core lexicon for a given corpus, as well as a procedure for estimating the corpus composition via unsupervised topic models and via supervised genre classification of Web pages. The results of the digital curation study applied to several Web-derived corpora demonstrate their considerable differences. First, this concerns different frequency bursts which impact the core lexicon obtained from each corpus. Second, this concerns the kinds of texts they contain. For example, OpenWebText contains considerably more topical news and political argumentation in comparison to ukWac or Wikipedia.

Digital data in support of cultural heritage management are addressed by the digital curation process, which has been emerging to account for the diversity of disciplinary communities and cultural heritage organizations. Digital curation addresses the diversity of participating skills and practices by working on the relationship between the cultural heritage objects and their digital counterparts. In particular, the innumerable initiatives for providing access to cultural heritage data are ideally coordinated by digital curation and are part of the process since the beginning. However, some thorough reflections on its role and implementation in cultural heritage institutions yet lack. In this paper, we provide a survey of the digital curation process, by unpacking the component curatorial tasks, with the solutions that have been proposed in the literature and in the application projects to account for the multiple perspectives at hand. © 2020 ACM."

The regulated use of the trust services (e.g. qualified electronic signature or seal etc.) as well as that of the secure electronic identities provides a solid foundation for the advancement of digitization. The adequate evidence of electronic records as long as they are needed is a critical success-factor for trustworthy digital transactions. The trustworthiness of the transactions must be based on compliance with the basic values of authenticity, integrity, reliability, availability, confidentiality and transferability. After a first hype there are increasingly more considerations also in regulated industries to use DLT for digital processes which have to be accountable. In order to make them evident and to fulfil documentation requirements it is necessary that DLT fulfils the legal framework and prior art based on defined criteria for trustworthy digital transactions. This paper focuses on the challenges and requirements for utilisation of DLT for trustworthy digital processes including long-term preservation. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

The survey research design was used, underpinned by a quantitative research method and guided by a conceptual framework. Online survey questionnaires were emailed to all twenty-seven academic libraries in South Africa. The findings show that academic libraries in South Africa are significantly affected by the changes in the digital environment. Most of these institutions are faced with many challenges as they attempt to preserve their digital content, including a lack of institutional commitment and involvement; absence of established digital preservation standards, policies and procedures; inadequate resources; lack of skills and training; lack of funding; limited collaboration efforts and partnerships; and technological obsolescence. This study recommends that these institutions can address many of their digital preservation challenges if they leverage these factors.

DRSI is maintained by the Polish scientific institutes, forming the DRSI Consortium. In 2018 a country-level, EU co-funded project named OZwRCIN, was initiated in order to improve DRSI. The project sets out several objectives that can be reduced to a general statement about sharing, archiving and disseminating public sector information. More than 140 thousands of digital objects will be provided in the scope of the project, using new technologies and innovative approaches. The project specifically aims at providing research datasets. To manage digitisation activities and make the digital content available online the DRSI uses infrastructure and tools developed by Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center (PSNC). PSNC is an ICT-focused R&D institution, infrastructure provider and operator of the Polish Optical Internet PIONIER. PSNC is a technical partner in the OZwRCIN project.

V. Bralić; H. Stančić; M. Stengård,2020,A blockchain approach to digital archiving: digital signature certification chain preservation,"Purpose: The short lifespan of digital signatures presents a challenge to the long-term preservation of digitally signed records. It can undermine attempts to presume, verify or assess their authenticity. This paper aims to investigate the challenges of the expiration of digital signatures in the context of digital archiving. Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies requirements for the long-term preservation of digitally signed records and compares them with the existing approaches. The characteristics, operational procedures and requirements of the technologies used for digital signatures are combined with the archival requirements to design a new model. Findings: The paper proposes a new model of a blockchain-based system, which can be combined with any digital archive to assist the process of long-term preservation of digitally signed records. Practical implications: The proposed model offers a new alternative to the current practice in the long-term preservation of digitally signed records, such as periodic resigning procedures or periodic wrapping of digitally signed records with archival timestamps. Originality/value: The proposed TrustChain 2.0 model is based on previous research conducted as part of the InterPARES Trust project. It builds on TrustChain 1.0 by including digital signature certificate chain validity information in a blockchain thus avoiding the issues concerning records confidentiality and privacy information disclosure. The paper contributes not only to the development of archival science but also shows archival institutions on how to approach long-term preservation of digitally signed records. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."
V. de Abreu e Silva; M. B. da Silva,2020,Metadata for the digital preservation of open data: An identification study,"Objective. Research that aims to identify useful metadata standards for the preservation and digital availability of open data according to current literature. Method. Is characterized as an exploratory research, in the identification of metadata and bibliographic standards, for the necessary literary foundation on descriptive representation of information, digital preservation and metadata, with the purpose of digitally treating, conserving and making available the open data, from the qualitative approach of data collection. Results. Based on literary research, results on the list of environments such as government websites, research institutes, digital repositories, electronic catalogs and digital libraries that adopt metadata standards that can be used to preserve and make available open data, specifically, Dublin Core, used in environments such as the Brazilian Open Data Portal; Preservation Metadata Implementation Strategies, present in repositories such as the Carolina Digital Repository; Metadata Object Description Schema, adopted by systems such as Copac: UK and Irish Research Library Catalog; and Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard, accessed to manage digital objects in libraries and repositories such as the National Digital Library of Portugal. Conclusions. Was concluded that the only metadata standard thought specifically of digital preservation, and that if considered as the recommended for the digital safeguard and availability of open data, is the Preservation Metadata Implementation, from fields like rights, agents and events, while that the other schemas identified, even if created for other purposes, also allow the preservation of data, such as the Dublin Core, in the use of the source, relation, coverage and rigths elements, of the Metadata Object Description Schema, when adopting the location and recordInfo attributes, and the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard, in adopting the structural link section and behavior section components. © 2020 University of Pittsburgh.

The goal of the paper is to state the importance of digital curation for the archaeological projects and to illustrate how it works in the case the Beyond Archaeology (BeArchaeo) project, an on-going European project, where all the interfaces that allow for the interactions with the digital objects will be based on a centralized database. Here we address all the phases that concern the archaeological activities, from the excavation to the exhibition of the findings, and we show how we develop the centralized data repository that undergoes the development of the communication interfaces. © Copyright 2020 for this paper by its authors.

Kelly,2020,Faculty perceptions of grey literature: A qualitative analysis of faculty interviews,"To examine the use, field perception, citation practices, creation, methods for finding, and dissemination of grey literature, this study used interviews of faculty at a large R1 university. Further, interviewees were asked specifically about one type of grey literature-preprints-as well as about ways in which libraries could support their overall grey literature goals. The study findings included concerns about the challenges of finding known items and the unstable nature of web pages. Some less expected findings included the use of grey literature in undergraduate instruction as well as faculty creation of grey literature for lay audiences. In terms of implications for practice, librarians could use these findings to inform long term preservation practices as well as access to institutional repositories. © 2020, GreyNet.

Y. Kang; Z. Liang,2020,"The digital preservation and presentation of red cultural heritages in Ganjiang River Basin, China","The Ganjiang River Basin of Jiangxi province with rich resources of red culture heritage is famous for the red tourism. The purpose of this study is to investigate how to balance the preservation and presentation during the tourism development in digital times. In recent developments related to cultural tourism, the villages and towns with lesser stocks of red cultural heritages are suffering from a lack of preservation and in danger of vanishing. Apart from the form of traditional museums responsible for cultural heritage preservation, the protected model of Ganjiang River watershed in digital is one of the few alternative paths. With the promotion of an entire digital city network during the watershed area, the gap between urban and rural areas has been widened in the preservation for red cultural heritage. For rural areas, the model of an open air museum is a good choice in digital times. Based on the basin's protection practice and tourist diversity demand, upgrading interpretation systems and improving digital experiences have become the trend for red cultural heritage presentations. Effective online communication is another way to display red culture. Two models of protection and presentation for red cultural heritage have been developed. © 2020 IEEE."

Y. T. Wang; S. Anastopoulou,2020,The development of popular music heritage: exploring an AR exhibition,"This paper explores the relationship between digital technologies and preservation of popular music heritage and focuses on the AR exhibition, David Bowie Is. Through the lens of discourse analysis, it discusses the interpretation of the popular music and its various digital narratives, the authenticity of user experiences, and how museum functions can be promoted by virtual exhibitions. It provides multiple narratives to tell Bowie’s untold stories and experiments on music, stage, and costumes that questioned gender and social norms. It creates authentic experiences for the audience through offering augmented information on exhibits that arouse the audience’s emotions and trigger their memories. The AR exhibition can also help to promote the museum’s functions due to access without boundaries, digital preservation and enhancing the museum’s educational role. The paper suggests that this AR exhibition offers new ways for museums to preserve popular music and different experiences of listening with potential commercial value. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Each aspect requires each data formats and processing techniques. In this paper, we discuss changes in the environment surrounding planetary explorations and the handling of big data on computers. As a result, for the long-term preservation of scientific data, there must be standards and a community to endorse the standards. After standards, each community prepares the analysis tools. Furthermore, scientists need to make efforts not only in standardization but also in ensuring the quality of science.

We approach this by exploring the digital legacy hard drives of the late artist Stephen Dwoskin (1939–2012), who is recognised as an influential filmmaker at the forefront of the shift from analogue to digital film production. The research findings of this case study show that digital forensics is effective in extracting a timeline of hard drive activities, data that can be explored to reveal clues about the artist's personal/professional history, stages of creative processes, and technical environment. The paper further demonstrates how this is related to current thinking around user-centred archival workflow and understanding of creative processes. The broader impact of the work for advancing digital archiving and research into creative processes is highlighted, concluding with a discussion of how, going forward, the approach can be coupled with deeper content analysis to reveal what influences editing choices taking place over time. © 2020"
Z. Dong; J. Wan; C. Li; H. Jiang; Y. Qian; W. Pan,2020,Feature Fusion based Cross-modal Retrieval for Traditional Chinese Painting,"Recently, large-scale digital preservation of traditional Chinese paintings has been launched. Effective retrieving them is still a significant challenge. There are two main reasons: (1) compared with modern images, their color contrast is not sharp enough, and the realism of objects is different. (2) the lack of labeled datasets. In order to address these problems, in this paper, we build a new labeled dataset and employ cross-modal retrieval for images of traditional Chinese painting. Our method utility data in two modals, text and image. We use the Bert model to extract the semantic text feature, and use CNN to extract the image feature. The two types of features are fused to realize cross-modal retrieval task. We evaluate our approach on three datasets. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our approach. © 2020 IEEE."
Z. Lischer-Katz,2020,Archiving experience: an exploration of the challenges of preserving virtual reality,"Purpose: This paper aims to explore the opportunities and challenges that immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies pose for archival theory and practice. Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper reviews research on VR adoption in information institutions and the preservation challenges of VR to identify ways in which VR has the potential to disrupt existing archival theory and practice. Findings: Existing archival approaches are found to be disrupted by the multi-layered structural characteristics of VR, the part–whole relationships between the technological elements of VR environments and the three-dimensional content they contain and the immersive, experiential nature of VR experiences. This paper argues that drawing on perspectives from phenomenology and digital materiality is helpful for addressing the preservation challenges of VR. Research limitations/implications: The findings extend conceptualizations of preservation by identifying gaps in existing preservation approaches to VR and stressing the importance of “experience” as a central element of archival practice and by emphasizing the embodied dimensions of interpreting archival records and the multiple scales of materiality that archival researchers and practitioners should consider to preserve VR. Practical implications: These findings provide guidance for digital curators and preservationists by outlining the current thinking on VR preservation and the impact of VR on digital preservation strategies. Originality/value: This paper gives new insight into VR as an emerging area of concern to digital curation and preservation and expands archival thinking with new conceptualizations that disrupt existing paradigms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The object of the research is the process of data exchange of archival information and the integration of information systems in the context of the transition to digital archiving. The urgency of the problem is substantiated, the formal statement of the problem is stated, and a survey analysis of the study of the problem is carried out. As a conceptual approach to solving the problem, the use of blockchain technologies is proposed, which allows us to significantly reduce the time of service for consumers of archived information. An information model of blockchain technologies in archiving has been developed. To implement a conceptual approach to solving the problem, an algorithm for organizing electronic exchange between objects is proposed. This algorithm provides for the control of ensuring the completeness and reliability of the archived information both on the part of the sender and on the part of the recipient of the archived information. © 2021 IEEE"
A. Acker,2021,"Emulation practices for software preservation in libraries, archives, and museums","Emulation practices are computational, technical processes that allow for one system to reproduce the functions and results of another. This article reports on findings from research following three small teams of information professionals as they implemented emulation practices into their digital preservation programs at a technology museum, a university research library, and a university research archive and technology lab. Results suggest that the distributed teams in this cohort of preservationists have developed different emulation practices for particular kinds of “emulation encounters” in supporting different types of access. I discuss the implications of these findings for digital preservation research and emulation initiatives providing access to software or software-dependent objects, showing how implications of these findings have significance for those developing software preservation workflows and building emulation capacities. These findings suggest that different emulation practices for preservation, research access, and exhibition undertaken in libraries, archives, and museums result in different forms of access to preserved software—accessing information and experiential access. In examining particular types of access, this research calls into question software emulation as a single, static preservation strategy for information institutions and challenges researchers to examine new forms of access and descriptive representation emerging from these digital preservation strategies. © 2021 The Author.

Challenges and successes materialized throughout the project relating to the PIRC's mission, service level, and collection dependencies. Continuing to meet users' demanding needs while learning and revising best practices was ambitious yet ultimately achievable. In addition to producing high-quality images for digital preservation, secondary positive outcomes of the project were the conservation of drawings, improvements to the reference process, and the ability to expand these services beyond the traditional user group.

A. Chikomba; A. Rodrigues; M. Ngoepe,2021,Management of digital records in selected financial services parastatals in Zimbabwe,"In recent years, there has been a surge of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the conduct of business. Public sector institutions in Zimbabwe have also embraced ICTs with an objective of promoting accountability, transparency and service delivery. This has increased the generation of digital records which are key in day-to-day business activities. However, the management of such records has been a challenge for most public sector institutions in most countries including Zimbabwe. Despite embracing ICTs, there have not been many changes to create a favourable environment for managing the resultant digital records. The findings reported in this research article were part of a broader study on the management of digital records in selected financial services parastatals in Zimbabwe. The study utilised the digital curation centre (DCC) curation lifecycle model as the theoretical framework of the study. This multiple case study research adopted a qualitative research approach to collect data from four purposively selected financial services parastatals in Zimbabwe using interviews, document analysis and observation as data collection tools. The study established that the financial services parastatals under investigation still lack requisite tools such as policies, guidelines and standards, adequate infrastructure and skilled manpower for effective and efficient management of digital records. In addition, the National Archives of Zimbabwe (NAZ), which has the legal mandate of regulating records management, has not been sufficiently involved in the management of digital records due to the lack of a legal and professional framework. Therefore, the study recommends the crafting of in-house policies and guidelines for managing digital records, procurement of adequate infrastructure and the recruitment of skilled and experienced manpower, if an enabling environment for the effective and efficient management of digital records is to be created. © The Author(s) 2020."

A. Kreiter,2021,The Hungarian Archaeology Database,"In Hungary, certain site documents, such as the Preliminary Archaeological Documentation (PAD), 30-day report and 1-year report, have to be submitted to centralised institutions. The content and format of these documents are regulated, facilitating their digital archiving and accessibility. However, further documents (inventories, databases, scientific assessments, interdisciplinary analysis, photos, drawings, etc.), mainly created by the museum that carried out the excavation, may not end up in the designated repositories. Instead, these documents are stored in the local museums that carried out the excavations and/or where the finds are kept. It is a major problem that there is no officially-appointed, centralised hard copy and/or digital repository in Hungary where all site documents are stored and made accessible. In this respect, there are millions of files stored in museums all over the country that are neither used nor reused and are not accessible, and without the archaeological community, or even central institutions, being aware of them. Another problem is that digital archiving of archaeological documents is not regulated either on a national or local level. The only repository that includes both metadata and documents in Hungary is the Archaeology Database of the National Museum. This database provides a solution for depositing digital documents, and it could serve as a national repository where documents can be stored and accessed online in one place (through access levels). However, submitting digital documents to the archaeology database is unregulated and it is completely voluntary. The archaeology database has the potential to assist archiving on a national level should it become compulsory to submit documents to it, as its structure was designed in accordance with the protocols and it hosts documents. © 2021 Council for British Archaeology.

A. Kulmukhametov; A. Rauber; C. Becker,2021,Improving data quality in large-scale repositories through conflict resolution,"Digital repositories rely on technical metadata to manage their objects. The output of characterization tools is aggregated and analyzed through content profiling. The accuracy and correctness of characterization tools vary; they frequently produce contradicting outputs, resulting in metadata conflicts. The resulting metadata conflicts limit scalable preservation risk assessment and repository management. This article presents and evaluates a rule-based approach to improving data quality in this scenario through expert-conducted conflict resolution. We characterize the data quality challenges and present a method for developing conflict resolution rules to improve data quality. We evaluate the method and the resulting data quality improvements in an experiment on a publicly available document collection. The results demonstrate that our approach enables the effective resolution of conflicts by producing rules that reduce the number of conflicts in the data set from 17 to 3%. This replicable method for presents a significant improvement in content profiling technology for digital repositories, since the enhanced data quality can improve risk assessment and preservation management in digital repository systems. © 2021, The Author(s)."

This necessitates usually expert knowledge of a librarian or curator in order to interpret the content and categorize it accordingly. This process is at the same time expensive and time-consuming. With the advent of knowledge bases and the plenitude of information contained within them new opportunities emerge at the horizon. In particular, entity-level analytics allows to semantically enrich contents via linked open data (LOD). To this end, we assess in this paper the approach of concise content annotation as a means of supporting the process of digital curation. In particular, we compare various entity-level annotation methods and highlight the importance of concise semantic tagging based on qualitative as well as quantitative evaluations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
A. Leventhal; J. Collins; T.

It does so in a stepwise manner, guiding the archivist or researcher through the process of preparing, opening, viewing, exploring, and understanding these files. While at first the technical aspects of born-digital design records, such as computer-Aided design (CAD) and building information modeling (BIM), can seem challenging, archivists should not be deterred. The article introduces crucial historical context and a methodology for unpacking the contents of born-digital design records, which together enable archivists to better see and decipher their significance and meaning. Also discussed are records creators, software preferences, processing workflows, and the visual interpretation of rendered images and the software interfaces. This then leads to a discussion around how to contextualize and understand the built form being communicated through drawings and models. The article also points to the array of teaching tools and interest groups that support archivists who wish to learn about the design community's practices, with the aim of lowering the barrier to engagement with these records. Visual literacy should be recognized as a vital skill, useful both in understanding these records and in decision-making around retention and preservation, so that stories of the places and people they reflect can be told. © 2021 Society of American Archivists.

A. Marquet,2021,A Maturity Model for Measuring Digital Transformation of Archives and Libraries,"The digital transformation is a process that has impact on several fields and thus has technological, economical, and also social dimensions. Even the speed of developments in different areas is varying. For libraries and archives the digital transformation is a major challenge as they are affected by the way they work and interact with their customers as well as digitized and born-digital artefacts are relatively new objects for long-term preservation.For years the library and the archives of social democracy (AdsD) of the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (FES) have been working in close cooperation but were divided into two separate departments. In 2018, it was decided to reunite the both of them. Against the background of this process, the maturity model of digital transformation was developed for both, libraries and archives as a comprehensive approach.Its dimension locates the digital transformation in the management area where it should be part of a superior strategy. The maturity model for digital transformation is an approach for its contextualization within this strategy and thus should be considered as one method among others. It is a tool in a tool box that gives insight into the libraries and the archives status to consolidate and prioritize next steps.As there are several fields that are affected by the digital transformation, the maturity model covers 4 dimensions: technologies, processes, organization, employees. It is designed as a self-assessment questionnaire with a six-step-range ordinal scale that identifies strengths and weaknesses. The result of this self-assessment enables to highlight the different levels of progression within and among these dimensions and lays the foundation for further conclusions."
A.

A. Oniszczuk; A. Makowska,2021,Belated Measures - the Reality of Digital Archaeological Archiving in Poland,"Archaeology in Poland, as in any other corner of the world, thrives on the application of digital technologies in fieldwork and subsequent analysis. Unfortunately, legal and administrative solutions have not been responsive enough to keep up with these changes. This article summarises the reality of archaeological digital archiving in Poland, shaped by a legally determined focus on paper documentation and the decentralisation of the state heritage service. The practice of digital archaeological archiving is illustrated by the results of a survey carried out among archaeologists from provincial heritage offices. It has revealed that, while they struggle with a lack of adequate technical measures and skills, they also opt for increasing the significance and proportion of digital archaeological archives and realise what should be done for this Digital Dark Age to end. On a more general level, the existence of digital documentation has already been recognised in laws on archiving and implementation of IT solutions. This article describes the actions taken at a national level to tackle these issues; namely, two state repositories: One for electronic documents and the other for digital resources of science and culture. It also presents current initiatives of the National Institute of Cultural Heritage in this regard. © 2021 Council for British Archaeology. All rights reserved."

A. Raugh; J. S. Hughes,2021,The Road to an Archival Data Format-Data Structures,"The current data formatting and labeling standards for the Planetary Data System (PDS) are known as the PDS4 Standards. They supersede the PDS3 Standards, but they represent a complete redesign of the requirements and implementation, rather than even a major incremental revision, from the previous standard. At the heart of the PDS4 Standards lies a fundamental, philosophical change from the PDS3 paradigm: the PDS4 Standards clearly and specifically constrain the way that the bytes comprising observational data may be stored in their data files-that is, the data structures-to a much greater degree than the PDS3 Standards ever did, even in their most mature realization. In PDS4, the PDS has defined data structures optimized for the long-term preservation of observational data. We explore the history of the PDS and its standards through the examination of a single, simple data structure (the 2D image), to understand the evolutionary pressures on the data and on the PDS that led to the development of the archival data structure requirements for observational data at the core of the PDS4 standards."

Aguirre,2021,Interactive Virtual Representation Of The Disappeared Convent Of El Carmen (Logroño) Generated From A Paper Craft Model,"The concept of mock-up, which share with the drawing the expressive synthesis for the analysis of the architectural form and evolution, is an invaluable asset for the preservation of the heritage. To mark the 175th anniversary of the Práxedes Mateo Sagasta’s secondary school of Logroño (Spain), an exhibition about the history of the institution was organized at the premises of La Rioja Library. The current school building became operational in 1900 and was built on the former site of a Carmelite convent. In fact, the convent rooms were the first location for the school, after the expropriations of religious communities during the mid-19th century. For the benefit of the aforementioned exhibition, it was considered interesting to generate a three-dimensional (3D) virtual reconstruction of the convent buildings to show how it would have looked. However, the lack of sufficient contemporary graphic information was a challenge, so it was decided that an efficient solution would be to generate the virtual reconstruction from a paper craft model, which had been created by the librarian of the secondary school as a result of his research on this matter. This text describes the 3D modelling of that cut-out element by means of monoscopic photogrammetry (perspective drawing) and the use of non-realistic rendering based on the appearance of the paper mock-up (and not trying to recreate the real image of the buildings) so as to provide a suggestive view of the convent and create interactive exhibition items. Moreover, the text deals with the long-term preservation and the improvement of the re-use of the 3D models. The former by resorting to institutional repositories —from which users can download the full detailed versions— and the latter employing versions able to be visualized in 3D warehouses (such as Sketchfab) and augmented reality (AR) applications. © 2015.

A. Sabharwal,2021,Functional frameworks for socialized digital curation: Curatorial interventions and curation spaces in archives and libraries,"Archives and libraries have expanded their curatorial capabilities with digital technologies and social media. Digital repositories, content management systems, and social media are part of a dual strategy for curating digital collections, combining the digital preservation of media and community participation in preserving community memory, cultural heritage, and thematic research collections. Socialized digital curation (SoDC) represents the convergence of digital and social curation approaches in a broader framework of relationships across the curation spaces (or functional frameworks) holding the pieces-curators, communities, collections, and technologies-together. Social purposing is evident as curators develop relationships with diverse communities. The cultural, generational, and professional diversity of archivist, librarian, and participant-curator (ALPC) communities further contributes to diversity in collection themes, choice of technologies, and knowledge organization preferences. The growth of digital content and collaborative activity on the Internet, however, has raised concerns about the discoverability of digital content in a fragmented Internet environment, necessitating three curatorial interventions-interlinking, knowledge organization, and documentation-to join disconnected and uninteroperable fragments. The conceptual framework presented in this study focuses on the interrelationships among curators, collections, technologies, and practices. There are no monolithic solutions to curatorial interventions and approaches to SoDC, as all archives and special collections are unique. © 2021 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois."

The read and write processes of DNA storage are error-prone. Images widely used in social media have the properties of fault tolerance which are well fitted to the DNA storage. However, prior work simply investigated the feasibility of DNA storage storing different types of data and simply store images in DNA storage, which did not fully investigate the fault-tolerant potential of images in the DNA storage. In this paper, we proposed a new image-based DNA system called IMG-DNA, which can efficiently store images in DNA storage with improved DNA storage robustness. First, a new DNA architecture is proposed to fit JPEG-based images and improve the image's robustness in DNA storage. Moreover, barriers inserted in DNA sequences efficiently prevent error propagation in images of DNA storage. The experimental results indicate that the proposed IMG-DNA achieves much higher fault-tolerant than prior work. © 2021 ACM."

Muthuganapathy,2021,‘CADSketchNet’ - An Annotated Sketch dataset for 3D CAD Model Retrieval with Deep Neural Networks,"Ongoing advancements in the fields of 3D modelling and digital archiving have led to an outburst in the amount of data stored digitally. Consequently, several retrieval systems have been developed depending on the type of data stored in these databases. However, unlike text data or images, performing a search for 3D models is non-trivial. Among 3D models, retrieving 3D Engineering/CAD models or mechanical components is even more challenging due to the presence of holes, volumetric features, presence of sharp edges etc., which make CAD a domain unto itself. The research work presented in this paper aims at developing a dataset suitable for building a retrieval system for 3D CAD models based on deep learning. 3D CAD models from the available CAD databases are collected, and a dataset of computer-generated sketch data, termed ‘CADSketchNet’, has been prepared. Additionally, hand-drawn sketches of the components are also added to CADSketchNet. Using the sketch images from this dataset, the paper also aims at evaluating the performance of various retrieval system or a search engine for 3D CAD models that accepts a sketch image as the input query. Many experimental models are constructed and tested on CADSketchNet. These experiments, along with the model architecture, choice of similarity metrics are reported along with the search results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
B. Štular,2021,Archiving of Archaeological Digital Datasets in Slovenia: Historic context and current practice,"This article presents the archiving of archaeological digital datasets in Slovenia in its historic context. The datasets discussed have been separated into three categories: non-reproducible datasets, reproducible datasets, and registries. Several reproducible datasets created by ZRC SAZU have been freely available online since the early 2000s, but the number of users is small and those benefiting often do not adhere to clearly stated copyright limitations. There is a large discrepancy between the stated interest and the actual usage of reproducible, let alone non-reproducible, online datasets disseminated as open access. In addition, adherence to fair use cannot be expected unless enforced. The key outcome of this study is that it has exposed a total absence of systemic archiving practice for non-reproducible digital datasets. The article concludes with recommendations and next steps that could be taken to address these issues in future. First and foremost, a systemic approach to digital archiving is urgently needed if the irreversible damage to the decades worth of born-digital non-reproducible digital data is to be averted. © 2021 Council for British Archaeology.

B. Tompkins; W. Ennaco; A. Kile; E. Sullivan,2021,"Collections Space: The Final Frontier (Smithsonian Institution, US)","To address storage challenges, the Smithsonian undertook a multi-year, highly collaborative, and Institution-wide planning initiative in 2010 to document, analyse, and plan for addressing current and projected collections space needs in a pragmatic, strategic and integrated manner. This case study provides an overview of the planning process, illustrates the innovative methodologies utilised in the initiative, and highlight outcomes which have made collections space an Institutional and budgetary priority—ensuring the long-term preservation and accessibility of Smithsonian collections. The immense scale of Smithsonian collections and collections spaces, the diversity of space types, and varied museum storage techniques constitute significant challenges for maintaining appropriate environments, security, fire safety, and storage equipment. The planning initiative established collaborative processes that engaged all stakeholders in solving collections space issues, conducted a comprehensive survey of existing Institutional conditions, and developed strategies applicable to other cultural institutions seeking efficient, sustainable collections space. The resulting Collections Space Framework Plan is a flexible roadmap to guide capital projects, provide renovation and new construction strategies that address unacceptable collections space conditions, allow for decompression of overcrowded collections, increase physical accessibility, anticipate future collections growth, and reduce reliance on lease space for collections storage. The Framework Plan has transformed the future of Smithsonian collections space. Existing conditions are documented in a database which is updated annually and analysed to prioritise improvements. It has already had a major impact on programming and securing funding for critical space improvements at Smithsonian museums and two off-site collections centres. © 2021 International Council of Museums (ICOM)."
C. Alec; J. L. Manguin; M. Spaniol,2021,FETD2 : A Framework for Enabling Textual Data Denoising via Robust Contextual Embeddings,"Efforts by national libraries, institutions, and (inter-) national projects have led to an increased effort in preserving textual contents - including non-digitally born data - for future generations. These activities have resulted in novel initiatives in preserving the cultural heritage by digitization. However, a systematic approach toward Textual Data Denoising (TD2 ) is still in its infancy and commonly limited to a primarily dominant language (mostly English). However, digital preservation requires a universal approach. To this end, we introduce a “Framework for Enabling Textual Data Denoising via robust contextual embeddings” (FETD2 ). FETD2 improves data quality by training language-specific data denoising models based on a small number of language-specific training data. Our approach employs a bi-directional language modeling in order to produce noise-resilient deep contextualized embeddings. In experiments we show the superiority compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The InterMusE project aims to support this shared instinct to archive by capturing and, crucially, linking different forms of data regarding the musical events provided by three of these local concert-giving organisations, beginning with the digitisation of their collections and with a view to producing a dynamic, open-access digital archive. This paper outlines our approach to establishing a foundation for developing a new kind of digital archive for musicology that is both valuable for researchers, fulfils the needs of the societies and their communities, and sheds light on community music-making on a national and, ultimately, international scale. By carrying out a series of preliminary scoping exercises, including informal interviews and archival-collection assessments, we can compare current archiving and preservation activities across the societies. These conversations bring emerging themes, issues and challenges into focus, raising pertinent questions that will inform our development of transformative tools and techniques for community digitisation projects. © 2021 ACM."

Popescu,2021,"Component materials, 3D digital restoration, and documentation of the imperial gates from the wooden church of Voivodeni, Sălaj County, Romania","The wooden churches from Transylvania, Romania, are a unique and representative cultural heritage asset for rural communities, both in terms of architecture and the style of painting that defines them as monuments of national heritage. These churches are in danger of degradation because rural communities are beginning to abandon them for various motives (e.g., they are too small, are expensive to maintain, or are being replaced by modern churches, built of stone and modern materials). The reason behind their accelerated degradation is that they are covered with shingles that need to be periodically changed and repaired to prevent water from reaching the inner painting layer, a process that is, in many cases, ignored. Imperial gates are the symbol of these churches and separate the nave from the narthex. They are made entirely out of wood and were sculpted and painted manually by skilled craftsmen and still represent the central element of these churches, in terms of art and aesthetics. The digital preservation of these heritage assets is an interdisciplinary undertaking, which begins with the physico-chemical analysis of the pigments in the painting layer, continues with three-dimensional (3D) digitization of the monument and of the objects of interest (such as the imperial gates), and finishes with a digital restoration of these monuments and artefacts. This paper presents a working methodology, successfully applied in digitizing and digitally restoring imperial gates from wooden churches in Transylvania, namely from the wooden church of Voivodeni, Sălaj County, Romania (Transylvania region). X-ray fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy were used to determine the pigments in the painting layer of these artefacts, and after they were identified, they were synthesized in laboratory conditions. The resulting color was digitized and used for digitally restoring the artefact(s) to its (their) pristine condition. To popularize these cultural heritage assets, the authors make use of virtual reality to mediate the interaction between the general public and heritage objects in their current state of preservation, in a digital environment. Moreover, to showcase how these heritage objects were degraded over time, a digitally restored version of the artefact in pristine condition is presented alongside a version in its current state (as is, digitized, but not yet digitally restored). © 2021 by the authors.

C. Ponsard,2021,Meeting digital preservation requirements for software through an emulation strategy,"Digital preservation aims at ensuring digital artefacts remain accessible and usable. This includes preserving application software for the resulting experience but also software required to provide access to valuable digital artefacts. This paper surveys different preservation strategies of such software with a focus on the use of emulation which is gaining momentum over the more traditional migration approach. We highlight some requirements to consider when selecting emulators. We illustrate the process on the preservation of software on a micro-computers of the 1980’s. We also discuss how to design software architectures for the long term preservation of the emulators themselves. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

C. Post; A. Chassanoff,2021,Beyond the workflow: archivists’ aspirations for digital curation practices,"The documentation of archival workflows plays an important role in digital curation practice. Capturing the various steps, tools, people, and software involved at different stages, workflow documentation visually represents complex activities, and at times, invisible labor. In this article, we reflect on findings from the OSSArcFlow project, a three-year, grant-funded initiative to investigate and document workflow activities of 12 cultural heritage institutions using three open-source software systems. Building on previously published research on documentation of current digital curation practices, this article reflects on the challenges the project team encountered in modeling archivists’ aspirations for their workflows. While current practices could be accurately represented in linear process models, archivists’ aspirations for how they might advance digital curation practices extended beyond adding or changing discrete workflow steps and often involved sociotechnical factors that could not be easily mapped. This article presents a taxonomy of archivists’ aspirations for their born-digital archives, grouping these goals together around major themes that emerged throughout the research. Our findings show that workflow documentation is an essential artifact in helping archivists to understand gaps and challenges in their current workflows and to imagine the further development of digital curation tools, systems, and practices. Project participants especially benefited from engaging in this reflection on workflow documentation as part of a community of practitioners, with the opportunity to compare across institutional contexts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
C. Tsang,2021,Red Sky at Night: Digital archiving in England 2020,"Across Europe, countries are at different stages of dealing with digital archaeological archives and how those archives are dealt with is affected by differences in statutory requirements, legal ownership of archives and infrastructure. In England, there is no single national repository for archaeological archives and there is no legal requirement to deposit either physical or digital archives with public bodies, and deposition rates for digital remain low. The archaeological sector remains aware of the implications of producing ever-growing quantities of born-digital data, which interested parties are attempting to address. The current framework and situation regarding digital archiving in England, therefore, offers an interesting case study for how digital archiving is dealt with through the application of professional standards, rather than legislative requirements. This article aims to summarise the current situation regarding digital archaeological archives in England. Across the UK there has been a great deal of work and focus on archaeological archives, driven by two main factors: Archaeological archives are curated by a network of regional and local museums and currently resources are shrinking in terms of storage capacity and archaeological curators. Repositories for physical archives can therefore be ill-prepared for the curation of digital archaeological archives, which can risk loss of archaeological digital data, and in 2017 this was recognised within the UK government's Mendoza Review (Mendoza 2017). This article describes the current work to resolve these issues - including strengthening the planning process, providing standards and guidance for data creators and repositories. © 2021 Council for British Archaeology.

Unnithan,2021,"Blockchains and provenance: How a technical system for tracing origins, ownership and authenticity can transform social trust","Provenance and trust can be seen as closely related concepts. This chapter explores the use of blockchain technology to trace provenance, taking as a framework the taxonomy of trust"" derived from the discipline of archival science. After considering the taxonomy's three major requirements for trustworthy records-accuracy, reliability, and authenticity-the authors argue that tracing and documenting the provenance of data and records are at the nexus of how blockchains can be used to transform social trust, and that blockchain offers the potential to authenticate digital records. But if the provenance of digital objects is to be authenticated and trusted over time, blockchain systems must be designed with a view to the long-term preservation of the provenance information that such systems convey. The chapter concludes with a review of two ""real world"" use cases: the tracing of health data provenance using blockchain, and the authentication of assets in the world of banking and finance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

D. F. García-Molina; R. González-Merino; J. Rodero-Pérez; B. Carrasco-Hurtado,2021,3D DOCUMENTATION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF HISTORICAL HERITAGE: THE CASTLE OF PRIEGO DE CÓRDOBA (SPAIN),"One of the main objectives of heritage management policies is to promote measures aimed at the maintenance, restoration and enhancement of cultural and archaeological assets. To guarantee this, the responsible institutions must promote actions for the dissemination and transference of cultural heritage, as well as promoting actions with the greatest possible rigour, developing scientific and technical studies that support and improve intervention methods. Recent technological advances in fields such as photogrammetry, digital terrestrial scanning and 3D modelling have made a significant contribution to the digital preservation and dissemination of architectural heritage. European administrations, in their desire of regional development, as well as the central or local governments have notably boosted the recovery of their rich and diverse heritage. A particular case is Priego de Cordoba’s Castle, a stronghold which was one of the most important monumental icons of the Andalusian period. Currently, this site is the main target of many architectural interventions and a model due to the implementation of last generation techniques in digital preservation. The local archaeological department promotes a large number of interventions and archaeological excavations. This has made a priority to get a qualitative geometrical 3D documentation, and therefore a constantly updated the point cloud (xyzRGB).This paper is focussed on presenting the results of the digital preservation process through 2D planimetry obtained from photogrammetric technics, 3D models, and geospatial data. These techniques are a previous step to large architectonical intervention planned in Priego de Cordoba’s Castle, in particular, the identified structures as Wall 1 and Tower 1. Two out of the three studied structures can be found in Wall 1. They correspond to a cobblestone pavement located in the rampart of the Wall 1, which is a post-medieval period; a double-stepped semi-underground path, excavated in the infill of the wall. The third structure studied in this paper consists of a well, which drills vertically the infill of the wall of the Tower 1. This feature is interpreted in the last research as a vertical well to place the weights of the clock sited in this tower until the 19th century. This work combines two techniques of geometric documentation to obtain a more complete point cloud. The terrestrial laser scanning, and the photogrammetry due to the higher colour performance, along with the completion of the point cloud obtained with the laser scanner. Along with this study, we will analyse the features which will better define the best technique to fit the documentation of the different structures. Their geometric characteristics, the incidence of sunlight or the accessibility will condition the use and choice of the technique. We have stated that there is software nowadays which makes it easier to access and consult the information through new computing hardware. Besides, we have highlighted the importance of knowledge and synergy from the different stakeholders implied (city council, technological centre and private companies). The final goal consists of making the society aware of the capital importance of digital preservation as well as dissemination of science. © 2015. UPV, SEAV. All rights reserved."
D. Novák; M. Kuna; O. Lecbychová,2021,Taming the Beast. Approaches to Digital Archiving in Czech Archaeology,"As in other countries, Czech archaeology has embarked on a journey of digitisation. This creates the need to cope with the rapid growth of digital data, which must be stored securely over the long term and be accessible in a comprehensible and useful way. This causes several problems. Although there is a centralised and well-resourced digital agenda that meets the requirements of the Heritage Law, outdated legislation and the absence of comprehensive rules do nothing to regulate the management of the most valuable data - the primary documentation of fieldwork events. At present, only summary information on archaeological fieldwork and the final reports, which should contain a substantial selection of documentation, are centrally collected and stored. This is a situation that is difficult to accept as primary (raw) data with a greater information value is disappearing into thin air. The premise for change lies in supplying the existing central infrastructure - The Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) - with the tools to acquire and archive primary data on a larger scale, while at the same time, amending the legal obligations imposed on archaeological practitioners. Sustainable change requires a significant overhaul of the current concept, objectives and especially the practice of archaeological fieldwork projects, particularly in the planning and post-excavation phases. © 2021 Council for British Archaeology.

D. Ocón,2021,Digitalising endangered cultural heritage in Southeast Asian cities: preserving or replacing?,"In the last decade, the dramatic developments in digitalisation have reached cultural heritage. Digital archiving and reconstruction, virtual reality, and 3D laser scanning, modelling and printing, are influencing the way we consume, manage, and preserve it. As part of the latter, detailed virtual records of endangered urban cultural heritage, through digital archiving, capturing, and reconstruction techniques, can help preserve its memories and lengthen its life; particularly, once decision-makers resolve to end its tangibility. However, the application of digitalisation to cultural heritage is not always easy, faced with issues such as cost, lack of sources and skills, sustainability, and intellectual property limitations. This paper illustrates the challenges encountered by land-deprived and fast-growing Southeast Asian cities in amalgamating urban cultural heritage preservation with pressing development needs. Ultimately, it discusses the introduction of digitalisation in this debate by examining the broader consequences of the association. ©, David Ocón."

We support this claim by using an enriched ontology to address a well known, challenging problem: record linkage of historical records for intergenerational family reconstitution. An enriched ontology enables extraction of birth, death, and marriage records via linguistic grounding, curation of record-comprising information with pragmatic constraints and cultural normatives, and record linkage by evidential reasoning. The result is an automatic and highly accurate reconstruction of family trees. Empirical evidence shows that conceptual modeling theory can be applied to important real-world problems and yield excellent results. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

J. Brown [1], have been digitized and made publicly available, along with supporting software scripts that facilitates usage of the data. The isotherms include laboratory measurements of xenon, krypton, and carbon dioxide adsorption (and, when possible, desorption) isotherms on a single sample of Vycor glass1, at various temperatures including subcritical conditions for xenon and krypton. The highlight of this dataset is the collection of “scanning” isotherms for xenon on Vycor at 131 K. The scanning isotherms examine numerous trajectories through the adsorption-desorption hysteresis region, such as primary adsorption and desorption scanning isotherms that terminate at the hysteresis boundary, secondary scanning isotherms made by selective reversals that return to the boundary, and closed scanning loops. This dataset was originally used to test the independent domain theory of adsorption and continues to support successor theories of adsorption/desorption scanning hysteresis including more recent theories based on percolation models. Through digital preservation and release of the tables from Brown's dissertation, these data are now more easily accessible and can continue to find use in developing models of adsorption for fundamental and practical applications. © 2021 National Institute of Standards and Technology.

They were recorded using a form, photographs, and drawings. Samples were taken for radiocarbon dating, and dates range from 253BP±20 to 105 ± 20 BP. The analysis of nautical features allows for possible identifications of origin, one canoe being local, and the other three assigned to a regional context. No conservation procedure has been applied to any of them to prevent wood decay. Photographic recording was used in two cases to produce preliminary 3D models for digital preservation.

F. Kräutli; M. Valleriani,2021,Linked data strategies for conserving digital research outputs: The shelf life of digital humanities,"Digital research outputs in the form of websites, databases and interactive visualisation tools pose a challenge for long-term maintenance and reusability. A central problem for libraries and research institutions working in the digital humanities is that digital projects require constant maintenance: they are not static artefacts that can be preserved but living software environments that must be maintained. In this chapter, we argue in favour of creating semantically rich research data that can be separated from the software used to create and view it. We outline how we put this approach into practice, both within the scope of an individual research project and at scale, as libraries take on new responsibilities in managing digital research outputs. We hope to offer insights into the kind of artefacts that can be preserved in principle and the technical solutions with which reusability of research data can be achieved in order to make long-term preservation of digital research outputs feasible. © 2022 Koraljka Golub and Ying-Hsang Liu."

G. K. Thekkum Kara,2021,Developing a sustainable cultural heritage information system,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the need for developing an Indian cultural heritage information system (CHIS) where the cultural heritages can efficiently document, manage and preserve and integrate with a searchable user interface mechanism. Further, the study scopes out the feasibility of developing single-window comprehensive national CHIS for all the cultural heritage properties of India enlisted in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO’s) World Heritage list. Design/methodology/approach: Conservation efforts and their sustenance require the support of a knowledge base cum digital archiving and information retrieval tool. The present study identifies the basic requirements, strategies and the execution of designing a reliable information system for cultural heritage inheritances to safeguard them to facilitate access to the current and future resilient communities. Approach on issues and challenges associated while developing such an information system has also been addressed with possible recommendations. Findings: In India, even though regional level conservation efforts are occurring, no comprehensive information system, which gives the whole perspective of the item or environment of heritage site, has been developed for the heritage sites recognized by UNESCO in its World Heritage list from India. Developing such a comprehensive digital archive for cultural heritage helps to showcase its assets and ensures its visibility globally without hampering the physical form. Application Information and Communication Technology and digital technologies can extensively be used coupled with mechanisms such as mobile devices, digital systems and content visualization techniques to support the efficient and effective management in a systemized way. Research limitations/implications: As a pilot study, this paper examined the cultural heritage properties incorporated in the UNESCO World list. There are many lesser-known and unprotected cultural heritages in different parts of the country having artistic value and the unique characteristics, and the possibility of building the similar kind of information system for them with innovative technological solutions are not covered under this study. Practical implications: Access to such an exclusive digital archive in a single-window platform would greatly support administrators, tourist departments, culture departments, development administration and conservation activists. The digital version of cultural inheritances created under the cultural heritage of India must have relevance to different subject fields such as history, archeology, manuscript logy, art, administration, knowledge management, computer science and library science. Also, it ensures that the resources remain accessible to the public without any restrictions provided with a comprehensive recapitulation. Originality/value: To the authors’ best knowledge, no such comprehensive system envisages or is practiced in the country. Developing such a system with technological and data infrastructure also helps to understand the value, support the activities related to cultural heritage and bring the local community to support and initiate such heritage conservation activities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
H. Brown,2021,Interconnected Disaster Management - Bridging the Physical and Digital Divide,"When a disaster strikes, major damage can occur to physical and digital collections. However a major research project, undertaken in the context of Australian national state and territory (NSLA) libraries, has uncovered that the approaches to the disaster management of physical and digital collections are largely divided and uncoordinated. The outcomes of the research project have demonstrated the benefits and feasibility of integrating disaster management across all collection formats–physical and digital, while also noting barriers and areas of disconnect. A practical application of the research has been the updating of the ALIA disaster management resources, as a ‘one stop shop’ integrated approach to managing disasters across all collection formats. Overall, at a time of elevated risk of disasters due to climate change, this research provides an important contribution to the field of disaster management with an integrated perspective that has potential application across the wider GLAM sector within Australia, and internationally, with organisations such as Blue Shield International. © 2021 Heather Brown."
H. Shi; D. Xu; H. Zhang; Y. Y. Yue,2021,A single historical painting super-resolution via a reference-based zero-shot network,"As an important part of human cultural heritage, many ancient paintings have suffered from various deteriorations that have led to texture blurring, color fading, etc. Single image super-resolution (SISR) which aims to recover a high-resolution (HR) version from a low-resolution (LR) input is actively engaged in the digital preservation of cultural relics. Currently, only traditional superresolution is widely studied and used in cultural heritage, and it is difficult to apply learning-based SISR to unique historical paintings because of the absence of both ground truth and datasets. Fortunately, the recently proposed ZSSR method suggests that it is feasible to generate a small dataset and extract self-supervised information from a single image. However, when applied to the preservations of historical paintings, the performance of ZSSR is highly limited due to the lack of image knowledge. To address the above issues and to unleash the great potential of learning-based methods in heritage conservation, we present Ref-ZSSR, which is the first attempt to combine zero-shot and reference-based methods to achieve SISR. In our model, both global and local multi-scale similar information is fully exploited from the painting itself. In an end-to-end manner, this information provides consistent artistic style image knowledge and helps synthesize SR images with sharp texture details. Compared with the ZSSR method, our approach shows improvement in both precision (approximately 4.68 dB for scale ×2) and visual perception. It is worth mentioning that all image knowledge required in our method can be extracted from the painting itself, i.e., external examples are not required. Therefore, this approach can be easily generalized to any damaged historical paintings, broken murals, noisy old photos, incomplete art works, etc. © 2021 The Authors.

H. Stančić; V. Bralić,2021,Digital archives relying on blockchain: Overcoming the limitations of data immutability,"Archives, both analogue and digital, are primarily concerned with preserving records as originals. Because of this, immutable data as used in a blockchain data structure seem a logical choice when designing such systems. At the same time, archives maintain records which may need to change over the long term. It is a requirement of archival preservation to be able to update records’ metadata in order not only to guarantee authenticity after digital preservation actions but also to ensure that relationships to other records, which might be created after an original record has entered the archive (and has been registered in a blockchain), can be maintained. The need to maintain an archival bond, which represents a network of relationships between aggregation of records, i.e., the relationship connecting previous and subsequent records belonging to the same activity, is a prime example of this requirement. This paper explores realisation of the archival bond in the context of blockchain-based archival system by proposing a supporting database system which enables metadata to be changed as required but also significantly simplifies searching compared to searching on-chain information, while keeping the immutability characteristic of blockchain. © 2021 by the authors."
H. Thwaites,2021,Heritage preservation in the post-digital era: How much information is enough?,"Digital media have revolutionized the practice of scholarship from archives to the creation of content. Continuing into the next decades, the application of digital technologies will remain a pivotal component to cultural heritage research-crea-tion projects. Heritage preservation by means of virtual heritage or digital heritage broadly refers to the use and application of computational tools and methods to humanist fields of study. It embraces a transdisciplinary approach to inspire new research initiatives, while at the same time employing digital media technologies for content creation and sharing across the public space. This article provides an overview of the information design process applied to the digital preservation and re-presentation of cultural heritage. It employs principles of digital heritage to create a matrix of cultural heritage content within the themes of legacy, transmis-sion and transformation. The intangible nature of world heritage is of increasing concern. How that can be preserved and how it becomes sampled and preserved in digital archives for the future are key questions, originating from the inquiry – How much information is enough? This article endeavours to illuminate that question though an exemplar research-creation project, showcasing the materiality of the digital, its embodiment, agency and the resulting impact on the audiences it seeks to inform. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

'The Longitudinal IntermediaPlus (2014-2016)' big data dataset is uniquely rich: it covers an array of German online media extendable to cross-media channels and user information. The metadata file for this dataset, and its documentation, were recently deposited as its own MySQL database called charmstana-sample-14-16.sql (https://data.gesis.org/sharing/#!Detail/10.7802/2030) (cs16) and is suitable for generating descriptive statistics. Analogous to the 'Data View' in spss, the charmstana-analysis (ca) contains the dataset's numerical values. Both the cs16 and ca MySQL files are needed to conduct analysis on the full database. The research challenge was to process large-scaled datasets into one longitudinal, big-data data source suitable for academic research, and according to fair principles.

Arthurs,2021,Human fetal whole-body postmortem microfocus computed tomographic imaging,"This protocol describes how to prepare and image human fetuses using microfocus computed tomography, a less invasive imaging alternative to conventional autopsy.Perinatal autopsy is the standard method for investigating fetal death; however, it requires dissection of the fetus. Human fetal microfocus computed tomography (micro-CT) provides a generally more acceptable and less invasive imaging alternative for bereaved parents to determine the cause of early pregnancy loss compared with conventional autopsy techniques. In this protocol, we describe the four main stages required to image fetuses using micro-CT. Preparation of the fetus includes staining with the contrast agent potassium triiodide and takes 3-19 d, depending on the size of the fetus and the time taken to obtain consent for the procedure. Setup for imaging requires appropriate positioning of the fetus and takes 1 h. The actual imaging takes, on average, 2 h 40 min and involves initial test scans followed by high-definition diagnostic scans. Postimaging, 3 d are required to postprocess the fetus, including removal of the stain, and also to undertake artifact recognition and data transfer. This procedure produces high-resolution isotropic datasets, allowing for radio-pathological interpretations to be made and long-term digital archiving for re-review and data sharing, where required. The protocol can be undertaken following appropriate training, which includes both the use of micro-CT techniques and handling of postmortem tissue."
I. Deserno; N. Roche; B. Viallet; E. Wintenberger,2021,Archives and the Atlantic Pact: how the NATO Archives preserves and protects the records of an Alliance,"In 2019, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) celebrated 70 years of consultation, consensus and conflict prevention. The same year also marked 20 years since NATO first opened access to its archives to the public. The establishment of the NATO Archives in 1999 was hailed by then Secretary General Javier Solana as an important signal of the Alliance’s commitment to transparency and openness. NATO declassified and publicly disclosed thousands of documents and opened a dedicated Reading Room at NATO Headquarters in Brussels. Behind the scenes, the establishment of the NATO Archives and of the Archives Committee also changed the way in which NATO managed its historical records. Up to this point, there was no NATO-wide policy on archives, no organizational archives and no consistency in any of the traditional archival functions. Starting in 1999, NATO could boast a professional archives programme, implemented by trained archivists and governed by a committee of national experts. The programme can claim a string of successes over the last 20 years, implementing archival strategy in novel and unique ways to respond to NATO’s organizational structure. While the Archives are part of NATO’s political headquarters, NATO itself is composed of multiple formal entities under the overall direction of the North Atlantic Council and the Military Committee, including military commands, civilian agencies, military operations etc. Before 1999, each managed their archival material locally, according to internal procedures. This article outlines the Archives’ strategic policies and its governance, involving national experts of all its 30 member nations; presents its increasingly larger and more robust acquisition programme based on a strong and actively managed retention and disposition strategy; assesses its digital preservation activities; and provides an update on NATO’s declassification and public disclosure programme. © 2021 Liverpool University Press.

It highlights the initiatives taken at the Central Library of Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, to digitize and preserve the GL. It dwells upon how 18,000 theses and dissertations were digitized, and 7500 documents related to people’s movements in the pre and post-independence era comprising 3lac pages were digitized and archived. It elaborates on the challenges encountered and overcome, like removing the duplicate copies, assigning metadata, and saving files as PDF/A, budgetary constraints. The study has relevance for other libraries that intend to undertake digitization projects. The paper also describes the Digital Thesis Tracking System which facilitates the research scholars to submit their theses online for evaluation and award of the degree. JNU implemented this online system a few years ago and has reaped rich dividends mostly during this crucial time when the university is closed. It is beneficial for the professionals to implement a system like Digital Thesis Tracking System, facilitating the user community to submit their theses online. The authors recommend implementing such a digital system where the research community can upload their theses, plagiarism report, and other necessary documents. Further, the same can be forwarded to the examiners with ease, and action could be taken.

I. Nishanbaev; E. Champion; D. A. McMeekin,2021,A web GIS-based integration of 3D digital models with linked open data for cultural heritage exploration,"In recent years, considerable efforts have been made by cultural heritage institutions across the globe to digitise cultural heritage sites, artifacts, historical maps, etc. for digital preservation and online representation. On the other hand, ample research projects and studies have been published that demonstrate the great capabilities of web-geographic information systems (web-GIS) for the dissemination and online representation of cultural heritage data. However, cultural heritage data and the associated metadata produced by many cultural heritage institutions are hetero-geneous. To make this heterogeneous data more interoperable and structured, an ever-growing number of cultural heritage institutions are adopting linked data principles. Although the cultural heritage domain has already started implementing linked open data concepts to the cultural heritage data, there are not many research articles that present an easy-to-implement, free, and open-source-based web-GIS architecture that integrates 3D digital cultural heritage models with cloud computing and linked open data. Furthermore, the integration of web-GIS technologies with 3D web-based visualisation and linked open data may offer new dimensions of interaction and exploration of digital cultural heritage. To demonstrate the high potential of integration of these technol-ogies, this study presents a novel cloud architecture that attempts to enhance digital cultural heritage exploration by integrating 3D digital cultural heritage models with linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms using web-GIS technologies. More specifically, a digital interactive map, 3D digital cultural heritage models, and linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms were integrated into a cloud-based web-GIS architecture. Thus, the users of the architecture can easily interact with the digital map, visualise 3D digital cultural heritage models, and ex-plore linked open data from GeoNames and DBpedia platforms, which offer additional information and context related to the selected cultural heritage site as well as external web resources. The architecture was validated by applying it to specific case studies of Australian cultural heritage and seeking expert feedback on the system, its benefits, and scope for improvement in the near future. © 2021 by the authors.

J. E. Friday; M. E. Eze,2021,Digital Preservation of Electronic Theses and Dissertations in Public University Libraries in South-East Nigeria,"The study examined digital preservation of electronic theses and dissertations in public university libraries in South-East Nigeria. The study adopted descriptive survey research design. The study population comprised 256 librarians out of which only 68 digital or institutional repository librarians were covered. A self-constructed questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analysed using mean and standard deviation. It was found that information migration was the most common strategy adopted for preserving e-theses and dissertations in the university libraries. It was also discovered that the libraries mostly used DSpace for preserving e-theses and dissertations. Moreso, their most common policies for preserving e-theses and dissertations relate to ensuring long-term accessibility, maintenance of continued authenticity and integrity of items, allocating responsibility to skilled and administrative staff, allowing open access and permitting items to be deposited by author for self-archiving. The research also identified lack of adequate funding, adequate ICT facilities, skilled staff, poor power supply, lack of staff development programmes and policy as the top challenges facing the libraries in preserving e-theses and dissertations. The study recommended that government should provide adequate funding to public universities, universities management should conduct personnel development programmes for librarians and improve power supply. © 2021.

In Brazil, although there is a robust set of laws that determine the State to manage, access and preserve its documents and information, there is still no policy for the preservation of web content. The result is the erasure and permanent loss of government information produced exclusively through websites. It is noticed that there are several government initiatives for web archiving around the world, which can be used as examples for the implementation of a Brazilian policy. It is concluded that the long-term maintenance of governmental information available on the web is fundamental for public debate and for monitoring governmental actions. To ensure the preservation of this content, the country must define its policy for the preservation of documents produced in a web environment. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."
J.

In this paper I will explore how the emphasis of that research has changed over time, from the early extensive surveys and assessments of archaeology in the main lowland wetland areas of England, through to detailed understanding of particular places under threat and processes that pose risk to the long-term preservation of archaeological and paleoenvironmental remains in wetlands. Such processes encompass environmental risks, including climate change, and those created - intentionally or otherwise - by changing land management practices. Emphasis has shifted from management regimes that focus on individual sites towards those that include a detailed understanding of their broader hydrological context and landscape setting. Throughout the paper, I will reflect on the way Martin's research has complemented, influenced and contributed to the evolving research agenda for England's wetlands. © the individual authors and Archaeopress 2021.

J. Mant,2021,The romance of form,"This chapter is concerned with the properties of both the physical archive and the digital archive. One of the attractions of the archive is the physical form of the record: the leather-bound volume, copperplate handwriting, silvered photographs-the colour, smell and sight of past generations. The challenge for the digital archive has been whether it ought or should replicate this romance of the physical form. Debates about the merits of encapsulation or retaining a record's 'look and feel', dominated early discussions about digital preservation. But does the attraction of the digital archive lie in other conceptualisations? While the aim of born-digital records preservation is to ensure access to information over time, emotional connections are harder to provide. Rather it is in the contextual relationships, the spider-web of search and discovery, where the digital archive can be most powerful. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. All rights reserved."
J.

The principal guidance to the study was attributed to international preservation guidelines, standards, and best practices. The study adopted a qualitative approach, along with the employment of these data collection methods: interviews, observation, and document review. Purposive sampling technique was used to select the target population, which included the deputy director, senior archivist, and the archives officer. Data was subjected to thematic analysis in line with the set objectives. The key research findings of the study indicated that there were no long-term preservation strategy for AV archives at BNARS, there was absence of archival access and no acquisition policies in place, various types of AV materials were all stored under the same roof and under the same climatic conditions. Furthermore, some AV archives were not processed thus making it hard to identify, retrieve, and make them accessible for use. Additionally, the research reflected that there was lack of requisite special technical skills needed for long-term preservation of AV archives. Finally, the study revealed that there was no specific budget for the long-term preservation of AV archives at BNARS. In conclusion, therefore, the study recommends that, BNARS develop a holistic AV preservation strategy to ensure the long-term availability and accessibility of AV archives for future use. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Digital information has important economic value as a cultural product and as a source of knowledge, but this generated information must be preserved, without information, there is no inheritance or culture. Digital heritage is not subject to temporal, geographic, cultural or format limits. But the digital heritage of the world is in danger of being lost for posterity, which is why it is important to preserve them in an adequate manner so that they are accessible, authentic and usable in the long term, under international professional standards. Data in digital form is the main source of knowledge for our students. The repositories in the educational institutions allow not only to store the intellectual production but also the documentation created by the administrative part of the universities. The intellectual capital of universities should not only be stored but also preserved and made known to the community. It is important to investigate adequate techniques for the digital preservation of data in universities, applying or generating digital preservation models that adapt to the unique characteristics of universities. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

It is an important proposition that the She and Chinese costume culture can be inherited in a sustainable way. This study is based on field surveys and interviews in She villages in Zhejiang Province. Grounded theory was used to build the ecosystem of the She minority's costume culture. Ecological postmodernism was used to consider ways to develop the intrinsic value of the She costumes to clarify the core vitality of their culture and to explore the contemporary inheritance and development path of their costumes. Based on the data, 111 initial concepts and 20 core concepts were identified, as well as six major axis codes and two systems. The ecosystem of the She's costume culture includes tangible and intangible features: the core of the costume culture includes the belief concept of loyal descendants,"" the social concept of ""equality and respect,"" and the natural concept of ""things as one."" The study indicates that a holistic perspective of costume inheritance is needed to achieve cohesion between the knowledge information society and traditional cultural heritage. The inheritance of She costume culture can be facilitated by complex technology such as 3D printing, virtual reality, and digital preservation."""
J. Yee,2021,Incompatible: The Challenges in Preserving Taiwanese Video Games,"With the COVID 19 pandemic forcing the majority of the world to stay indoors over the last year, demand for in home entertainment such as video games has grown immensely.While this has led to some incredibly positive outcomes for the gaming industry, namely profit and recognition, it has also uncovered some of the problems in the development and distribution of video games. In March and April of this year, the issue of game preservation made major headlines when Sony announced it would shut down the online store for its older PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable systems. This decision and the discourse it spawned inadvertently placed a spotlight on the problem of how companies can control the lifespan of digital media such as video games. As Taiwanese video games like Detention, Devotion, and Carto are finally pushing Taiwanese popular culture onto the world stage, it is of utmost importance to ensure we can preserve this kind of digital heritage for future generations to appreciate.Using case studies from research done while working with Taiwanese video games, this paper aims to explore the challenges that hinder the proper preservation of video games and other digital media. From this investigation, some of the major issues uncovered in preserving video games include digital rights management software, operating system fragmentation, firmware incompatibility, region locking, hardware obsolescence, and digital storefront availability. A final challenge unique to Taiwanese video game preservation, is related to politics, namely the influential power that Chinese netizens, companies, and the CCP itself have over Taiwanese game sales and distribution. Each of these issues affects preservation in a different way and different approaches are needed to find viable solutions. While it would be ideal that game developers and publishers would hold the biggest responsibility for solving these problems, many solutions end up coming from fan communities even though they have far fewer tools at their disposal.Throughout this paper many problems and solutions are discussed on a consumer-impacting level, while also highlighting how the technological friction caused by the entire process can alter one's experience of the game they want to play. This friction, which on the surface may merely seem inconvenient today, can actually have major ramifications for future researchers. By showcasing the entire process involved in getting several different Taiwanese video games running on modern devices, this paper demonstrates that not only are many of the problems plaguing digital media preservation avoidable, but also that these problems could be responsible for altering future players' access to the works. As the world continues to become more and more online and our digital media landscape continues to grow, it is of the utmost importance that more work needs to be done to ensure that the process for future digital media preservation be streamlined as soon as possible."
K. Fatima; N. Fatima,2021,Investigation of Preventive Conservation of Library Materials in National Library of India,"Preventive Conservation being interdisciplinary in nature has been implemented by libraries from the time when libraries were considered merely as storehouses of knowledge. Since inception, libraries have taken the responsibility to preserve the library materials for a prolonged life. The present study is undertaken to survey the preventive conservation activities in National Library of India. For this purpose, a well structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to the head of the library and concerned library professionals who are directly engaged in preventive conservation activities of the library. Results of the study show that all the basic methods of preventive conservation like pest management, climate control, access system, proper storage, binding, disaster planning, digitization and digital preservation are taken up by National Library in an effective way. It is however suggested that the library the library should work towards filing up the vacant positions of the library, specially of the Biding division- where books are immune against deterioration to survive a long life. © 2021.

K. Król,2021,Digital cultural heritage of rural tourism facilities in Poland,"Purpose: At the turn of 2018 and 2019, a certain era in the history of Polish Internet came to an end. Most of the websites of rural tourism facilities hosted on free servers no longer exist; however, the very phenomenon has significantly distinguished itself in the promotion of rural tourism in Poland. The paper presents archaic websites or rural tourism facilities in Poland as digital cultural heritage assets. Its purpose is to propose attributes potentially indicative of content or phenomenon being part of digital cultural heritage. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 211 websites of rural tourism facilities in Poland, hosted on free servers, were analysed. The study investigated digital artefacts, i.e. only the websites that no longer exist but whose archival copies are found at the Internet Archive (IA). Findings: The structure of most websites of rural tourism facilities was based on tables. None of the websites were responsive. The graphics of 132 websites (65%) were never changed, with the oldest recorded copies dating back to 2001 and the newest ones to 2018. On many websites, components that are relatively rarely found these days were noted, e.g. “marquee”-type “floating” objects or online surveys. Originality/value: The phenomenon of using free-of-charge hosting services by rural tourism facilities in Poland in the years 2004–2012 is part of the history of Polish Internet and an example of digital cultural heritage. Archaic websites of rural tourism facilities in Poland are digital artefacts but not all of them have cultural values. In total, three groups of attributes are proposed that can be important for determining whether a website, content or phenomenon can be considered digital cultural heritage assets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Abeygunawardhana,2021,Digital Preservation and Noise Reduction using Machine Learning,"This paper proposes a digital preservation solution for Sinhala audios to conserve those as documents with noise reduction. The solution has implemented multiple noise reduction techniques as a pre-processing step to remove unwanted internal and external noises. A two-step, two-way noise reduction process is applied to produce clean audios based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) and adaptive filter-based techniques. This approach implements two separate noise reduction models for internal and external noises. After that, the speech recognition decoder recognizes the speech and converts it to a Unicode document by acoustic, language, and pronunciation models using extracted audio features from the denoised audio. Further, noise reduction models are decoupled from the preservation solution and exposed as a sub solution for multilingualism noise reduction, supporting English and Sinhala audios. © 2021 IEEE."

L. Antoniazzi,2021,Digital preservation and the sustainability of film heritage,"This paper addresses the lack of published work on the preservation of digital materials within European film heritage institutions (FHIs). 1 In the long-term, technological change might have relevant consequences, on the sustainability of film preservation, affecting the ability to write film history and experience cultural memories. Although there is general awareness of the complexity and the cost of maintenance of digital preservation infrastructures, we have little knowledge of what specifically film heritage institutions are doing to address these challenges. Based on elite interviews with leading film archivists and analysis of relevant policy documents, this paper shows that FHIs are actively engaging with technological and institutional change and implementing valuable initiatives. However, this paper confirms that, roughly 10 years since the widespread of digital cinema distribution, FHIs are generally still striving to provide long-term sustainable and trustworthy solutions to safeguard the digital materials that they are acquiring or creating via digitisation. Although some institutions have built fairly reliable infrastructures, problems still arise from the instability of the information technology sector and from its persistent strategies of planned obsolescence. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

M. A. Kolar; D. Ko; S.

Here we report on human-centered acoustical data collection strategies from our project Digital Preservation and Access to Aural Heritage via a Scalable, Extensible Method,"" supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in the USA. The documentation and accurate translation of human sensory perspectives is fundamental to the ecological validity of cultural heritage fieldwork and the preservation of heritage acoustics. Auditory distance cues, which enable and constrain sonic communication, relate to proxemics, contextualized understandings of distance relationships that are fundamental to human social interactions. We propose that source-receiver locations in aural heritage measurements should be selected to represent a comprehensive range of proxemics according to site-contextualized spatial-use scenarios, and we identify and compare acoustical metrics for auditory distance cues from acoustical fieldwork we conducted using this strategy in three contrasting case-study heritage sites. This conceptual shift from architectural acoustical sampling to aural heritage sampling prioritizes culturally and physically plausible human auditory/sound-sensing perspectives and relates them to spatial proxemics as scaled architecturally."""

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic introduced an array of challenges in the operation of SRLs. The subsequent laboratory shutdowns and access restrictions brought to the forefront well-established practices that withstood the impact of a sudden change in operations and illuminated areas that need improvement. The most significant challenges from a data management perspective were data access for remote analysis and workstation management. Notably, lessons learned from this challenge emphasize the importance of safeguarding collected data from loss in various emergencies such as fire or natural disasters where the physical hardware storing data could be directly affected. Here, we describe two data management systems that have been successful during the current emergency created by the pandemic, specifically remote access and automated data transfer. We will discuss other situations that could arise and lead to data loss or challenges in interpreting data. (c) 2020 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry"
M. Finn; E. Mohamed; B. Momani,2021,Digital archiving of diasporic cultural productions and transnational citizenship of arabs in the west,"When transnationally constructed art forms, such as the works of diasporic cultural productions of Arabs in the West, are made available in open-source on a digital archive, this supports the transnational flow or exchange of citizenship-enhancing ideas, skill-sets, technologies, tools, capacities, and practices. In this theoretical investigation, we explore imagined outcomes when new audiences can engage with diasporic cultural productions of Arabs. Digital archiving of ethnically diverse cultural productions can expand civility, solidarity, and common ground among people; these latter behaviors are the ideational foundations of agency-based claims of transnational citizenship. Such cultural productions help to reconfigure the questions, oppor-tunities, and nature of political and social agency in ways that empower diaspora communities and expand their abilities to make citizenship claims in multiple societies. This is what the Internet enables despite its tendency towards parochialism in globalized pockets. Moreover, we highlight the possibilities of open-source digital archiving—with a focus on literature, poetry, biographies, and letters—for agency-based claims of citizenship and the many caveats that require further attention and consideration. © Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies 2021."

The library has partnered with Doxie.AI to develop a customized machine learning pipeline for extracting structured data from these records A number of challenges have arisen due to variability in content, structure, and placement of text on the page, and the presence of a wide variety of characteristics in the archival records that produce visual noise. This has prompted an iterative and dynamic approach to process records by camp. By blending library staff's content and domain knowledge with the technical expertise of Doxie.AI, the project team is meeting or exceeding baseline targets for accuracy rates across the majority of fields. Additionally, ethical issues pertaining to the digital release of this data and the digitized records in their entirety will be explored with a Community Advisory Group, as the library seeks to establish a responsible digital curation plan for these resources.

Phiri,2021,Effective ingestion of digital objects in institutional repositories using subject repositories,"The online visibility of scholarly research output from the Global South is cited as being low. This is despite the increased number of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) setting up institutional Repositories (IR), to facilitate the collection, long-term preservation and effective access to scholarly research output. One of the most common challenges faced by HEIs is ensuring regular ingestion of digital objects in IRs. In order to address this challenge, we propose the use of subject IRs by HEIs in order to facilitate the increased online visibility of scholarly research output. This paper outlines a case study conducted at The University of Zambia (UNZA), in order to demonstrate the feasibility of using subject IR at relatively large HEIs. A situational analysis was conducted to determine the relative effectiveness of ingesting digital objects at UNZA, and additionally, a subject repository was implemented in order to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing subject repositories. The results suggest that it is feasible to implement usable subject repositories, presenting opportunities to decentralise the ingestion of digital objects at large HEIs. This has the obvious benefit of facilitating effective self-archiving of digital objects and the subsequent increased online visibility of scholarly research output. © 2021 IST-Africa Institute and Authors."

Apocalypse,2021,Convergences between digital curation and information design in the post custodial context of information science,"Objective: Identify the approximations between Digital Curation (DC) and Information Design (ID) in the context of Information Science (IS) and point out the contributions of these convergences to the efficiency and effectiveness of information curation on Web environments. Methodology: The methodology applied theoretical and exploratory with a qualitative approach, from bibliographic searches and systematization of the retrieved data. Thus, the main concepts of DC and ID as disciplines in the context of IS were retrieved, the convergences between the disciplines in the context of IS as an interdisciplinary area were presented and discussed. Results: The curation of digital information according to the criteria of the DC provides subsidies to improve the processes of each stage of its life cycle. ID and its dimensions, in turn, subsidize the planning and development of digital environments with a focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the information communicated. In the theoretical-practical scope, the convergences between the actions of DC and the dimensions of ID provide opportunities for their multidirectional complementation. Considerations: The convergences between DC and the ID were demonstrated by the combination of elements present in subgroups of DC actions with elements present in the systematization of the ID in dimensions. There were points in common between the two disciplines that indicate the need for the convergence of their resources in the search for solutions to problems involved in the curation of digital information. The hypothesis that the two disciplines converge and potentialize solutions of complex informational problems in this context is confirmed. © Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

In this perspective, this study aims to understand how Digital Curation and Information Design in Information Science contribute to information presentation, access and sharing in these digital environments on the Web. The general objective was to contextualize the concepts and definitions of Digital Curation and Information Design to identify possible articulations for information organization and its presentation of women's museums digital collections. The study is qualitative in nature and descriptive-exploratory. It consisted of a bibliographic review of the themes correlated with data collection in the scope of collections and digital environments of women's museums, through information from the International Association of Women's Museums and Patrimonio en Femenino. The results showed a low number of digital collections available and also the need for reflection on the methodology of planning and creating digital environments as a laboratorial process, continuous, in perpetual beta, iterative and in successive improvements.

M. Polchow,2021,Exploring Perpetual Access,"When libraries transitioned their collection development from primarily print to greater reliance on e-resources, acquisition methods also shifted from a sales contract to a licensing business model. This shift effected the long-held perception that academic libraries support education and research through the preservation and provision of the scholarly record in perpetuity. Libraries can encourage copyright holders to participate in digital preservation initiatives, but to date few initiatives have seen a large uptake. Open Access publishing further amplifies this vulnerable situation. At risk is the assurance that digital scholarly content in all formats remains available to future users. This review of the digital preservation landscape examines a variety of case studies that shed light on the impact e-resource licensing strategies have on safeguarding perpetual access; the use of the unique rights libraries have under copyright law to preserve intellectual property; and the technological access complexities of digital preservation. Recognizing that practical, economic, and culturally responsive initiatives are limited by a library’s local capacity, the need to preserve e-resources has energized an increasing number of collaborative solutions. Using the Institute of Museum and Library Services’ concept that local efforts help build a National Digital Platform, this scan of diverse initiatives explores the evolving framework emerging in support of ensuring future access to digital scholarship. © 2021, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

M. Reimsbach; J. Aycock,2021,Decoding the Cauzin Softstrip: a case study in extracting information from old media,"Having content in an archive is of limited value if it cannot be read and used. As a case study of extricating information from obsolete media, making it readable once again through deep learning techniques, we examine the Cauzin Softstrip: one of the first two-dimensional bar codes, released in 1985 by Cauzin Systems, which could be used for encoding all manner of digital data. Softstrips occupy a curious middle ground, as they were both physical and digital. The bar codes were printed on paper, and in that sense are no different in an archival way than any printed material. Softstrips can be found in old computer magazines, computer books, and booklets of software Cauzin produced. However, managing the digital nature of these physical artifacts falls within the scope of digital curation. To make the information on them readable and useful, the digital information needs to be extracted, which originally would have occurred using a physical Cauzin Softstrip reader. Obtaining a working Softstrip reader is already extremely difficult and will most likely be impossible in the coming years. In order to extract the encoded data, we created a digital Softstrip reader, making Softstrip data accessible without needing a physical reader. Our decoding strategy is able to decode over 91% of the 1229 Softstrips in our Softstrip corpus; this rises to 99% if we only consider Softstrip images produced under controlled conditions. Furthermore, we later acquired another set of 117 Softstrips and we were able to decode nearly 95% of them with no adjustments to the decoder. These excellent results underscore the fact that technology like deep learning is readily accessible to non-experts; we obtained these results using a convolutional neural network, even though neither of the authors are expert in the area. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical and applied investigation using mixed methods to collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data from three sources: the Internet Archive and the public collection of Archive-It, the Portuguese web archive, and a selection from collections compiled by a research group (UFRGS) on web archiving and digital archiving in Brazil. Findings: Web archive initiatives started in 1996; however, over the years collections have narrowed from nationally relevant themes to specialized thematic niches. The theme “climate change” has had an increasing impact on scientific and mainstream discussion in the 2000s, and by 2010 the over-arching theme became focused on digital preservation of web content, as demonstrated in this study. Failure to preserve data can lead to a rapid loss of climate change information, due to the inherent ephemerality of the web. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates the relevance of preserving web content on climate change by showing what has been preserved to date and what will need to be preserved in the future. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Hence, the need for preservation and conservation of the cultural, social, and technical context of our heritage is germane. Purpose: The study examined the preservation and conservation of information resources in the selected private university libraries in South-west Nigeria. Eight (8) selected private universities in South-west, Nigeria with the population consisted of one hundred thirty-seven respondents which comprised of library professionals and para-professionals. Method: The study employed a survey research design and random sampling technique. Data collected with the aids of semi-structured questionnaire and was analysed using frequency, mean and standard deviation with the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM-SPSS) version 20.0 Results: The findings revealed that the book becoming torn is the highest nature of deterioration followed by vandalisation, mutilation and brittle of print library materials. Moreover, the study revealed that digital preservation level of utilisation is low and is not extensively used in selected private university libraries. Conclusion: The study concluded that preservation and conservation techniques are recognized in the selected university libraries, but the digital preservation techniques are not adequately used due to various constraints. One of the recommendations made was the provision of formal training for library staff on preservation and conservation of information resources. © 2021, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies.

Besides the institutions, the role of private archaeological contractors has grown in the last decade and recently non-commercial associations have been founded. According to the Austrian Monument Protection Act, the Federal Monuments Authority issues permits for any archaeological excavation or survey activity. Documentation and preservation of physical material are regulated by the Monument Protection Act as well as by dedicated guidelines published by the Federal Monuments Authority. With the recent increased use of digital methods, the importance of preserving and disseminating digital data has risen.

N. A. Çayirezmez; P. Hacigüzeller; T. Kalayci,2021,Archaeological Digital Archiving in Turkey,"This article provides a brief overview of archaeological digital archiving in Turkey. It introduces the legal framework and the stakeholders involved in conducting archaeological excavations and surveys. The current situation in archiving born-digital and digitised documentation produced during archaeological fieldwork is then introduced. Existing repositories serving as hubs for archaeological and heritage archiving are listed and briefly discussed. Analysis of online publishing practices for archaeological digital resources points to an eclectic landscape that only minimally complies with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. We conclude that guidelines for best practice in metadata and semantic technologies, locally applicable standards (especially controlled vocabularies), technical know-how, and a larger acceptance of open data and scholarship remain much-needed assets for archaeological digital archiving in Turkey. We also conclude that the future promises progress towards more interoperable archaeological digital archives thanks to international training, network and knowledge transfer opportunities (e.g. SEADDA Project). © 2021 Council for British Archaeology.

N.

Starting from this assumption, we have to rethink digital and digitization as social and cultural expressions of the contemporary age. We need to rethink digital libraries produced by digitization as cultural entities and no longer as mere dataset for enhancing fruition of cultural heritage, by defining clear and homogeneous criteria to validate and certify them as memory and sources of knowledge for future generations. By expanding R: Re-usable of the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship into R4: Re-usable, Relevant, Reliable and Resilient, this paper aims to propose a more reflective approach to creation of descriptive metadata for managing digital resource of cultural heritage, which can guarantee their long term preservation. © 2020, The Author(s)."

Mishra,2021,An analysis of difficulties faced in job duties by academic digital library professionals working in university libraries in Delhi (India),"The present study aims is to analyze the difficulties faced in performing the job duties by academic digital library professionals working in university libraries of Delhi (India). The survey method was adopted in the present study. The study is based on a questionnaire containing 34 job duties performed in academic digital libraries, classified into four categories, i.e. IT system management, information organization, user services, and collection management. The respondents were 146 library professionals working in university libraries in Delhi (India). The study found that professionals rated the difficulty of job duties such as network management and operation; hardware installation & upgradation; software selection and license management; library website development; database management; troubleshooting; accessing open-source software; working on content management softwares; handling digital preservation practices; initiating and managing digitization projects; providing access to eResources; maintaining an e-learning system; creating an institutional repository and budget planning and allocation as 'high.' 'Very high' difficulty rated job duties were handling library back-end servers, system analysis, and design and working on e-resource management software. The study may help library schools review the curriculum according to the difficulties faced by academic library professionals in the job market. In addition, findings will be helpful to review the curriculum updates which should be incorporated in library schools of India. © 2021,University of Nebraska - Lincoln, All Rights Reserved"
N. Tallman,2021,A 21st Century Technical Infrastructure for Digital Preservation,"Digital preservation systems and practices are rooted in research and development efforts from the late 1990s and early 2000s when the cultural heritage sector started to tackle these challenges in isolation. Since then, the commercial sector has sought to solve similar challenges, using different technical strategies such as software defined storage and function-as-a-service. While commercial sector solutions are not necessarily created with long-term preservation in mind, they are well aligned with the digital preservation use case. The cultural heritage sector can benefit from adapting these modern approaches to increase sustainability and leverage technological advancements widely in use across Fortune 500 companies. © 2021"

Sugimoto,2021,Wikidata Centric Vocabularies and URIs for Linking Data in Semantic Web Driven Digital Curation,"Wikidata is evolving as the hub of Linked Open Data (LOD), with its language-neutral URIs and close adherence to Wikipedia. Well defined URIs help the data to be interoperable and linkable. This paper examines the possibilities of utilizing Wikidata as the means of a vocabulary resource for promoting the use of linkable concepts. Digital curation projects are vibrant with varying demands and purposes, which makes them less suitable for adopting any common vocabularies or ontologies. Also, developing and maintaining custom vocabularies are expensive processes for smaller projects in terms of resources and skill requirements. In general, Wikidata entities are well documented with Wikipedia entries, and Wikipedia entries express the conceptual and hierarchical relations in detail with provisions to modify or create. The authors explain the concept of using Wikidata as a vocabulary source with a proof of concept module implementation for Omeka-S, a widely adapted open source digital curation platform. This paper is expected to show some practical insights on reliable an reasonable vocabulary development for social informatics as well as cultural heritage projects, with a notion to improve the quality and quantity of linkable data from digital curation projects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

The exploration of the valuable remains along the Thames River in London, the intervention with archaeology strategy, the use of digital survey procedures, the investigation of the references about the fleet, the digital modelling and drawing and the final online sharing of the 3D model, brought together to a specific digital heritage creation of an element with a high risk of getting lost. An international team worked together on the poor shipwreck of the Eothen (the last name assigned to this ship by its last owner). The intervention was operated in very odd operative conditions, with the hull invaded by the mud, the very wet environment and the daily flood of the area, such a mix of difficult conditions were a special challenge for the survey operations, which were optimized and accurately planned to allow the best and efficient result in terms of coverage and level of details. The following post-processing aimed to the production of a classic set of 2D drawings and an interactive 3D model, accessible in a real-time visualization from the sketchfab.com platform creates an excellent base for a possible following restoration/musealisation intervention, or, at least, allow digital preservation of a rich dataset of the remains of this interesting piece from the naval history of the first half of the 20th century. © 2021.

P. Shan; W. Wang; W. Zhao; Z. Yang,2021,Reconstruction of somatosensory interaction in Fuzhou Shadow Play based on depth image recognition,"Objective According to the characteristics of Fuzhou Shadow Play, digital reconstruction and innovative display are carried out through somatosensory interaction to enhance the audience's senses of participation and immersion, provide a new technical path for Intangible Cultural Heritage Inheritance and digital protection, and make the audience feel the charm of Chinese excellent traditional cultures. Methods On Microsoft Kinect 2.0 equipped with a CMOS depth sensor, depth data are acquired through the time-of-flight (TOF) ranging algorithm, which is based on the two-way ranging information technology of asynchronous transceivers. By collecting the depth image within the field-of-view of an infrared camera, the sensor uses a high-speed generated image stream with depth information to reproduce the scene in three dimensions. The optimized preprocessing shortens the evaluation of images with depth information, which is used to identify various parts of the human body. In the depth image, a specific mask area is created for each tracked viewer. Each pixel in the mask is transmitted to a machine learning system to identify various parts of the human body. Each recognized part is marked with the possibility of a specific pixel for the part, and a complete skeleton system is generated according to the coordinates of the 20 joint points tracked. Then the three-dimensional space data of the human body limbs are sent to the computer. Results Subsequent interactive reconstruction shows the human body movement and the joint point shadow puppet model movement match well, without model interspersion or bone damage. Conclusions The threedimensional digital preservation of shadow puppet entity realized by the construction of a joint point shadow puppet model eliminates time and space limitations against preservation of shadow puppet entity, highlights the immersion experience and reconstruction of drama time and space, creates a new interactive relationship of traditional drama performance, and changes the way of performing, viewing and creating Fuzhou shadow puppet art. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

P. Wang; J. A. Toque; A. Ide-Ektessabi,2021,A 2.5D surface structure reconstruction method using an imaging system with linear sensor,"In digital archiving of cultural heritages that have uneven and textured surfaces, it is challenging for researchers to acquire as much information as possible without having to used multiple techniques or devices. In this paper, a line-sensor camera based photometric stereo method for high-resolution 2.5D surface shape reconstruction is proposed. Compared to using an area sensor-based camera, a line sensor-based one can acquire higher resolution images with less geometric distortion, which can yield more accurate depth map results. A technique for estimating the lighting direction based on such system is addressed in detail for high-resolution surface shape reconstruction with improved efficiency. Experimental results yielded reconstructed depth maps comparable with the accuracy of conventional method like a laser ranger. In addition to surface reconstruction, the images acquired are colorimetrically accurate. This means that the method can produce both stereoscopic and spectroscopic information for digitizing cultural heritage with textured surfaces.

Zhou,2021,Towards a Sustainable Infrastructure for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage and Digital Scholarship,"The digital lifecycle encompasses definitive processes for data curation and management, long-term preservation, and dissemination, all of which are key building blocks in the development of a digital library. Maintaining a complete digital lifecycle workflow is vital to the preservation of digital cultural heritage and digital scholarship. This paper considers digital lifecycle programs for digital libraries, noting similarities between the digital and print lifecycles and referring to the example of the Digital Dunhuang project. Only through a systematic and sustainable digital lifecycle program can platforms for cross-disciplinary research and repositories for large aggregations of digital content be built. Moreover, advancing digital lifecycle development will ensure that knowledge and scholarship created in the digital age will have the same chances for survival that print-and-paper scholarship has had for centuries. It will also ensure that digital library users will have effective access to aggregated content across different domains and platforms. © 2021 Peter X. Zhou, published by Sciendo"
R. A. N. De Farias; I. F. De Lima,2021,The librarian in the implication of digital preservation through the analysis of public universities' management policies repositories,"Objetive. The Institutions interested in digital preservation need to plan, invest and organize themselves, adopting guidelines and a technological infrastructure for this process. Its objective is to present an analysis of the role of the librarian in digital preservation through the Information policies of the Institutional Repositories of national public universities. Method. The Bardin's method was used to analyze the content of informational policies, and the research was characterized as descriptive and explanatory. The research approach was quantitative-qualitative and the research method used for theoretical foundation was bibliographic and documentary. The research universe was the information policies of Institutional Repositories on the websites of universities present in the register of the National Registry of Higher Education Courses and Institutions (e-MEC) - official database of Higher Education Courses and Institutions - IES, contemplating municipal, federal and state public universities, according to the administrative category of the e-MEC Registry. Results. The policy's analyzes were carried out from March to August 2020, covering 51 institutional repositories. There were 21 public universities that did not have a documented policy, with prevalence in the Southeast region. The scenario shows the inexpressiveness of the implications of the managing librarian in the preparation of guidelines and mechanisms to guarantee the control and digital preservation of the national and intellectual production generated by the institution. Conclusions. The digital preservation policy is not yet documented by the vast majority of national public institutional repositories, so it is essential that the librarian be part of the institutional repository preservation team in compliance with the fundamental guidelines for long-term preservation. © 2021 University of Pittsburgh.

R. Appuswamy; V. Joguin,2021,Universal Layout Emulation for Long-Term Database Archival,"Research on alternate media technologies, like film, synthetic DNA, and glass, for long-term data archival has received a lot of attention recently due to the media obsolescence issues faced by contemporary storage media like tape, Hard Disk Drives (HDD), and Solid State Disks (SSD). While researchers have developed novel layout and encoding techniques for archiving databases on these new media types, one key question remains unaddressed: How do we ensure that the decoders developed today will be available and executable by a user who is restoring an archived database several decades later in the future, on a computing platform that potentially does not even exist today? In this paper, we make the case for Universal Layout Emulation (ULE), a new approach for future-proof, long-term database archival that advocates archiving decoders together with the data to ensure recovery. In order to do so, ULE brings together concepts from Data Management and Digital Preservation communities by using emulation for archiving decoders. In order to show that ULE can be implemented in practice, we present the design and evaluation of Micr'Olonys, an end-to-end long-term database archival system that can be used to archive databases using visual analog media like film, microform, and archival paper. © CIDR 2021.All rights reserved"
R. M. Krug; O. L. Petchey,2021,Metadata Made Easy: Develop and Use Domain-Specific Metadata Schemes by following the dmdScheme approach,"Metadata plays an essential role in the long-term preservation, reuse, and interoperability of data. Nevertheless, creating useful metadata can be sufficiently difficult and weakly enough incentivized that many datasets may be accompanied by little or no metadata. One key challenge is, therefore, how to make metadata creation easier and more valuable. We present a solution that involves creating domain-specific metadata schemes that are as complex as necessary and as simple as possible. These goals are achieved by co-development between a metadata expert and the researchers (i.e., the data creators). The final product is a bespoke metadata scheme into which researchers can enter information (and validate it) via the simplest of interfaces: a web browser application and a spreadsheet. We provide the R package dmdScheme (dmdScheme: An R package for working with domain specific MetaData schemes (Version v0.9.22), 2019) for creating a template domain-specific scheme. We describe how to create a domain-specific scheme from this template, including the iterative co-development process, and the simple methods for using the scheme, and simple methods for quality assessment, improvement, and validation. The process of developing a metadata scheme following the outlined approach was successful, resulting in a metadata scheme which is used for the data generated in our research group. The validation quickly identifies forgotten metadata, as well as inconsistent metadata, therefore improving the quality of the metadata. Multiple output formats are available, including XML. Making the provision of metadata easier while also ensuring high quality must be a priority for data curation initiatives. We show how both objectives are achieved by close collaboration between metadata experts and researchers to create domain-specific schemes. A near-future priority is to provide methods to interface domain-specific schemes with general metadata schemes, such as the Ecological Metadata Language, to increase interoperability."
S. Abrams,2021,Tacit attitudinal principles for evaluating digital preservation success,"Digital preservation fulfills a critical role in the digital continuity of individual, institutional, and cultural memory. It is important for archival stewards and stakeholders to know whether or not those activities have been successful in order to deploy finite programmatic resources most relevantly, effectively, and productively. While preservation trustworthiness has been subject to extensive examination, the complementary evaluative quality of success has received less critical consideration. This study looks at how the preservation community ascribes meaning to the concept of success through attitudinal norms tacitly embedded in domain discourse. These are recovered through qualitative content analysis of selected preservation policy statements, which act as public affirmations of the archival service “contract” regarding stewardship intention and reciprocal stakeholder expectation. Success is a measure of the alignment between anticipated outcomes and actual preserved state resulting from intentional intervention. Communicological critique of the norms illuminates why the measure of success remains problematic and suggests avenues by which metrical practice can be augmented to enhance its evaluative power. This includes repositioning evaluative prerogatives to incorporate concern for the persistence not only of authentic digital information objects but also legitimate communicative experiences. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
S. de Albuquerque Siebra,2021,Planning in digital curation,"Reflects on planning in the context of digital curation. This is a descriptive and qualitative study, which uses bibliographic and documentary research. As a result, six dimensions were defined that should be explored in the planning and the elements within them, regardless of the type of digital object to be cured, they were: infrastructure, financial resources, human resources, actions related to digital preservation, legal and ethical issues and issues related to access and use of digital objects. Documents were indicated that must be produced during the planning to guide the project teams, such as the Digital Preservation Plan and, also, the importance of the participation of the target community of the curation project at this stage was emphasized. Finally, it was found that the descriptions of planning, in most digital curation models, are still succinct, technical and superficial and may not provide sufficient support for the realization of curatorship planning by institutions / organizations. It is concluded that it is necessary that information professionals are able to develop materials to fill this gap and to guide the implementation of digital curation projects. © 2020 Universidade Federal de Campina Grande.

It allows organizing of content in a systematic way, the so called Cinema Preservation Package (CPP). The standard defines methods to store content in physical and logical structures and describes relationships and metadata for its components. The CPP uses existing XML schemes, in particular METS, EBUCore and PREMIS to store structural, descriptive, technical and provenance metadata. METS XML files with their core metadata contain physical and logical structures of the content, hash values and UUIDs to ensure data integrity and links to external metadata files to enrich the content with additional information. The content itself is stored based on existing public and industry standards, avoiding unnecessary conversion steps.

S. Lyu; J. Mao; M. Hou,2021,Mural linear feature enhancement algorithm combining semi-supervised image segmentation and dimensionality reduction,"Due to the influence of natural and human factors, the linear features in the murals are partially blurred, which brings great challenges to the digital preservation and virtual restoration of cultural heritage. Taking the advantages of non-invasive measurement as well as the rich image and spectral information of hyperspectral technology, we proposed a linear feature enhancement method by combining semi-supervised superpixel segmentation with block dimension reduction. The main research work includes: (1) The true color composite image was segmented to obtain the label data by using the local spatial information of the superpixel image and the global feature information extracted by fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering.(2) According to the label data, the preprocessed hyperspectral data were divided into homogeneous regions, whose dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). (3) The principal component images with the largest gradient after dimensionality reduction were respectively selected and normalized. The optimal principal component images normalized by the block PCA and block KPCA dimensionality reduction algorithms are superimposed to produce the linear feature enhancement images of murals. The hyperspectral images of some murals in Qutan Temple, Qinghai Province, China were used to verify the method. The results show that the spatial information and the spectral information of different pattern areas in the hyperspectral image can be fully used by combining the superpixel FCM image segmentation algorithm with the dimensionality reduction algorithm. of.

S. Merrill,2021,"Buffing and buffering Blu: the societal performance of street art, heritage erasure and digital preservation in Berlin","In December 2014 two of Berlin’s most famous street art murals were painted black. Fans of the murals responded by using social media to blame the owner of the ‘Cuvrybrache’–the vacant plot in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg that the murals overlooked. Many assumed that a campaign to heritage-list the murals in response to the Cuvrybrache’s planned redevelopment had led the plot’s owners to take matters into their own hands. In fact, as this article details, it was more surprising who was responsible for the mural’s erasure: their creator, the street artist known as Blu. As some street art fans mourned their loss, the murals continued to be encountered by others, just as they always had, online. This article uses the case of the Cuvrybrache murals–replete with forces of ruination, processes of gentrification, and acts of iconoclasm–to explore the complexities of street art and heritage’s relationship with erasure and the manner by which this relationship is increasingly refracted through digital technologies and media. Drawing parallels between buffed urban walls and buffering digital screens, it argues that the pervasive digital preservation of street art encourages it and heritage in general to be further conceptualised as a societal performance. © 2020 The Author(s).

The objective of this article is to review the possibility of the adoption of open source software in the creation of digital libraries, highlights advantages and disadvantage preservations. Among our objective also explaining the request of such software at the present time and the criteria evaluated in the digital preservation through surveying the best open source software from the reality of intellectual production, and standards that are being built to evaluate and choose what software to create a digital library without other software available. To achieve the above objectives, we shed the light on the top 11 open-source software to manage Libraries in addition to standards that may represent the basic building block for the selection of the appropriate systems to the needs of the digital library. This article relied on the descriptive approach by reviewing a series of studies and scientific research works related to the subject of the current study. Accordingly, the most prominent of the findings of this work is its illustration of the close association between open source software and the library community, both of which represent free culture. Also it is shown that the selection process of open source software has some obstacles most notably as there are no clear and reliable criteria for selecting these systems.

Design/methodology/approach: Through the multiple case study research design, data was obtained from eight respondents in four Indigenous Knowledge Systems Documentation Centers (IKSDCs) in institutions that are part of the National Recordal Systems (NRS) initiative across four provinces in South Africa using in-depth face-to-face interviews. Data collected was also supplemented with the content analysis of several policy documents in South Africa. Findings: The findings reveal that there are no digital preservation policies in place in the institutions, especially long-term digital preservation for IKS. However, some of the institutions are formulating policies that will include the management of IKS collected in the institutions. This study also reveals that digital curation, policy formulation and disaster preparedness plans to some extent are measures said to be in place for the digital preservation of IKS. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses mainly on the NRS initiative in South Africa. Indigenous Knowledge (IK) related to traditional medicine, traditional plants and food are currently being digitized at the IKSDCs by IK recorders. This study will help in ensuring that the South African Government’s effort and investment in digitizing IKS and making them accessible online is not wasted. This study will help mitigate the risk of damage and alteration over time, either deliberately or in error. Originality/value: This study fills a gap in the literature on the digitization and digital preservation of IKS from the context of the NRS project in South Africa. Very few studies have been carried out on the digital preservation of IKS in Africa.

Design/methodology/approach: The grounded theory methodology was adopted. For data collection, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 archivists in China. Data analysis was performed using the open coding, axial coding and selective coding to organise the archival knowledge composition of PA and develops the awareness-knowledge-action (AKA) integration model of archival knowledge application in the field of PA, according to the principles of the grounded theory. Findings: The archival knowledge involved in the field of PA comprises four principal categories: documentation, arrangement, preservation and appraisal. Three interactive factors involved in archivists' archival knowledge application in the field of PA behaviour: awareness, knowledge and action, which form a pattern of awareness leading, knowledge guidance and action innovation, and archivists' PA practice is flexible and innovative. The paper underscored that it is need to improve archival literacy among general public. Originality/value: The study constructs a theoretical framework to identify the specialised archival knowledge and skills of PA which is able to provide solutions for non-specialist PA and develops an AKA model to explain the interaction relationships between awareness, knowledge and action in the field of PA. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."
T. Ireland; T. Bell,2021,Chasing Future Feelings: A Practice-led Experiment with Emergent Digital Materialities of Heritage,"High-fidelity imaging methods such as laser scanning and digital photogrammetry have captured public and professional audiences in a flurry of optimistic discourse about their capacities as forms of preservation and of archaeological recording and interpretation. With technical finesse and mastery, endangered heritage can, it is argued, be captured, re-materialized, and recovered from the forces that threaten it. As the plot concerning our ‘digital futures’ thickens, we discuss here an experimental project that offers an oblique approach to the practice of 3D visualization, one that subverts the dominance of neutral, technical field engagements. We examine digital materiality by exploring digital heritage objects as both method and site of ethnographic encounter. Orbiting the ruins of Asinou, an abandoned village in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, with our ‘low-tech’ equipment, we sought to observe the conditions of the ‘in-between’ of two makeshift forms, each as ‘real’ as the other. We focus our thinking on the tensions of translation that play on the surface of our technically crude digital assemblages, as spaces of generative potential for speculations about encounters with emerging digital materialities, their affective capacities and status as future heritage objects. © 2021, Tracy Ireland,Tessa Bell."
T. Kusber; S. Schwalm; U. Korte; K.

T. M. Masenya,2021,Cloud computing as a strategy for preservation of digital resources in academic libraries in South Africa,"Academic libraries around the world have been struggling with how to preserve their intellectual output. Of all the preservation challenges facing academic libraries, none is more pressing than developing strategies for digital preservation. The chapter thus aimed at investigating the adoption of cloud computing as a strategy to preserve digital resources in academic libraries. Data collection was largely based on a critical review of literature relating to the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. The findings revealed that although cloud computing has been seen as one of suitable preservation strategies by many institutions, the level of its adoption is low in academic libraries in South Africa, especially in the area of preservation of digital resources. Several recommendations were also made, and among others were the enactment of preservation policies and improving technology infrastructure. The study further proposed a roadmap that will serve as a guide in the adoption of cloud computing in academic libraries. © 2022, IGI Global. All rights reserved."
T. M. Masenya,2021,Research data management practices and services in South African academic libraries,"Research data is being produced at a rapid rate in a wide variety of digital forms in academic and research institutions, however, this data is most prone to loss due to mismanagement. Proper management and preservation of this research data is essential for productivity, securing grant funding, enabling collaboration, increases data sharing, ensuring accessibility and the future use of data. Although academic libraries have recognised a need for effective management of research data, however, the management of their fast-growing number of research data poses major challenge to academic librarianship. The purpose of this study was to investigate the research data management practices and services within academic libraries in South Africa,in order to suggest solutions for effective research data management. Review of literature revealed that academic libraries are experiencing difficulties in managing their research data because of the absence of established policies and standards, inadequate standardised storage infrastructure, time constraint to organise data, limited funding, inadequate resources, lack of skills and training in managing research data and lack of incentives for researchers to share their data. All these challenges have created the dire need for best practices and solutions in ensuring proper management and long-term preservation of research data of enduring value in the academic libraries. Effective research data management strategies are thus needed to protect the enormous financial and time investments that have been made by mitigating data loss and avoiding the need for duplication of efforts to recreate lost data. The study suggests the need for implementation of research data management policies and strategies, provision of adequate resources, sufficient funding, collaborative approach and capacitating research data managers and administrators. © 2021.

V. Vassallo; A. Felicetti,2021,Towards an ontological cross-disciplinary solution for multidisciplinary data: VI-SEEM data management and the FAIR principles,"Different scientific communities produce different kinds of datasets that rely on different data descriptions, approaches, and logical organisations. In such an environment, it is essential to establish a knowledge communication framework that can guarantee some fundamentals, such as an inclusive description and documentation of the interdisciplinary digital resources, their long-term preservation, access, use, and reuse. The establishment of semantic knowledge integration aims at overcoming such inhomogeneity between data produced by different research communities. Specifically, we refer to those communities aggregated within the e-Infrastructure developed by the European project VI-SEEM: Life Science, Climate Science, and Digital Cultural Heritage. The current research proposes a framework based on CIDOC CRM and its extensions, in particular the CRMsci and CRMdig, and tested on examples identified as interdisciplinary respect to the different and various research areas of the project.

Since China started lunar exploration activities in 2007, the Ground Research and Application System (GRAS), one of the five systems developed as part of China's Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP) and the Planetary Exploration of China (PEC), has gradually established China's Lunar and Planetary Data System (CLPDS), which involves the archiving, management and long-term preservation of scientific data from China's lunar and planetary missions; additionally, data are released according to the policies established by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The scientific data archived by the CLPDS are among the most important achievements of the CLEP and PEC and provide a resource for the international planetary science community. The system plays a key and important role in helping scientists obtain fundamental and original research results, advancing studies of lunar and planetary science in China, and improving China's international influence in the field of lunar and planetary exploration. This paper, starting from CLEP and PEC mission planning, explains the sources, classification, format and content of the lunar and Mars exploration data archived in the CLPDS. Additionally, the system framework and core functions of the system, such as data archiving, management and release, are described. The system can be used by the international planetary science community to comprehensively understand the data obtained in the CLEP and PEC, help scientists easily access and better use the available data resources, and contribute to fundamental studies of international lunar and planetary science. Moreover, since China has not yet systematically introduced the CLPDS, through this article, international data organizations could learn about this advanced system. Therefore, opportunities for international data cooperation can be created, and the data service capability of the CLPDS can be improved, thus promoting global data sharing and application for all humankind."

Z. Wang; H. Liu,2021,Exploration of digital heritage strategy based on preventive conservation theory,"The frequent occurrence of heritage disasters highlights the necessity of digital preservation of heritage. There are two technical difficulties in Digitization: one is the high cost, the other is the poor applicability of the achievement. This is because the emphasis is only on data volume and accuracy, but neglecting the demand for conservation in the process of digitalization. Preventive Conservation has become the mainstream of heritage conservation. Based on this theory, this paper takes the digitization of several stone tablets in the Forbidden City as an opportunity to explore the strategy of digitization of heritage. Through the assessment of the values and state of preservation, the key points of digitization are obtained. By comparing the collection efficiency, achievement accuracy, expression characteristics, workload and cost of the various technologies, the authors draw a conclusion. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

A. Dekker,2022,NETWORKS OF CARE,"There is a need to preserve our digital cultural heritage for the future. However, the increasing speed with which technical media is used in digital preservation becomes obsolete, which leads to problems such as changes to the aesthetics and content of the artworks, organisational shifts, and ecological burden. Drawing from the concept of care and connecting this to the idea of networks of care, this chapter shows how the conceptualisation of care in digital preservation helps to comprehend the challenges of digital art preservation and networked culture more widely. By analysing three art projects in which networks have formed around the preservation of the project, the chapter emphasises that while there are multiple typologies of networks of care, there is a shared focus on a relational arrangement of care in which preservation is negotiated between different actors, including humans, but also material and technical elements. When acknowledging that these actors, and thus the care, may change over time, the implementation of networks of care can lead to more sustainable solutions for digital preservation. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Andrew Dewdney and Katrina Sluis."

Chen,2022,Traditional African Dances Preservation Using Deep Learning Techniques,"Human action recognition continues to evolve and improve through deep learning techniques. There have been studies with some success in the field of action recognition, but only a few of them have focused on traditional dance. This is because dance actions, especially in traditional African dance, are long and involve fast movements. This research proposes a novel framework that applies data science algorithms to the field of cultural preservation by applying various deep learning techniques to identify, classify, and model traditional African dances from videos. Traditional dances are an important part of African culture and heritage. Digital preservation of these dances in their multitude and form is a challenging problem. The dance dataset was constituted from freely available YouTube videos. Four traditional African dances were used for the dance classification process: Adowa, Swange, Bata, and Sinte dance. Five Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were used for the classification and achieved an accuracy between 93% and 98%. Additionally, human pose estimation algorithms were applied to Sinte dance. A model of Sinte dance that can be exported to other environments was obtained. © 2022 Owner/Author."
A. El-Fakdi; J. L. de la Rosa,2022,Evaluating Auction Mechanisms for the Preservation of Cost-Aware Digital Objects under Constrained Digital Preservation Budgets,"Digital preservation is a field of research focused on designing strategies for maintaining digital objects accessible for general use in the coming years. Out of the many approaches to digital preservation, the present research article is a continuation work of a previously published article containing a proposal for a novel object-centered paradigm to address the digital preservation problem where digital objects share part of the responsibility for self-preservation. In the new framework, the behavior of digital objects is modeled to find the best preservation strategy. The results presented in the current article add a new economic constraint to the object behavior. Now, differently from the previous paper, migrations, copies and updates are not free to use, but subject to budget limitations to ensure the economic sustainability of the whole preservation system, forcing the now-called cost-aware digital objects for efficient management of available budget. The presented approach compares two auction-based mechanisms, a multi-unit auction and a combinatorial auction, with a simple direct purchase strategy as possible efficient behaviors for budget management. TiM, a simulated environment for running distributed digital ecosystems, is used to perform the experiments. The simulated results map the relation between the studied purchase models with the sustained quality level of digital objects, as a measure of its accessibility, together with its budget management capabilities. About the results, the best performance corresponds to the combinatorial auction model. The results are a good approach to deal with the digital preservation problem from a sustainable point of view and open the door to future implementations with other purchase strategies."

During the summer of 2019, the author conducted oral history interviews with US Army soldiers at Fort Hood to address the questions of what personal records soldiers keep of their military experience, what they do if anything to preserve them, and how they value them. This study found that both military and socio-Technological factors contribute to a lack of digital recordkeeping among modern soldiers, that soldiers reliance on social media as ad hoc digital preservation tools leads to poor digital preservation practices, and that a majority of soldiers do not see their digital records as worthy of future historical study. The article concludes with a discussion of actions that can address these issues. © 2022 Society of American Archivists. All rights reserved."

A. Kriesberg; A. Acker,2022,The second US presidential social media transition: How private platforms impact the digital preservation of public records,"A second presidential social media transition in the United States occurred as Joe Biden took office on January 20, 2021. In the years since Barack Obama pioneered the use of platforms like Facebook and Twitter while President, Donald Trump shaped his Presidency around the use of Twitter, primarily through a personal account created before entering politics. In this paper, we examine Donald Trump's use of Twitter during his presidency as a lens through which to understand the ongoing archival preservation and data management challenges posed by social media platforms. The blurred lines between public and private records, deleting tweets, and the preservation issues that appeared after his suspension from Twitter and other platforms following the January 6, 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol all highlight an urgent, ongoing need by archivists, digital preservationists, and information scholars to consider how we might collect and manage social media records in an ever-changing information landscape. This paper draws primarily on publicly available information from existing preservation initiatives to analyze the state of digital preservation for presidential records. Our findings highlight how both public and private entities manage and provide access to Donald Trump's tweets, pointing to broader implications for social media data preservation. © 2022 Association for Information Science and Technology."
A. L. Cushing; G.

It contributes to the extant literature with a fresh perspective, expanding the discussion on AI adoption by investigating how it influences the perceptions of digital archival expertise. Design/methodology/approach: In this study a two-phase data collection consisting of four online focus groups was held to gather the opinions of international archives and digital preservation professionals (n = 16), that participated on a volunteer basis. The qualitative analysis of the transcripts was performed using template analysis, a style of thematic analysis. Findings: Four main themes were identified: fitting AI into day to day practice; the responsible use of (AI) technology; managing expectations (about AI adoption) and bias associated with the use of AI. The analysis suggests that AI adoption combined with hindsight about digitisation as a disruptive technology might provide archival practitioners with a framework for re-defining, advocating and outlining digital archival expertise. Research limitations/implications: The volunteer basis of this study meant that the sample was not representative or generalisable. Originality/value: Although the results of this research are not generalisable, they shed light on the challenges prospected by the implementation of AI in the archives and for the digital curation professionals dealing with this change.

A. Shibambu; N. S. Marutha,2022,A framework for management of digital records on the cloud in the public sector of South Africa,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate a framework for management of digital records on the cloud in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative case study used semi-structured interviews and document analysis to collect data from regulatory documents, records practitioners and chief information officers in the national government departments in South Africa. Findings: This study reveals that despite the advent of cloud computing, government is still struggling with manual paper-based records challenges, as they have not developed a government-owned cloud in which to manage and dispose records. Practical implications: Technological advancements have brought about dramatic changes to the management and disposition of records since cloud computing emerged. The traction gained by cloud computing influences how records are managed and disposed in the cloud storage. Currently, the South African Government manages and disposes records in the government premises as stipulated by the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa Act (1996). This is enforced by the National Archives and Records Service of South Africa, which is the government records regulator because records are on paper-based, microfilms and audio-visual formats. It is hoped that the recommendations and framework proposed in this study may assist the government and related sectors in the adoption and implementation of the cloud computing system for records management and disposal. This may assist in resolving challenges such as missing files, damaged records and archives and long turnaround time for retrieval of records. Social implications: In South Africa, the digital records are securely stored in storage mediums such as hard drives and USBs, to mention but a few. In addition to digital obsolescence faced by the storage mediums, global access to information is hindered because information is limited to those who can visit the archival holdings. The alternative option is to manage and dispose of records in the cloud. The framework and recommendations in this study may also assist in improving information, archives and records management policies and service delivery to the community at large. The framework proposed may be applied as a theory for framing future studies in the same area of cloud computing and used as a resource to guide other future studies and policymakers.

Supported by funding from the John P. McGovern Foundation, this initiative has proven complex and multifaceted, and one that has engaged the task force in a broad range of activities, from purchasing digitization equipment and software to designing a phased, multiyear plan to execute its charge. This plan is structured around digitization preparation (phase one), development of procedures and workflows (phase two), and promotion and communication to the project's targeted audiences (phase three). The plan contains step-by-step actions to conduct an environmental scan, inventory the theses and dissertations collections, purchase equipment, craft policies, establish procedures and workflows, and develop digital preservation and communication strategies, allowing the task force to achieve effective planning, workflow automation, progress tracking, and procedures documentation. The innovative and creative approaches undertaken by the Theses and Dissertations Digitization Task Force demonstrated collective intelligence resulting in scaled access and dissemination of the University's research and scholarship that helps to enhance the University's impact and reputation. © 2022."
B. Cannelli; M. Musso,2022,Social media as part of personal digital archives: exploring users’ practices and service providers’ policies regarding the preservation of digital memories,"After more than a decade of usage, social media have become a virtual environment where meaningful content is created and kept, highlighting its potential to become part of personal digital archives. This study investigates users’ attitudes and preservation practices related to digital memories created on social media. Survey findings highlighted how users seem to consider these items as meaningful digital traces to document important events of their lives, and a potential inherent part of their personal archives. However, results show how this attitude does not seem to be supported by adequate preservation strategies. After analysing social media platforms’ policies in relation to users’ preservation practices, we advocate for raising more awareness among both users and service providers regarding the risks posed by the ephemerality of the digital world and the need for specific provisions that go beyond the short-term retention of data and look to the future and potential use of what appears to be considered an inherent part of individuals’ personal archives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
B. F. Popovici,2022,SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON THE ARCHIVAL STORAGE IN DIGITAL PRESERVATION OF RECORDS,"Starting from the assumption that the carrier is no longer an intrinsic part of digital record (though still a necessary presence for the record to exist), the paper seeks to critically examine the role of storage in digital preservation of records. Is the carrier/storage area a topic of concern for archivists or it is rather a topic for IT professionals? Is longevity of carrier an important archival topic? Is the size of storage an important pre-requisite for a digital preservation system? The examination of these questions will consider both theoretical approaches and personal experiences of the author. © 2022, Maribor Provincial Archives. All rights reserved."

Systematized review,"Digital preservation is a necessary tool to achieve the integral and lasting preservation of all types of document files, especially sound files, vulnerable documents to technological changes, which when recorded and processed on specific media, quickly become obsolete. The objective of this systematized review was to identify the digital preservation strategies used in the preservation of sound resources and their applications according to its format. The bibliographic search was carried out in twelve multidisciplinary databases, selecting 16 articles for research, from which eleven digital preservation strategies were identified. It concluded that the most used strategies are migration, preservation metadata, backup copies and emulation. On the other hand, it was not possible to establish an application parameter for digital preservation strategies according to the type of format of the sound files. © 2022. CSIC.

C. Ohman,2022,The Case for a Digital World Heritage Label,"Much of humanity's most important digital heritage is under corporate control, which poses several threats to its longevity and authenticity. However, public institutions have little authority to intervene and preserve it, and their doing so is not always a desirable alternative. The goal of this article is to propose a mitigation of this dilemma. I do so in three steps. First, I introduce the concept of digital world heritage, which denotes digital artifacts with a value beyond their utility to any single individual or community. Second, I specify three ways commercial management threatens digital world heritage. Third, I argue that many of these threats may be mitigated by the introduction of a digital world heritage label. This proposal, I contend, does not interfere with the integrity of private data controllers since it does not involve the donation of data archives, yet it does support the longterm preservation of digital heritage."
C. Xie; X. Xia; H. Shishido; T. Matsui; I. Kitahara,2022,A VR Assisted Image Gathering Method for Digital Archiving of Cultural Properties,"Digital archiving cultural properties using 3D models can provide a more intuitive understanding of the 3D geometry. However, high-quality 3D model reconstruction using laser scanning is expensive and time-consuming. An image-based method like Structure from Motion (SfM) is a more cost-effective approach. Nevertheless, SfM requires many multi-view images to produce reliable results. Although the crowdsourcing approach can be applied to gather a large amount of image data from visitors, the quality of the data cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose an image-gathering method upon crowdsourcing. Our method contains a VR-assisted interface that the experts use to generate snapshot instructions for visitors to improve data quality. © 2022 IEEE."
C. Zuanni,2022,Contemporary Collecting in a Pandemic: Challenges and Solutions for Documenting the COVID-19 Pandemic in Memory Organizations,"This paper draws on a survey of contemporary collecting projects aiming to document the COVID-19 pandemic in museums and other memory organizations. The survey focused on European memory organizations and investigated the practices they adopted in collecting, accessioning, recording, preserving, and displaying material and immaterial witnesses of the pandemic. This paper presents the results of the survey, with a particular attention on the challenges faced by these projects in relation to born-digital objects. It discusses how organizations were able to quickly launch initiatives aimed at collecting memories of the pandemic, drawing on different collection methods, adapting to the circumstances, and using a proactive attitude to reach out to different communities. The paper highlights the solutions adopted to ensure legal compliance in these projects and discusses the need for ethical considerations in relation to the collection of traumatic memories. It suggests that these collecting projects are likely to face significant challenges in the subsequent processing of this material—due to its volume and the need for new digital curation and preservation workflows. Therefore, the paper argues that these projects could also lead to a renewed attention and collaboration across the heritage sector on issues of digital curation and preservation. © 2022 by the author."

Visualizing these data helps us to understand the complicated internal structure of the cultural heritage. Transparent stereoscopic visualization based on 3D point clouds is effective for understanding the complex structures of cultural heritage. However, the position and depth information often become unclear when three-dimensional data are rendered transparently. We examined whether perceived depth of transparently and stereoscopically visualized objects can be improved by highlighting 3D edges of the structure. We also investigated the effect of edge opacity on perceived depth. We tested two types of figures: vertically and horizontally combined shapes and diagonally combined shapes, which is extracted from the point cloud data of cultural heritage. We conducted psychophysical experiments, and the results suggest that edge highlighting improves the accuracy of perceived depth. Moreover, the effect of edge highlighting was more significant when binocular disparity and motion parallax were available. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
D. Formenton; L.

These standards are the ones that determine the persistence, consistency, comprehensibility, the access, and representation of selected sites, collected and stored in Web archives, besides defining the archivability of sites and the interoperability among systems. Objective: In this context, the objective of the article was to identify and define which metadata standards could be judged by memory institutions and universities so that they could enable digital preservation in Web archives. Methodology: For this, a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive research was done, using the bibliographic method from a non-systematic inventory together with a review and analysis of the literature content. The Dublin Core, MODS, EAD, VRA Core, PREMIS, and METS standards were selected and analyzed. Results and Conclusion: The analysis of the results indicates that Dublin Core, MODS, EAD, and VRA Core supported METS and PREMIS in detecting and documenting technical aspects of sites and proving their authenticity, context, and origin. METS can manage archived sites by acting as OAIS information packages, while Dublin Core proved to be an exponent for Web archiving through its use in remarkable area initiatives. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

Research data management is centrally implemented and formally defined in a data management plan to enable data curation. In tandem, data curation and management facilitate research repeatability. In contrast to other research fields, data curation and management in visualization are not yet part of the researcher's compendium. In this position paper, we discuss the unique challenges visualization faces and propose how data curation can be practically realized. We share eight lessons learned in managing data in two large research consortia, outline the larger curation workflow, and define the typical roles. We complement our lessons with minimum criteria for selecting a suitable data repository and five challenging scenarios that occur in practice. We conclude with a vision of how the visualization research community can pave the way for new curation standards. © 2022 IEEE."

In the current paper, the use of these technologies is demonstrated in the case of the First Ancient Theatre of Larissa, one of the largest and most important theatres in Greece, the restoration of which has been ongoing for more than 20 years. In the NSRF 2014-2020 funded project Restoration of the first Ancient Theatre of Larissa - Phase E"", part of the koilon (cavea) is restored by repositioning 300 ancient marble seats, ""edolia"", to their original or corresponding positions, and by the addition of 240 new ""edolia"", according to the approved restoration study. The koilon is documented through 3d laser scanning and photogrammetry methods to produce a three dimensional reconstructed model. Then, an as-designed model of the koilon is created, depicting the curvature, elevation and the new position of both ancient and new ""edolia"". Separate 3d models are created for each new ""edolio"" that incorporate all the information needed to produce them on a CNC machine, ensuring the best fit. The paper also presents the implementation of digital documentation in the project's execution where modern technology meets ancient techniques."""
D. Pearson; J. Doig,2022,"Tales from tHE disK FILES"": Lessons Learnt from a Data Recovery Project in 2003-2006 at the National Archives of Australia""","This case study re-evaluates a large-scale project carried out by the National Archives of Australia (NAA) between 2003 and 2006. The project aimed to identify obsolete digital media (physical data carriers) in its collection and to describe and recover the data from the carriers using a third-party data recovery provider.1 A detailed process for data recovery was developed that included the capture of a full audit trail of steps in the data recovery process. The project was completed in four stages: phase 1 obtained bit-level images from the carriers; phase 2 extracted individual bit-files from the carriers; phase 3 identified duplicate files and proprietary or complex file formats; and phase 4 was a final report that documented processes, made recommendations on future processes, and provided lessons learned. Recent work described in this article indicates that files extracted from the carriers in 2004 2005 can be accurately rendered in current computer environments. The ongoing significance of the project is that it is an early demonstration of the success of bit-level preservation and the need to create disk images as part of a preservation workflow, suggesting a sustainable methodology for digital preservation. The project also influenced archival policy at the NAA and influenced the development of subsequent software tools that became widely known in the broader digital preservation community. The focus on archival principles of authenticity, integrity, chain of custody, and provenance of the recovered records were key learnings to ensuring long-Term access and usability. Finally, the metrics resulting from the project, for example, rates of readable carriers and rates of data recovery by carrier type, are useful data from a point in time that correspond quite closely to similar data recovery projects undertaken by other institutions at about the same time and provide a benchmark for future research. © 2022 Society of American Archivists.

D. Trček,2022,Cultural heritage preservation by using blockchain technologies,"Ubiquitous digitization enables promising options for cultural heritage preservation. Therefore, a new approach is presented that considers deployment scenarios by linking heritage science to tourism. Such an approach is necessary because neither technology nor society views can be treated separately to obtain deployable solutions of a wider social, and even national importance. Clearly, while the traditional approaches to cultural heritage preservation will remain a gold standard, they will be increasingly complemented by digital preservation techniques. Thus, based on practical implementations and lessons learnt in other areas, this multidisciplinary framework paper analyses existing disruptive information technologies deployments. In line with the findings it presents a novel technological architecture tailored to the needs of cultural heritage preservation that deploys an open blockchain architecture. The architecture preserves the advantages of traditional blockchains, which made this technology so important, while enabling energy efficient implementations that can be deployed in mobile applications. By additionally using the contribution-ware principle it links it to tourism, where the identification of users focused incentives and business models play a central role. It is obvious that tourism is a good candidate in such preservation efforts due to the organic links between it and cultural heritage and can support further developments in the heritage preservation domain. © 2022, The Author(s)."
D. Ye,2022,Digital Processing and Storage of Audio Data Based on Tag Information,"With the development of information technology and Internet application, the information on the Internet has exploded. With the continuous advancement of China's digitalization and informatization, all kinds of libraries, museums and archives have successively started the digital preservation and restoration of audio materials in precious historical collections, and the application demand of audio restoration technology is increasing. Along with this, the quantity and information of all kinds of media are becoming more and more numerous, especially audio and video resources. Archives store a large number of audio and video archives of traditional carriers, which are of great value and have a strong demand for utilization. However, with the development of science and technology, the storage carrier, data mode, transmission mode, etc. which these audio and video files depend on are gradually backward and obsolete. In order to effectively help users quickly find the places they are interested in, personalized processing has become one of the research hotspots in recent years. A large number of video, audio and video materials have been accumulated among colleges and universities, many of which are of great historical significance and scientific research value. However, in the face of massive information, what individual users can access is only a drop in the ocean. Driven by this demand, the digital processing and storage of audio data came into being. However, in terms of processing methods, the most common method used in academia is to build a user scoring matrix based on the user's historical check-in data and find similar users for collaborative filtering. However, due to the serious sparsity of the user's check-in data, it is difficult to find similar users, resulting in low accuracy of the stored results. Starting with the method of digital transfer of traditional carrier audio and video files, this paper expounds the audio digital processing and storage algorithm based on label information. © 2022 IEEE."

E. Colloton; J. Farbowitz; C. G. Rodríguez,2022,DISK IMAGING AS A BACKUP TOOL FOR DIGITAL OBJECTS,"This chapter introduces disk imaging as an emerging practice in time-based media art conservation. Disk imaging empowers conservators to interact with digital media in a museum collection while upholding the tenets of contemporary conservation ethics: to implement reversible, documented treatment that does not adversely affect future use or investigation of the original work. A disk image can also act as a “snapshot in time,” documentation of a digital volume’s particular content and functionality at a particular moment. The chapter discusses established factors to consider when selecting a file format for disk images intended for long-term preservation and compare the current formats used by museums, archives, and libraries. Disk imaging software reports the software’s progress and results as a matter of course usually as a sidecar text file. In order to better visualize the disk imaging process, the approach can be conceptualized into three primary stages: pre-imaging, imaging, and post-imaging. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Deena Engel and Joanna Phillips; individual chapters, the contributors."

Nelson,2022,The Rise of GitHub in Scholarly Publications,"The definition of scholarly content has expanded to include the data and source code that contribute to a publication. While major archiving efforts to preserve conventional scholarly content, typically in PDFs (e.g., LOCKSS, CLOCKSS, Portico), are underway, no analogous effort has yet emerged to preserve the data and code referenced in those PDFs, particularly the scholarly code hosted online on Git Hosting Platforms (GHPs). Similarly, the Software Heritage Foundation is working to archive public source code, but there is value in archiving the issue threads, pull requests, and wikis that provide important context to the code while maintaining their original URLs. In current implementations, source code and its ephemera are not preserved, which presents a problem for scholarly projects where reproducibility matters. To understand and quantify the scope of this issue, we analyzed the use of GHP URIs in the arXiv and PMC corpora from January 2007 to December 2021. In total, there were 253,590 URIs to GitHub, SourceForge, Bitbucket, and GitLab repositories across the 2.66 million publications in the corpora. We found that GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket were collectively linked to 160 times in 2007 and 76,746 times in 2021. In 2021, one out of five publications in the arXiv corpus included a URI to GitHub. The complexity of GHPs like GitHub is not amenable to conventional Web archiving techniques. Therefore, the growing use of GHPs in scholarly publications points to an urgent and growing need for dedicated efforts to archive their holdings in order to preserve research code and its scholarly ephemera. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

This is a brief and partial qualitative study. In this regard, we use bibliographical research, document analysis and interviews as methodological strategies. We also seek to outline some concepts such as heritage education, identity, historical document and digital preservation in order to relate the practice of digitizing historical documents to the conservation of documentary and cultural memory. The results point to the absence of specific public policies for the theme in question and the disregard for the local historical heritage (Museu Joaquim Caetano da Silva) that contribute to the consequent delay in scientific and cultural development in the State."
E. Werlang; U. Blattmann,2022,Institutional support by Higher Education Institutions to Editors of Scientific Journals,"Public higher education institutions are responsible for editing most scientific journals in Brazil. Professors of graduate programs voluntarily manage the editorial flow. This article discusses the institutional contributions in financial, human, physical and technological terms received by editors, necessary to comply with good editorial practices. It is an applied research, with exploratory and descriptive purposes, carried out with 95 editors linked to the Brazilian Association of Scientific Editors. The results obtained point out the existing gaps in the institutional support received, mainly regarding the establishment of technical criteria for the selection, permanence and renewal of the editor; to digital preservation; the insufficiency of financial resources for the self-sustainability of the periodicals and even in relation to the formalization of the periodicals with the publishing institutions. The conclusions show that part of the editors' needs are not met due to a question of double responsibility: on the one hand, the editors, who start this activity without training or qualification in the editorial area, which leaves them vulnerable to the very poor weather of the function; on the other hand, the institutions themselves that because they do not have a specific framework for the function, suffer from the same problems of not knowing the institutional support necessary for scientific publishing. © 2022, Escola de Ciencia da Informacao da UFMG.

G. Arrigoni; J. McKim,2022,Experimentation and collecting practice: balancing flexible policies and accountability in developing born-digital museum collections,"This article engages with current approaches to collecting born-digital objects in museums of art and design and reflects on the analysis of two case studies concerned with the respective acquisitions of a virtual reality artwork and a mobile app. The authors point to their non-standard preservation requirements and their unconventional objecthood to advocate for the value of adopting an experimental attitude to collecting. The case studies invite us to reconsider experimentation within the context of sensitive dialogic processes with creators and users who are unfamiliar with the conventions of museum collecting. Hence, the boundaries of experimentations are developed in relation to existing policies, organisational structures and practices, and defined by the stakes of multiple actors. To conclude, the authors argue that collecting institutions should prioritise building capacity and understanding needs and requirements for this emergent type of object, and embrace uncertainty over the imperative of long-term preservation in its fullest sense. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
G. Bequet,2022,Journals preserved or how to turn Diamond into JASPER,"The increase in the number of digital journals has redefined the respective roles of libraries and publishers in the selection, provision and preservation of this content. A new player has emerged, i.e. the archiving agency specializing in long-term digital preservation. Open access journals are poorly preserved, as shown by two recent studies based on an analysis of titles indexed by DOAJ. This worrying finding has motivated DOAJ, CLOCKSS, Keepers Registry, Internet Archive and Public Knowledge Project to join forces to propose an archiving solution for journals without article processing charges. The JASPER project resulted in the creation of a tool and a workflow allowing the preservation of a dozen journals. The next step is to go to scale (more journals archived, more agencies involved), conditioned subject to the mobilization of external funding. © 2022 Gaelle Bequet."
G. Genetasio; E. Merenda; C. Storti,2022,In the mangrove society: a collaborative Legal Deposit management hypothesis for the preservation of and permanent access to the national cultural heritage*,"Legal deposit, regulated by Law no. 106 of 15 April 2004 and Presidential Decree no. 252 of 3 May 2006, requires Italian publishers to deposit a copy of the published material with several libraries. Legal deposit involves long-term preservation and access to information on various media, not least computer networks. While traditional media are well regulated, digital legal deposit rules are barely sketched out. The National Central Library of Florence (BNCF), with the National Central Library of Rome (BNCR) and the Marciana National Library of Venice, created Magazzini digitali: a digital legal deposit project that allows harvesting of doctoral theses and e-journals produced by research institutions, in addition to ebooks and commercial journals. Thanks to a collaboration with Horizons and Giunti, BNCR has started an experimental deposit of ebooks through MLOL. While awaiting the regulation on digital legal deposit, it is urgent to reopen the debate on this issue and make more effective the collaboration between institutions involved in the management of the digital library heritage, so as to establish a coordination structure that will define the scientific guidelines and the appropriate technological and service choices. © 2022, The Author(s)."

Assessing the availability of controlled vocabularies, ontology frameworks, metadata standards, classification schemes and architectural designs, language compatibility for implementing cultural heritage system is inevitable for developing CHIS. The present study examines the availability of such schemes and systems and emphasis the need for developing a reliable information system.Findings A comprehensive system at the country level to efficiently document, manage and update the knowledge on cultural heritage is required. CHIS created can be engaged in visualizing the cultural heritages of the country and can act as an interactive multimedia documentation system. The virtual recreation of cultural heritage in a holistic manner can also ensure its long-term sustainability.Originality/value The digital archive of different expressions will be a rich source of data for research, administration and development. The archive developed should cover the cultural heritage depicted in the form of published documents, images, audios and videos, documents and visuals on performing arts, buildings, sculptures, ecosystem, monuments, utensils, etc. and the history and knowledge pertaining to them and any other property belonging to the heritage."

H. L. Barnes,2022,Digital Curation and Contemporary Documentary Filmmaking,"Documentary films have evolved considerably since 1922s Nanook of the North. Fans of nonfiction now stream multi-episode documentaries on platforms like Netflix or catch a feature at one of many documentary-centered film festivals around the world. Inexpensive video cameras and internet distribution have expanded the documentary film universe exponentially. From 1-min films to feature-length theater releases, moviegoers around the world have embraced this diverse and growing genre. To the benefit of aspiring filmmakers, documentaries can now be filmed on a wide array of digital video devices, including smartphones, and edited inexpensively. Given this abundance, it may seem counterintuitive that, from a preservation perspective, the documentary film genre faces substantial risks. Research indicates that independent filmmakers lack access to resources that would ensure the long-term stewardship of their works (Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 2012). This research project examines documentary film production through the lens of digital curation. It describes filmmakers' data practices and proposes a data curation model designed to guide filmmakers and film archives in developing data management plans similar to those currently used by researchers in the sciences. The proposed data curation model reflects the influence of the growing research data management field and integrates components related to digital storage, copyright, publishing, context, and file organization. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
H. L. Rhee,2022,A New Lifecycle Model Enabling Optimal Digital Curation,"This study recognizes the international need for a broadly applicable lifecycle model to facilitate efficient and systematic digital curation. Consequently, it has developed a generic digital curation lifecycle model, titled the d-KISTI model. This model was developed by applying content analysis and thematic coding to data collected through a two-year review of relevant literature, existing conceptual lifecycle models, and empirical investigations of KISTI’s digital curation practice. It was then refined further through consultations with many international digital curation experts. The d-KISTI model presents actions and their relationships with one another that have gone previously unacknowledged in the DCC curation lifecycle model and other existing curation models. These actions and relationships, which are articulated at length within the study, reflect the rapidly changing nature of the global digital curation landscape and offer more representative curation activities to information organizations. Moreover, through its investigation and analysis of KISTI’s digital curation practices, this study contributes to existing literature on digital curation in Korea. Ultimately, the d-KISTI model seeks to optimize digital curation strategies and practices, both within Korea and internationally, and, moreover, hopes to serve as a foundational touchstone for future studies on digital curation. © The Author(s) 2022."

Odero,2022,The status of the digital preservation policies and plans of the institutional repositories of selected public universities in Kenya,"Institutional repositories (IRs) have a leading role in providing long-term access to the research output of universities. This study assessed the capabilities of institutional repositories in Kenya to support long-term preservation of digital content by reviewing digital preservation policies and plans. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews from 19 respondents drawn from three public universities that were identified by their registration in OpenDOAR, ROARMAP and the number of items in their repositories. Additional data was acquired through analysis of documents such as open access policies and mandates, as well as institutional websites. Findings revealed that the organizations were poorly prepared to support long-term digital preservation. Policies were inadequate and plans to support the implementation of the policies were lacking. The study concluded that although the IRs were to undertake digital preservation, they lacked clearly defined actions from plans and policy. This article offers recommendations, including identifying digital preservation goals that will guide policy formulation and multi-stakeholder involvement in the policy-making process. Effort should also be made to create awareness of the relationship between digital content selection and its successful long-term preservation. © 2022 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved."

One of the methods of making 3D objects is using the photogrammetry method. The photogrammetry method makes 3D objects using many photos captured by the camera that will be integrated into the software and processed into 3D objects. In this research, the framework for modeling 3D objects of the cultural building is proposed based on the photogrammetry approach. This framework includes data capture, modeling and processing, and calibration. This framework was tested while making the 3D object of the Candi Badut temple and reported that the 3D model has significantly had similarities with the real object. The framework is useful for standard guidelines for making 3D modeling of historical relics efficiently. © 2022. International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

However, most engineering drawings exist in the form of scanned PDFs or images, which is inconvenient for data management and storage, especially for table information. Also, many industries are in urgent need of data management software for engineering drawings to improve the degree of digital preservation and management. To this end, a software, ED Manager which is based on the fusion of deep learning and traditional image processing, is presented to detect the position and structure of the table, split and recognize characters, and reconstruct the table in a digital form. Further, we extract crucial information and develop a user interface and database to construct a comprehensive model that fits most engineering drawings. Our software can accurately locate tables for various complex drawings, extract structured information from tables, and build a better data management software for engineering drawings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a quantitative research design for achieving the objectives. The population consisted of undergraduate students from public sector universities (the top five) of Punjab, Pakistan, listed in the Higher Education Commission recognized general universities. The data were analysed by using SmartPLS, mobile self-efficacy was the independent variable that consisted of two constructs (basic mobile phone operations and using the internet and emails). PDA practices was the dependent variable (information backup, clearing and deleting). Findings: The analysis consisted of two major parts: first the assessment of measurement model and second the structural equation modelling analysis. A significant impact of mobile self-efficacy (basic mobile phone operations, using internet and email) was found on all the sub-constructs (information backup, information clearing and information deleting) of PDA practices. However, using internet and email has no significant impact on the information clearing practices of undergraduate students of Pakistani universities. Originality/value: This study is a valuable addition to the extant literature because no comprehensive research has been carried out on the impact of mobile self-efficacy and PDA through mobile phones. It also contributes theoretically in the form of the development of a validated instrument on mobile-based PDA.

Moreover, it is also aimed to develop a model of Personal Digital Archiving process for desktop and ubiquitous devices. This study used Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines for searching and devising, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Search was conducted from selected repositories, databases, and core journals, potentially containing studies related with Personal Digital Archiving. Consequently, 21 studies were included through identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion of studies process. It was found that people used multiple devices such as mobile phones or smartphones along with other devices. It was established that people had also used cloud services with different devices including computers and smartphones or tablets for Personal Digital Archiving. Five major categories of individuals’ Personal Digital Archiving practices, that is, backup, replication or duplication, reorganizing and updating, cleaning or removing, and migration of information were found. Moreover, emotional motives, technological causes, alternative access, easy retrieval, and task completion were the reasons to adopt Personal Digital Archiving. On the basis of findings of selected studies, researchers developed a four steps model of Personal Digital Archiving process, consisting of initiation, identification, action, and evaluation constructs. Personal Digital Archiving challenges were also identified such as the individuals had to face through the use of desktop and ubiquitous devices including technical, fragmented and overloaded information, lack of training and expertise, and psychological and miscellaneous challenges. Personal Digital Archiving process model is based on the extracted data from studies published worldwide, and it is useful for both desktop and ubiquitous devices with reference to Personal Information Management context. The findings of the study will be helpful for software designers and android application developers to design and develop users’ centered Personal Information Management software. © The Author(s) 2021."

Bowern,2022,"Accessibility, Discoverability, and Functionality: An Audit of and Recommendations for Digital Language Archives","While digital archiving has long been standard for linguistics, archives themselves are heterogeneous (Aznar & Seifart 2020), and archived linguistic material is important for researchers and communities, particularly for language reclamation (cf. Baldwin & Olds 2007; Whalen et al. 2016; Hinton 2003, 2018; Kung et al. 2020). The format and usability of scholarly archival collections is shaped by the functions of the management practices at the stewarding institution, making an appreciation of the range of access services provided by such institutions relevant to the evaluation of individual collections. Here we report on a review of 41 digital language archives. Three factors are examined: 1) accessibility, including metadata and site navigation; 2) discoverability, or searchability and internal navigation; and 3) functionality, the overall ease of data retrieval and use. We recognize that the decisions made by both stewards and depositors can greatly impact the accessibility of archived materials; to that end, we present recommendations for how archives might increase the utility of their holdings for their users. We emphasize that our intention is not to dissuade linguists from using archives because of these issues, and we recognize the tremendous amount of work that goes into the upkeep of digital infrastructure, often with very limited institutional support. Implementing such recommendations at an institutional level can establish a fairer peer-review process of archival collections. By delineating precisely what standards fall under the archive management level and what procedures individual depositors are responsible for, the roles of “archivist” and “depositor” become clearer. © 2022 The Author(s)."
J. A. Erima; T. L. Mosweu,2022,"Revamping archival education training in Africa: insights from the Digital Records Curation Study School held in Gaborone, Botswana, 5–9 August 2019","The importance of and need for digital curation has increased significantly in recent years owing to the myriad of risks facing digital assets. These risks include problems of hardware and software obsolescence, media fragility, rapid technological developments and the frequent absence of sufficient metadata. Additionally, digital records face risks of improper handling, corruption and alteration, unauthorized access and accidental erasure. These issues necessitate continuous discussions amongst information professionals, including records managers and archivists, on how best they can be circumvented in the face of changing technologies. Hence, digital curation has gained world-wide acceptance and recognition today as a sound strategy for ensuring the continued accessibility of digital assets. This article discusses the International Council on Archives (ICA) Programme Commission (PCOM) initiative which focuses on capacity building for records and archives management in the African region. In particular, the paper discusses the 2019 Digital Records Curation Programme (DRCP) Study School held in Gaborone, Botswana, which brought together archival educators from various countries across the African continent. The study school provided a forum for the trainers and participants to share knowledge and shape the digital curation agenda for the future, including roll-out of a newly developed digital records curation curriculum for international adoption. This paper recommends the adoption of the DRCP by archival educators in African Universities. It is also recommended that the ICA make provision for continuous professional development training for the trained archival educators. © 2022 Liverpool University Press. All rights reserved."
J. A. Hodges,2022,Transcoding authenticity: preserving unreleased gaming software outside of memory institutions,"Purpose: This paper aims to introduce new criteria for evaluating authenticity in digital preservation, particularly in cases related to unreleased software projects and preservation work that occurs in non-institutional settings. Design/methodology/approach: Interpretive visual and formal analysis of image files is performed on three overlapping preservation efforts to understand the ways that self-appointed preservationists reframe content in varied settings. The unreleased mid-1990s console game Sonic X-Treme is used as a case study because assets from the development process have been widely preserved among former developers and enthusiasts alike. Findings: The findings indicate that non-professional preservationists transcode original production files into a variety of formats, ranging from lossy compressed images to contemporary three-dimensional (3D) modeling files. Materials are presented in settings that range from colorful webpages mimicking the appearance of commercial software to browsable file systems. These results show that non-institutional preservation practices embody notions of authenticity that diverge significantly from those of professional archivists. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its focus on a single case study, but helps to facilitate ongoing research concerning preservation of unreleased projects insofar as it surveys the current status of existing projects. Originality/value: Existing studies within preservation literature have established the need for increased attention paid to unfinished digital works. This study introduces new data and interpretative findings that outline such preservation efforts as they already occur in non-institutional settings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

The paper substantiates the necessity and possibility of measures for the preservation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage by measures of both organisational and technical nature. The international experience of safeguarding cultural heritage by organisational measures and digital preservation is considered; the need to correct this experience in accordance with local specifics is substantiated. The existing technical approaches to the digital preservation of cultural heritage are analysed. An original approach is proposed that most fully simulates complex objects such as artistic reliefs with painting – the method of synchronised laser triangulation, combined with the method of laser-induced break-down spectroscopy. © 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

J. H. Sayarh; A. G. Campbell,2022,Digital Preservation of Experiences in Virtual Worlds: Extending Digital Rights to Include Right to Replay,"Experiences within Virtual Worlds spaces are increasingly becoming normalised as the standard form of human interaction, not only for play but also for work and education. The COVID pandemic did not cause this, but because of this existential crisis and Climate change, the development of virtual worlds is speeding up. Their role in society is changing, and they are becoming just as important as real-world spaces. Still, due to their digital nature, they are inherently ephemeral, they only exist for a short time in software and hardware. Then, they are simply lost to the ether. These worlds and the experiences of the users within them needs to be preserved. For digital preservation of these virtual worlds to succeed, a new approach is necessary, based not on preserving the world’s data but on the players’ experiences within. A user-centric approach to the digital preservation of our experiences in Virtual Worlds virtual reality experiences is required. This can be achieved by extending our digital rights to include our right to replay. When codifying the right to allow for replaying experiences within virtual worlds, it can be argued that this action is burdening the companies who create those virtual worlds with undue responsibilities. This paper outlines how such a burden is trivial given modern-day game engines. To demonstrate this fact, an open-source library was developed to record generic objects within a Virtual World. This approach differs from others that approach treating the virtual world as a deterministic environment. The system in this paper records an object position and interactions within a world instead of just the raw inputs that most replay systems use. This article aims to discuss how future technology generating these worlds should target replays systems as a digital preservation method. Other more laborious processes will not be achieved even if they are enshrined into law. This approach hopes to offer to balance the burden between user and producer of virtual worlds. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."
J. Jacobson; C. Z. Lin; R. McEwen,2022,Information behaviour paradox: Understanding perceptions of risk and online behaviour,"Human behaviour is complex and demographics are insufficient to understand information behaviour. More nuanced analyses are required to understand the factors that drive action. Focusing on digital archiving and online protection strategies as manifestations of information behaviour, factors that influence perceptions of online risk were investigated. The relationship between perception and behaviour was analyzed by focusing on people's risk responses and their archival habits. Using Bates’ theory of Information Behaviour, information behaviour paradoxes, what people do versus what they say they would do in online situations, were analyzed. By applying a mixed-method approach to 101 semi-structured interviews, individuals’ self-perceived internet skills and having a third-party negative experience are two key factors that influence perceptions of risk online. A three-part typology of internet users (cautiously optimistic offliners, confident onliners, and utopic onliners) is introduced. Perceptions of online risk have consequences for information behaviour and informs a theoretical modification. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
J. M. Barrueco; M. Termens,2022,Digital preservation in institutional repositories: a systematic literature review,"Purpose: This paper aims to carry out a literature review on the implementation of digital preservation policies, strategies and actions by institutional repositories. The objective is to identify, out of the published experiences, at which level they are fulfilling the function of ensuring the long-term availability of the deposited materials. Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic literature review methodology, a total of 21 articles from international refereed journals published between 2009 and 2020 are reviewed. Findings: The research production on this subject is very limited. The scarce number of published articles proves that the interest of repository managers has been focused on issues other than to assure the long-term availability of the assets they store. The literature review has not found clear evidence about how institutional repositories are implementing digital preservation. It is particularly striking the lack of works focused on the situation in European countries. More field studies are needed. They would allow to extract conclusions and produce best practices to help managers to improve preservation strategies. Originality/value: This study has shown that one of the main functions of repositories is not being dealt with as promised by repository managers. More work in this area is needed. In particular, it is necessary for a study at the European level to gather detailed data that will allow to draw a portrait of the current situation, extract conclusions and produce best practices to help managers to improve or develop preservation strategies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Amezquita-Becerra,2022,Automation Tool for Institutional Repositories Evaluation,"The rise of digital repositories has framed a significant advance in access to academic and scientific knowledge, increasing its impact due to greater reach and lower cost. However, these platforms are a new topic that initially did not have standards or models to carry out their implementation and operation, which is why there were inconsistencies between repositories on issues such as interoperability, digital preservation, among others. Due to the lack of standardization and the exponential increase in the number of repositories, different organizations and researchers made multiple proposals to standardize the processes and characteristics of these platforms. The proposals materialized in models, such as the Dublin Core and DataCite metadata schemes, and in guides for the evaluation and implementation of repositories, such as the Guide for the evaluation of institutional research repositories"" by RECOLECTA or the DINI certificate (Deutsche Initiative fur Netzwerk Information). The latter aim to evaluate the platforms in their entirety, including 8 sections with a total of 87 elements. Therefore, in this research an application was developed to automate the evaluation of repositories, automating processes that improve educational work using computer tools and their integration."""
K. Kim,2022,Thoughts on the long-term digital preservation of scholarly journals,"Online publishing has become a dominant trend in the publishing of scientific, technical, and medical (STM) journals. Almost all STM journals already publish online, and the proportion of those that publish online-only is increasing rapidly. Online publishing obviously requires a completely different approach to preserving journal content. All storage devices are based on magnetic phenomena and are governed by the laws of physics. Stored digital information can spontaneously become erroneous or corrupted over time, and this problem can be worsened when the ambient magnetic field is stronger and the temperature is higher. Therefore, digital information needs to be carefully stored in an environment where the temperature and the ambient magnetic field are well-controlled and must be backed up periodically. Many difficult technical problems are also associated with managing complex file structures and formats as a database grows. These tasks require considerable effort and expenses. Thus, it seems natural to ask whether journal publishers or the institutions that keep their digital materials have sustainable plans and resources to preserve journals for a long period of time © 2022.

Marciano,2022,"Using AI and ML to optimize information discovery in under-utilized, Holocaust-related records","Digital cultural assets are often thought to exist in separate spheres based on their two principal points of origin: digitized and born digital. Increasingly, advances in digital curation are blurring this dichotomy, by introducing so-called “collections as data,” which regardless of their origination make cultural assets more amenable to the application of new computational tools and methodologies. This paper brings together archivists, scholars, and technologists to demonstrate computational treatments of digital cultural assets using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques that can help unlock hard-to-reach archival content. It describes an extended, iterative study applied to digitized and datafied WWII-era records housed at the FDR Presidential Library, rich content that is regrettably under-utilized by scholars examining American responses to the Holocaust. Authors detail the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration for evaluating user needs, identifying and applying tools and methodologies (including ML through object detection and AI through Named Entity Recognition or NER), and reaching the real-world outcome of public access to augmented data. They also discuss issues of digital representation, relational context, and interface design to enable new modes of public and scholarly access. While based on a case study, we believe that this work is a substantial contribution to revealing the strengths and weaknesses of using AI/ML systems in cultural organizations. We give particular care to lessons learned, and generalize the approach taken across broad classes of collections with a focus on responsive iterations, reproducibility, and the relevance of data and its structures to users. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply."
K. Thomer Andrea; R. Starks Joseph; R. Alexandria; C. Lenard Michael,2022,"Maintaining Repositories, Databases, and Digital Collections in Memory Institutions: An Integrative Review","Database maintenance and migration are critical but under-supported activities in libraries, archives, museums (LAMs), and other scholarly spaces. Existing guidelines for digital curation rarely account for the maintenance needed to keep digital curation infrastructures functioning over time. Though many case studies have been published describing individual instances of migration, there has been little generalizable research done in this area. Thus, it is challenging to understand overall trends or best practices in this space. We bridge this gap by conducting an integrative literature review of papers describing database migrations and maintenance in LAMs and other scholarly contexts. By qualitatively coding 75 articles from 58 publication venues, we identify common motivations for database migrations and maintenance actions. We find that databases are migrated to support changing user needs as well as to ward off technological obsolescence; we also find that common challenges include schema crosswalking and a need for data cleaning. Practitioners describe community collaboration as key in surmounting these challenges. Through this integrative review, we build a base for further best practices development and identify a need to better model database curation as part of the digital curation lifecycle.

L. A. O’Hagan,2022,Breaking the “Class” Ceiling: The Challenges and Opportunities of Creating a Digital Archive of Edwardian Working-Class Book Inscriptions,"Book inscriptions are an important example of “ordinary writing” that have the potential to reshape current understandings of working-class life in Edwardian Britain (1901-1914). Nonetheless, due to historical bias in collection policies and the perceived value of working-class writing, books containing these marks tend to survive largely outside of official institutions of power. Furthermore, when examples exist in libraries and archives, they tend to be scant and undocumented and, thus, are difficult to find. Without some form of intervention, these inscriptions face endangerment and entire narratives of working-class culture and history risk being eradicated. Digital preservation offers an important way to safeguard these inscriptions and make them available on a large scale. However, there are a number of challenges that prevent or hinder the possibility. This paper explores some of these difficulties and suggests ways in which they can be overcome in order to give a permanent voice to the voiceless and break the “class” ceiling. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022, corrected publication 2023."
L. Čelofiga; M. Novak; V. Skitek,2022,Method of Archival Records Appraisal Based on Reference Values-Example of Pedagogical Documentation at the Brezno-Podvelka Elementary School,"At the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022, an archival professional question arose at Brezno-Podvelka Elementary School regarding the further storage of e-diaries and e-grade books. In accordance with the existing archival practice in the physical environment, only samples of this documentation should transferred the competent archives. The rest of this documentation should be destroyed by the creator. The established approach objectively represents a long-term risk in the electronic environment, which we define as the systematic establishment of inequality in the use of public archival records. To manage this risk, the authors developed a benchmark appraisal method. The method should be widely applicable for the appraisal of other types of archival records, data, information, contexts, etc. For the purposes of this paper, the authors performed an analysis of the system support and the creation of digital forms of pedagogical documentation. The procedures and the technical environment for the creation of e-diaries and e-grade books at Brezno-Podvelka Elementary School were analysed. At the same time, the current practice of managing e-diaries and e-grade books by the creator and the necessary legislation in the subject area was reviewed. On this basis, an appraisal model was developed together with value scales that take into account reference entities in electronic environments for the purposes of ensuring public trust for these documents. Based on the legally compliant creation of records and their long-term preservation at Brezno-Podvelka Elementary School, the method for the appraisal of electronic archival records was developed. This method takes into account the existing principles and criteria for the appraisal of pedagogical documentation with regards to technical and technological aspects. In this context, the authors point out the importance of reference values of appraisal entities as key to achieving the goals of the comprehensive appraisal in archival theory and practice. With the research, the authors want to encourage a wider archival professional discussion about new approaches and considerations regarding professional activities on digital archival contents. In doing so, archivist must follow several goals, including the provision of public faith not only based on technical, but also from the aspect of contents and references, including needed relations. Brezno-Podvelka Elementary School has adopted internal rules for pedagogical documentation and uses a legally compliant information platform. From this point of view this is an example of good practice in the field of modern records management. E-diaries and e-grade books enable the development and testing of various methods or procedures for managing electronic archival records and other resources both at the creator, as well as at the storage service provider and, last but not least, at the competent archives. All this enables the competent archives not only the testing and developing content appraisal methods, but also other methods and procedures for long-term management of archival entities. © 2022, Maribor Provincial Archives.

L. K. Morreale,2022,HISTORY AS ANTIDOTE: THE ARGUMENT FOR DOCUMENTATION IN DIGITAL HISTORY,"The ephemeral nature of computer-enabled historical work is a well-documented concern within the field of history. The quick pace of technological change often renders digital scholarship obsolete, which in turn encourages historians to retreat to the stable and durable comfort of print, even as digital methodologies enrich our research and expand the audience for it. What has been missing so far in the conversation about digital history is a clear understanding of how it differs from traditional historical products, what can be gained from it, and how we might document the work undertaken using these machine-based methodologies. Because it is best understood as a process rather than as a product, digital history must have a history of its own to tether it to the scholarly community and to ensure that it endures past the active phase of any project. This article argues that digital historians should catalog their work using a normalized template following the Digital Documentation Process, a guide for producing documentation that is suitable for computer-based historical scholarship and tailored to its specific parameters. Self-documentation is beneficial to those who create digital history and those who consume it. It is urgent to establish a field-wide expectation that digital history will be consistently documented as a matter of course, lest we lose scholarship that has already been produced and forgo the enormous opportunities that computer-enabled methodologies offer to historians. © 2022 Wesleyan University."
L. Talboom; M. Bell,2022,Keeping it under lock and keywords: exploring new ways to open up the web archives with notebooks,"The UK Government Web Archive (UKGWA) has been archiving government websites since 1996 and now holds regular snapshots of over 5000 sites. Currently, this material can be accessed through browsing or a simple keyword search interface on their website and has also been catalogued in The National Archives’ online catalogue, Discovery. However, the scale of the UKGWA exposes the limits of the current search interface, and there is no facility to understand the archive in aggregate. This article seeks to go beyond the simple keyword search by exploring the data sources available, from APIs to web crawling, for computational analysis of the UKGWA. The article is accompanied by two Python Notebooks which present examples of analysis using each data source. Notebooks lower the technical barriers for the reader to explore and interpret the UKGWA as data, while surfacing the challenges around making web material computationally accessible. © 2022, The Author(s)."
M. A. Awamleh; F. Hamad,2022,Digital preservation of information sources at academic libraries in Jordan: an employee’s perspective,"Purpose: Digital preservation requires new skills and collaboration among library staff to maintain long-term access to information resources. Digital content and digital technologies pose a serious challenge to information institutions to continue to select, preserve and access information resources. However, there is an urgent need to increase awareness of the new trends in the partnership between research communities and academic libraries; there is also a need for new digital preservation-related skills among librarians. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the benefits, importance, requirements and challenges of digital preservation in academic libraries in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was disseminated to 150 library staff working at the 10 public universities in Jordan, with 133 questionnaires suitable to analyze with a response rate of (88.6%). Findings: The results indicate a moderate perception of the benefits and importance of digital preservation, as well as the requirements and challenges in academic libraries in Jordan to carry out the digital preservation process. This indicated the importance of increasing the academic libraries' – specifically academic libraries in Jordan – awareness of the vast and important benefits of digital preservation to maintain long-term access to information. It was noted that factors such as sex, experience, educational level and specialization did not affect the results. Practical implications: The findings will provide insights for other academic libraries on how to plan and develop preservation policies to maintain access to information. Social implications: Access to information is a human right that contributes to the advocacy of sustainable development, and hence, digital preservation can facilitate long-term availability and accessibility to information. Originality/value: This paper provides insights and practical solutions for academic libraries in response to technological development and the change requirements. It will help academic libraries handle and cope with the challenges of providing distance library services over digital channels. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Triviño-Tarradas,2022,"Historical-graphical analysis and digital preservation of cultural heritage: case study of the baptismal font of the church of Santiago Apóstol in Montilla (Córdoba, Spain)","Stone is a characteristic element in the construction of buildings and monuments in the Middle Ages in Spain. This is so mainly due to its durability and, in baptismal fonts, specifically, its symbolism: Jesus Christ is the cornerstone, he comes to save us and is the foundation of the life of the Christian and of the Universal Church. The application of virtual 3D reconstruction is essential in the conservation of this type of heritage, together with scientific techniques and methods, and the analysis of historical-graphic documentation. Focusing on these three aspects, the baptismal font of the church of Santiago Apóstol de Montilla will be taken as a reference. The baptismal font of the church of Santiago Apóstol in Montilla (Córdoba, Spain), whose exact origin is unknown, is one of the most important heritage assets. San Francisco Solano, known as the “Thaumaturge of the New World”, was baptised in it. For over four centuries, the temple has been the Main Church of the head of the Marquisate of Priego. This study aims to know, document and carry out a digital reconstruction of an important piece of the monumental heritage of the Catholic Church: the baptismal font of the church of Santiago Apóstol in Montilla. To this end, we searched a major literature review focused on the use of photogrammetry for reading old graphics and deciphering texts. After that we analysed the graphic documentation derived from the restoration process conducted by Cordovan restorer Vázquez Arjona in the late twentieth century. The application of 3D digitisation and documentation techniques has allowed not only to analyse this important heritage element in detail through a virtual reconstruction, but also to make a far-reaching discovery regarding one of its elements, the unknown inserted inscription in the baptismal font band. © 2022, The Author(s)."
M.

M. E. Matlala; T. R. Ncube; S. Parbanath,2022,The state of digital records preservation in South Africa’s public sector in the 21st century: a literature review,"Purpose: This study aims to assess the status of the digital records preservation practices in the South African public sector at the national department level. It set out to establish to what extent digital preservation policies have been implemented in South Africa’s public sector, to determine the related skills and competency of public sector staff, and to make any necessary recommendations of the basis of the results. Design/methodology/approach: A content review of Southern Africa literature dealing with the preservation of digital records, its importance and related factors over the past 20 years was conducted. Findings: The current state of preservation of South African digital records suggests serious consequences of existing knowledge and training gaps. Addressing those gaps may provide the knowledge needed to support new ways of working. Records management professionals in the South African public sector at the national department level are currently ill-equipped to adequately preserve digital records. This complicates the application of tools offered by the information and communication technologies that have resulted in increased creation of digital records. Research limitations/implications: The study was limited to only the public sector of South Africa. Practical implications: The study makes practical implications concerning the policy framework for improving the state of digital preservation in South Africa so as to ensure long-term preservation of digital records. For instance, government departments are recommended to formulate and implement in-house policy frameworks, guidelines and plans that address digital preservation of records. Social implications: Sufficient funding and resource allocation ought to be provided to advance electronic records management programmes. In addition, the formulation of proper strategies needed to preserve digital records should incorporate technological tools and media software in the existing operations for the creation, capturing, appraising and preserving of digital records. Originality/value: This study offers informed recommendations to address the challenges of preserving digital records in South Africa so that future losses may be avoided and allow readers to see changes over the 20-year period. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Underdown,2022,Safeguarding the Nation’s Digital Memory: Bayesian Network Modelling of Digital Preservation Risks,"Archives comprise primary sources which may be physical, born digital or digitised. Digital records have a limited lifespan, through carrier degradation, software and hardware obsolescence and storage frailties. It is important that the original bitstream of these primary sources is preserved and can be demonstrated to have been preserved. Soft elicitation with experienced archivists was used to identify the most likely elements contributing to digital preservation success and failure and the relationships between these elements. A Bayesian Network representation of an integrating decision support system provided a compact representation of reality, enabling the risk scores for various scenarios to be compared using a linear utility function. Thus, the effect on risk of various actions and interventions can be quantified. This tool, DiAGRAM, is now in use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
M. M. Rahman; K. Shirahada,2022,Value Proposition Framework in Digital Archive Management System,"Although digital archives ensure long-term preservation and wider access to important historical, cultural, and administrative evidence as primary sources of information, existing archive management system cannot contribute to education and research as expected. The basic reason is lack of cooperation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing practice among stakeholders, users, and archive staffs. Accordingly, this research aims to develop a value proposition framework integrating different archival service entities. Therefore, this study reviewed literature and analyzed primary data collected from person in-charge of 68 local archive centers of Japan. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS and SmartPLS. Result shows that archival value co-creation is associated with stakeholders' involvement, staff's motivation, users' participation, and organizational effectiveness. Each component has different essence in archival value co-creation. Considering the essence, the study proposed a conceptual archival value proposition framework for promoting archival value. The proposed framework can ensure wider access for users, generate new ideas for archive centers, and accurate management for stakeholders. © 2022 PICMET."

This paper presents preliminary findings of the larger study which aimed to determine the strategies for research data management (RDM) at selected universities in KwaZulu-Natal. The current study used the community capability maturity model framework (CCMF) and the digital curation centre (DCC) lifecycle model as theoretical support to determine the strategies for RDM service provision with specific reference to the University of Zululand. The interpretive paradigm, following the qualitative research approach through a single case study, was used. Primary data was gathered through online interviews using Zoom and Teams with Librarians, Technicians, HODs, and DVC Research due to the Covid-19 pandemic and availability of technologies. The findings of the study revealed the University of Zululand does not have an RDM policy; however, research activities are practiced. The University lacks the infrastructure and investment to support RDM services and activities. The study is significant for providing the background for developing RDM in the public university through RDM strategy and policy. The findings also sought to inform the university's RDM agenda."

M. Ngoepe; L. Jacobs; M. Mojapelo,2022,Inclusion of digital records in the archives and records management curricula in a comprehensive open distance e-learning environment,"Recent developments in the knowledge economy impact on the archival profession globally. Key components of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), such as blockchain technology and artificial intelligence are influencing the manner and context in which digital records in organisations are managed. This has necessitated the University of South Africa, a comprehensive open distance e-learning institution (CODeL), through the Department of Information Science, to evaluate and recurriculate its postgraduate programme in archives and records management. The key aim of this recurriculation was to ensure alignment with international trends and practices in digital records management practices. The revised programme offers graduates an opportunity to keep abreast with various technological and digital records discipline-related developments with reference to knowledge and information governance, data curatorship and management, as well as archival diplomatics and digital records forensics. This qualitative study used literature review, as well as personal experiences to explore the revision of an archives and records management curriculum in a CODeL environment to make it relevant to technological transformations unique to the 4IR. In our analysis, we recommend the inclusion of computational archival science in the responsive curriculum, to enable graduates to acquire skills in the application of technological tools, methods and resources pertaining to digital records processing, analysis, storage, long-term preservation, and access. The focus of the recurriculation was to improve the efficiency, productivity, and precision in support of appraisal, arrangement and description, preservation, and access towards enhanced digital records management practices. The study also reports on the framework for team approach in the development of the programme, as well as elements of transformation to reflect Africanisation in the curriculum. © The Author(s) 2022."

The context of this work is outlined including the history of Ireland’s national library, its role, resources and place in library, archive, cultural and digital preservation networks. The development of the NLI Web Archive is discussed within the wider context of the Library’s mission and digital collecting and preservation policies, as well as international approaches to preserving the web. The article looks at how the NLI has developed its selective web archive over the past decade, and has grown the content and access to it as a way to mitigate against the absence of at-scale solutions. The unusual legal context in Ireland regarding legislative barriers to archiving the Irish web space at scale and the NLI’s work for over a decade to change this situation are discussed as are the significant implications of the current legal situation for data loss and long-term access to Ireland’s contemporary record. Distinctive Irish aspects of digital cultural heritage preserved in the NLI Web Archive collections are highlighted. The opportunities and challenges in developing outreach and access for the Web Archive are considered together with its relationship with the collecting activities of the Library’s Born Digital Pilot Projects. This article will also discuss types of usage and user groups in relation to archived Irish web data. Potential for creative and imaginative uses of Irish web archive collections and data are also considered in relation to the Library’s broader public learning and outreach programmes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."

The DKRZ (German Climate Computing Center; German: Deutsches Klimarechenzentrum) is the only remaining DDC Partner from the original group jointly managing the DDC. In spite of changes in prioritization, it has been supporting the IPCC Assessments and preserving the quality-assured, citable climate model data underpinning the Assessment Reports over these years over the long term. An active and engaged collaborative community achieved advances in data standardization, data management best practices, and infrastructure developments. These evolving standards are reflected in the activities of the DDC. The introduction of the IPCC FAIR Guidelines into the current Sixth IPCC Assessment Report (AR6) has significantly changed the role of the DDC Partner DKRZ from an independent partner for long-term data preservation into an active partner involved in the IPCC's Sixth Assessment cycle. As a result, the DDC has gained exposure and visibility, posing a challenge and an opportunity to operationalize the IPCC's FAIR Guidelines and long-term preservation approaches. While the value of DDC services has been recognized, DDC sustainability remains unresolved and is currently being discussed within the IPCC as part of a general AR6 review process to formulate recommendations for the AR7 data management."

Spagnuolo,2022,Ensuring the Long-Term Preservation of and Access to the Italian Federated Electronic Health Record,"The Italian Electronic Health Record (called the FSE) is based on a federated architectural model and involves various types of health data and documents deriving from public and private health stakeholders. Clinical documents are stored in repositories and indexed in a central regional index (registry) according to a defined metadata schema. The FSE repositories can be distributed in the regional network or centralized at the regional level, or regions can use subsidiarity services offered by the National Infrastructure for the regional FSEs Interoperability. In this scenario, this study addresses the open issue of the FSE documents’ long-term preservation and access over time, since the responsibility of their preservation is distributed among different stakeholders. As a consequence, the process traceability is necessary to ensure that a document indexed in an FSE is accessible over time, regardless of the document local discard policies applied for legal fulfilments. The results of this study show that the enhancement of metadata use could support the management and long-term preservation of the FSE documents. Addressing this issue is, finally, fundamental to guarantee the correct tracing and access to the clinical path of a patient and to ensure the efficiency of the entire care setting. © 2022 by the authors.

Collection stewards begin the process of digital preservation by investigating the past or history of data in their possession, documenting that information to make certain it is available to future users indefinitely. This background information creates context and makes data more meaningful, helping future users understand how a file was created, how it was used, and who used it. Preservationists also document information about the file in its present state.

This work is part of Anti-Amnesia, a project which aims to investigate Design as an agent for the regeneration and reinvention, narratives and materials, of disappearing Portuguese cultures and manufacturing techniques. In general, this project aims to: develop methodologies, through digital means and tools, that contribute to the preservation of the heritage and cultural heritage of the craft industries; contribute to the sustainability of the craft heritage, through the revitalization of the tradition of these industries, ensuring a continuous transmission of skills, techniques and craft knowledge to future generations; and promote research and research in this area of Portuguese manufacturing. Specifically, in this work to create the platform, we seek, through digital technology, to make information more accessible and universal, facilitating access to knowledge. Through the platform, and with the support of educational tools and services, we will seek to promote the learning of Portuguese manufacturing techniques, in order to attract young people to recover older practices. Based on this strategy, it is intended to value tradition, preserve it, and transmit it to future generations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
N. Moles,2022,Preservation for diverse users: digital preservation and the “Designated Community” at the Ontario Jewish Archives,"Purpose: Conventional approaches to digital preservation posit that archives should define a Designated Community, or future user group, for whom they preserve digital information. Archivists can then use their knowledge of these users as a reference to help them deliver digital information that is intelligible and usable. However, this approach is challenging for archives with mandates to serve wide and diverse audiences; these archives risk undermining their efforts by focusing on the interests of a narrow user group. Design/methodology/approach: A unique approach to this challenge was developed in the context of a project to build a digital preservation program at the Ontario Jewish Archives (OJA). It draws from previous research on this topic and is based on a combination of practical and theoretical considerations. Findings: The approach described here replaces the reference of a Designated Community with three core components: a re-articulation of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) mandatory responsibilities; the identification of three distinct tiers of access for digital records; and the implementation of an access portal that allows digital records to be accessed and rendered online. Together with supplemental shifts in reference points, they provide an alternative to the concept of a Designated Community in the determination of preservation requirements, the identification of significant properties, the creation of Representation Information and in the evaluation of success. Originality/value: This article contributes a novel approach to the ongoing conversation about the Designated Community in digital preservation, its application and its limitations in an archival context. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

N. R. Zahara; T. A. Salim,2022,Preservation of Digital Archives: Systematic Literature Review,"Background of the study: Digital archives in institutions or organizations has increased which is marked by the number of institutions that have established archive units. In the process of preservation or preservation of digital archives, it has its own difficulties compared to other media. Preservation is the most strategic activity, because the availability of records is closely related to the acquisition results that are maintained properly so that they can be processed and accessed for users. The implementation of archive preservation is not easy, there are several obstacles that cause the preservation to be less than optimal. Purpose: This study aims to provide knowledge about the preservation of digital archives as an effort to save important information and data in archives, it requires preservation or preserving archives in digital format. So that further research is needed, so this research is to facilitate researchers in conducting further research. Method: This study uses a systematic literature review method by combining bibliometric analysis of the literature from the Scopus database for the period 2018 to 2022. Findings: The results of the study show that preservation is an effort to maintain and store archives, both content or media so that they are durable and longer. Conclusion: Research topics in the search results regarding the preservation of digital archives are still found that have not been widely studied, namely, data preservation, long-term preservation, digital archives, and web archives, which can provide opportunities for further researchers to examine digital archive preservation. © 2022, Airlangga University Faculty of Vocational Studies.

Ying,2022,A Metric Instrument for the Games with Cultural Heritage,"This paper reviews existing research within two fields; game studies and cultural heritage, discovering inadequacies in current digital means of cultural heritage preservation. It is not unheard of that commercial games have been utilized to showcase them, but they tend to get glossed over in favor of serious games. Therefore, this study details two new tools that can further identify and assess the level of cultural heritage content in commercial games which will benefit not just their digital preservation, but also game developers and game design researchers. A unique conceptual framework was developed for analysing video game content specifically on four elements of cultural heritage and five elements of game components in both tangible and intangible forms. Exploratory tables of metrics were also created to quantify said content with the help of the existing Goal Question and Metric (GQM) table. They were then put to the test in two trials; Experiment I analysing 6 game franchises and Experiment II testing 28 games. Both demonstrated the presence of significant amounts of cultural heritage, much more than past works credited. Further research into this area, including adapting said tools for other game studies and commercial games usage will be possible and fruitful. © 2022, Serious Games Society. All rights reserved."
O. Reistad; A. Glaser; R. D. Frank; S. H. Kaald,2022,Document-Based Nuclear Archaeology,"Deeper reductions in the nuclear arsenals will require better understanding of historic fissile material management and production. The concept of “nuclear archaeology” has been considered since the 1990s to provide the tools and methods to develop independent production estimates, primarily based on nuclear forensic techniques. Here, we propose to add a framework for reconstructing the history of a nuclear program that complements traditional nuclear archaeology techniques by examining the role of operating records to support such an effort. As a test case, we use the JEEP II reactor, a 2 MW civilian research reactor at Norway’s Institute for Energy Technology (IFE), in operation for more than fifty years, however, recently shut down permanently. We have collected, analyzed, and started to preserve the reactor’s operating records, which exist on both analog and digital media, and to simulate parts of its history using OpenMC/ONIX neutronics calculations. A particular focus of this project has been on digital data curation and preservation to confirm and maintain the integrity, authenticity, and provenance of these records. In developing guidelines for best practices that conform to existing standards for long-term digital preservation and curation, we hope this project can help lay the basis for future nuclear archaeology efforts to support nuclear arms control and disarmament. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
P. Colpaert,2022,Building materializable querying interfaces with the TREE hypermedia specification,"Ever since the Web was introduced to access representations of resources via URLs, Web developers have been coming up with ways to make available more specific HTTP responses via more complex URL patterns. Complex URL patterns with features such as the SPARQL query language, GraphQL, OGC Web Feature Services, or free text queries, also come with limitations: i) you can only query the data integrated on the machine you query, ii) coding against a fixed protocol lowers potential evolvability, iii) relying on dynamic server functionality raises challenges in long-term preservation, and iv) sending the full query to a third party server lowers query privacy. Linked Data Fragments puts forward the idea that there is a false dichotomy between solving the full query on the server of the data publisher and solving it fully on the infrastructure of the consumers: when publishing data in fragments of triples in a dataset with a certain locality into an interlinked resource-structure, data consumers can speed up their own query processing. In this paper, we build evolvable and preservable Web APIs using “materializable interfaces” with the TREE hypermedia specification. For use cases such as route planning, full-text search, geospatial look-ups or replication and synchronization, we show how to build a fragmentation by qualifying the relation from one fragment to another. This way, the TREE hypermedia specification helps to overcome the four drawbacks of URL-based query protocols. The specification will be further developed as part of a W3C community group for which we are now seeking support. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

P. G. Weston,2022,Should catalogues wade in open water?,"In recent years, libraries, either on their own or in consortia, have carried out digitisation projects which resulted in establishing criteria to make digital items accessible through the catalogue. Pushing the boundaries of the latter, cataloguers have considered the possibility of providing access to the digital version of a work whenever available in the public domain. Librarians have now started to question whether the catalogue, moving past the idea of being just a citational tool, should open itself to the web as the place where users, thanks to quality data, can gain easy access to freely available digital bibliographic material. This should include digital publishing, as well as DH projects, all of which are based on editions published in printed format. This scenario urges to find quick policy answers: a. how should features which could act as search keys or filters be adequately described; b. how should flexibility and changeability of digital objects be dealt with; c. how traditional cataloguing procedures should change as a consequence of the number and the peculiarities of these items; d. which criteria should be adopted in marking the new border lines of the library / catalogue mission. © 2022, The Author(s)."
P. O'Grady; D. L. Minick; D. O. Stueber,2022,"Making Up for the Past How the Oregon Archaeological Society Addresses Its Collector"" Origins""","In 2015, the Oregon Archaeological Society (OAS) presented statements to Oregon tribes and the Oregon Legislative Commission on Indian Services acknowledging the troubling history of OAS collecting activities and steps taken to transform the OAS, and sought guidance to address continuing tribal concerns. Tribes encouraged both the return of collections and increased public outreach efforts. Their guidance fueled increased effort by the Collection Recovery Committee (OASCRC), which has facilitated the return of five collections to tribal museums and university curation facilities and coordinated digital preservation of documents. The OAS may be the only avocational society in the United States actively engaged in such efforts, accomplished by a small group of volunteers. Case studies of collections, considerations involved in disposition, and the potential for repatriation and research are highlighted. The OAS seeks to halt dispersal and commodification of cultural objects and encourage academic research. Quick action can assure that the original collectors or descendants provide key site and location information. Educational opportunities can be rendered to the heritage community, and we are uniquely positioned to contribute to that service."
P. Patlakas; M. Musso; P. Larkham,2022,A digital curation model for post-occupancy evaluation data,"Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) is an important component of a cyclical design process that allows cost savings and promotes accountability of designers, owners, and users, as well as allowing identification of facilities issues and informed decision-making. It is reasonable to expect that the combined effect of new data-gathering technologies and the increasing urgency of sustainable building design will be that POE studies will increase and, eventually, be applied at a mass scale. Digital Curation (DC) allows for the long-term preservation and constant re-use of research data. Yet there has been no attempt so far to develop a DC strategy for POE data. This paper introduces the concept of Digital Curation and relates it to objective, quantitative POE data. A combination of a literature review and a questionnaire sent to expert respondents is utilised in order to identify data types and major Digital Curation issues relevant to POE. A Digital Curation Model (DCM) for POE data is presented, drawing from the existing models, examples, and best practice available, intended to act as a framework that enables the storage, archiving, management, recovery and utilisation of such data on a mass scale. Finally, the importance, benefits, obstacles and implications of developing a suitable DC strategy for Post-Occupancy Evaluation are discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
R. Ahmad; M. Rafiq,2022,Assessing the preparedness of university libraries for digital preservation,"This study was carried out to assess the preparedness of libraries for digital preservation programs in terms of the availability of financial, technological, human resources, and policies and procedures. The sampling frame comprised of central libraries of 70 public sector universities and DAIs established till 2010. Out of the 70 targeted institutions, 63 participated in the survey with a response rate of 90%. Due to a lack of normality in the data, non-parametric tests (Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis H) were applied for exploring significant differences and variances between different groups. Overall, a passive level of preparedness was observed for digital preservation in these libraries. A lower level of preparedness was noted in terms of policies and procedures related to digital preservation (M = 1.79, SD = 1.039), training opportunities (M = 1.98, SD = 0.944), and skilled human resources (M = 2.07, SD = 1.110). The availability of funds for acquisition of technological infrastructure (M = 2.59, SD = 1.364) was the only area where libraries had a good level of preparedness. Libraries of Islamabad Capital Territory and the Punjab province showed better preparedness than libraries in other parts of the country. The study has theoretical implications for researchers and practical implications for university libraries, higher education administrative bodies, and university and library administrators. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

R. Bettivia; Y. Y. Cheng; M. R. Gryk,2022,Introduction to PREMIS,"This chapter covers PREMIS basics including its creation and its version history up until its current iteration, version 3.0. PREMIS was designed to mirror the dominant standard in digital preservation, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS). In recent years, it has made moves towards compatibility with Semantic Web environments with an OWL-ontology and a less linear information model. This chapter explores the four main functional entities in PREMIS: objects, events, agents, and rights. It also covers the ways version 3.0 describes relationships between entities. Finally, it contains a series of related mini-exercises that will enable a reader to create a simple PREMIS record. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

R. Bettivia; Y. Y. Cheng; M. R. Gryk,2022,Workflow Provenance with PREMIS,"In much the same way that ProvONE extends PROV beyond its original boundaries to address the full temporal spectrum of provenance, this chapter takes PREMIS beyond its home in digital preservation. We explore a real-world application of PREMIS in the scientific domain of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using a tool called Workflow Builder. In contrast to previous chapters which begin with retrospective provenance (past events) and work towards prospective provenance (future events), this chapter examines a situation wherein scientists struggled to document retrospective provenance that happens quickly in a computational environment. Prior to the work described in this chapter, scientists in the NMR spectroscopy domain were reliant on using prospective workflow documentation as a surrogate for modeling which steps and algorithms were actually used in past experiments and transformations. Customized uses of PREMIS enable spectroscopists to document both what has happened and what workflows they will employ in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
R. D. Frank,2022,Risk in trustworthy digital repository audit and certification,"Risk is a foundational concept in digital preservation. While it has been examined from technical, economic, and organizational perspectives, I argue that it is also a social phenomenon. In this study I report on the results from 42 interviews with stakeholders in the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification (TRAC) system, and analysis of documents relating to the ISO 16363 standard in order to examine how standard developers, auditors, and repository staff members understand the concept of risk for digital repositories. The results of this research demonstrate that members of these three stakeholder groups identified risk in the TRAC audit and certification process in terms of specific potential threats or sources of risk, which I have organized into five main categories: finance, legal, organizational governance, repository processes, and technical infrastructure. While standard developers, auditors, and repository staff generally shared an understanding of the major sources of potential risk that face digital repositories, they disagreed about whether and how these risks can be mitigated and how mitigation can be proven. Individuals who were more removed from the day-to-day work of the repositories undergoing an audit were more likely to accept well-documented risk identification and mitigation strategies as sufficient evidence of trustworthiness, while repository staff were skeptical that documentation was sufficient evidence of risk assessment and mitigation and thus questioned whether this would translate to actual trustworthiness for long-term digital preservation. © 2021, The Author(s)."
R. El-Behaedi,2022,Detection and 3D Modeling of Potential Buried Archaeological Structures Using WorldView-3 Satellite Imagery,"Throughout the world, cultural heritage sites are under the direct threat of damage or destruction due to developing environmental and anthropogenic hazards, such as urban expansion, looting, and rising water levels. Exacerbating this problem is the fact that many of the most vulnerable sites' exact locations and/or full spatial extents have yet to be uncovered, making any attempts at their protection exceedingly difficult. However, the utilization of earth observation data has recently emerged as an unmatched tool in the exploration and (digital) preservation of endangered archaeological sites. The presented research employs very high-resolution WorldView-3 satellite imagery (~30 cm) for identifying and delineating previously unknown subsurface archaeological structures at the ancient Egyptian site of Hermopolis (el-Ashmunein). A particular emphasis is placed on the application of spectral indices, specifically those looking at vegetation cropmarks and iron oxide levels. Through this analysis, seven promising structures were identified, including three elongated installations, which may have been utilized for storage purposes, and a potential casemate foundation structure. As 2D outlines of structures are often difficult to visualize, the newly identified archaeological features were expanded into a realistic, georeferenced 3D model using the computer programs, SketchUp Pro and Chaos V-Ray. The goal of this 3D model is to ensure that the results derived from this research are more accessible (and tangible) to a wider audience-the scientific community and the public alike. The methodological scheme presented in this article is highly adaptable and with some minor modifications can be replicated for other archaeological sites worldwide."

R. K. Anandan; P. Santhosh Kumar; S. K. Janahan; K. Singh,2022,Improving Discoverability and Indexing of Interplanetary File system using Activitypub,"We inspected a problem where we noticed that we were storing invaluable human civilization and archaeological data on an array of regular web servers or we were dependent on companies providing web services for a limited time. This data is always subject to become unavailable after some amount of time due to reasons such as system failures, no backups, web companies that host web services going out of business, network faults, etc. These servers are not a permanent solution for digital preservation of any kind. Thus we proposed a solution based on the InterPlanetary FileSystem. This solution potentially allows the files to be preserved for an indefinite amount of time. However, like everything else this system has its own drawbacks as well. The content and objects were securely stored on the Interplanetary File System, however, they are not easily searchable on the clear web unless the person storing the content explicitly hyperlinks those objects on the web pages. Hence we are proposing a solution to broadcast the stored data at least once in real-time on the web so that interested entities such as archaeologists, researchers, students, and the general public can access and process them further for their consumption. We call this system the Inter Planetary Broadcaster. © 2022 IEEE."

The analysis was based on the conclusions resulting from the project of digital consolidation of the collection of the Polish press (1801- 1939) of the National Ossoliński Institute during the Lviv period of activity, numbering in September 1939 no fewer than 5000 titles, which, as a result of territorial changes (1945), ended up outside the country. As a result of the efforts undertaken in the years 1946-1947, nearly 1,300 press titles were donated to Wrocław in the form of a “gift”, more than half of which were distributed as a result of the transfer of some annuals or only a supplement, when the main journal was kept. As a result, a total of about 3000 titles remained in Lviv, including over 700 completely or partially unavailable in Poland, currently stored in the Vasyl Stefanyk National Scientific Library of Ukraine in Lviv.

S. Allegrezza,2022,The FITS file format for the long-term preservation of digital objects in the Environment and Earth Observation domain,"One of the most critical problems in the long-term preservation of digital objects in any domain is the rapid obsolescence of file formats that become outdated in a short time and therefore no longer readable. This problem also affects the field of environmental and earth observation, where it is important that the data collected remain accessible for many years to come. For this purpose, in recent years the attention has been focused on an extremely versatile file format created for the astronomy and astrophysics domain but then spread to other sectors as well: the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS). What exactly is it? What are the characteristics of the FITS format that made it so interesting to be a candidate for adoption in the Environment and Earth Observation (EO) field? Is a format that was created over forty years ago still appropriate for long-term preservation? This paper aims at answering these questions by starting from an analysis of the FITS file format and highlighting its features in order to understand if it is appropriate for the archiving and preservation of data collected by many scientific projects in the EO domain. © 2022 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

In this paper we explore how, perhaps counterintuitively, a more extensive digital historical record offers greater opportunities to misrepresent reality. We first review a set of concepts and socio-cultural approaches to memory and preservation. We then focus on the multiplicity of digital memory and preservation practices today, examining their limits, possibilities, and tensions; specifically, we explore the challenges of decontextualized data, personal versus institutional preservation, and outsider"" digital collections that are willingly and/or forcibly excluded from official accounts. Through these discussions, we review examples of what we consider good digital memory and preservation practices that take new approaches to context and collaboration. Lastly, we explore the optimism inherent in seeking to preserve human knowledge over the long term and to make it accessible to all."""
S. Benson,2022,Rights issues in the digitization of library collections,"This chapter addresses the copyright issues that might arise in the digitization of materials held in academic library collections. Developing a clear understanding of the copyright status of digitized materials can be complicated, frustrating, and even at times, with orphan works, impossible, leading to the copyright conundrum. Nonetheless, when curating and managing digitized library collections, a copyright review and management plan should be followed to maximize the availability of open access and public domain items and minimize the confusion of researchers and the public when using such digitized objects. A copyright review protocol, or a map of how to proceed through the copyright analysis, will aid librarians in making decisions regarding what rights metadata to include for a digital work and will, in turn, aid patrons in determining how digitized works can be effectively used. ©2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."
S. Bharti; R. K. Singh,2022,Evaluation and analysis of digital language archives development platforms: a parametric approach,"Purpose: While the obstacles of archiving endangered languages are significant, the question of which platform is best for building a digital language archive is constantly present. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and analyse digital language archives development platforms, such as content management systems (CMSs), digital repositories and archival collections management systems (ACMSs) using parameters that have been specified. The authors selected Mukurtu CMS, which is based on Drupal CMS; DSpace as the digital repository software; and ArchivesSpace as an ACMS in this study. Design/methodology/approach: The current research is supported by a study of the literature and a detailed exploration of different systems used to develop digital language archives. The whole research is carried out in three steps: literature searching; identification of relevant literature; and parameter identification, exploration of tools and data reporting and analysis. Findings: Following the technical and feature analysis of these tools, it can be concluded that they are more or less comparable, as well as constantly evolving, updating and having a bigger community base. It may be determined that DSpace is the most popular platform, but the other two, particularly ArchivesSpaces, are fierce competitors. Research limitations/implications: This study outlines the technical prerequisites for creating a digital language archive, which will be useful to IT personnel working on these projects. The research is also useful for tool developers as it allows them to incorporate missing functionality and technical standards by comparing them to alternatives. The parameters established in this study can be used for similar studies in other domains, as well as for evaluating existing digital language archives. Practical implications: The findings of this study have broad practical implications, and they can assist archivists, linguists, language communities and library and information science professionals in choosing an appropriate platform for building a digital language archive. Originality/value: This study finds that there is relatively little effort made towards reviewing digital language archiving and the systems that are used to do it; thus, this study is carried out to assess and analyse digital language archive creation systems based on defined parameters. The parameters were discovered through a combination of the available literature and tool discovery. Using a parametric approach to evaluate tools yields unique insights and quickly reveals system flaws. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

S. C. Arseni; M. Togan; I. Aciobanitei; E. Bureaca; M. Coca,2022,LTPS - Service for long-term preservation of digital signatures,"Digital transformation of public or private services, although it brings many improvements for our societies, it also raises security issues, mainly when focusing on the migration of physical signed documents in the digital environment. Digital signatures have proven to be reliable, thus they have seen a higher adoption in the last few years, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, a disadvantage is that digital signatures are volatile, being valid only for a maximum of a few years, depending on the validity of the asymmetric private key used to create that digital signature. Thus, validating a signed document after a few years could prove to be troublesome. In order to solve this problem, legislative and standardization efforts have been made and the legal and technical frameworks for long-term preservation services have been issued. In this paper we focus on the presentation of our implementation of a long-term preservation service for digital signatures, that is part of an entire long-term preservation system composed of multiple services, as mentioned in the paper. Our implementation is compliant with ETSI standards and uses the capabilities of current PKI infrastructures, while also adding in the resilience and trust of the blockchain. © 2022 IEEE."

DepthMap, open-source software for studying the visibility of urban core, was used in this study. The utilization of an axial map with a connection map is to frame basic facts in the study. Any strategy to revival or smart city development necessitates a full grasp of the spatial factors and stages that characterize our urban communities, as well as the link between the two. Consequently, this research uses axial analysis and visibility graph analysis to validate the degree of functionality of Kolkata’s Bag Bazar street over time as an input for digital preservation. The paper identifies the period having transformation for each attribute. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

S. K. Schaefer; N. Y. McGovern; E. M. O. Zierau; A. L. Goethals; C. C. M. Wu,2022,Deciding how to decide: Using the Digital Preservation Storage Criteria,"The Digital Preservation Storage Criteria (hereafter, the Criteria) grew out of a community discussion at the 12th International Conference on Digital Preservation (iPRES 2015) on the evolving landscape of digital preservation storage approaches. A Working Group convened to develop guidance for organizations that either use or provide digital preservation storage. The first version of the Criteria was presented at an iPRES 2016 workshop and outlined the Working Group’s preliminary results and sought feedback. The Working Group has shared iterative versions over the last three years that have been informed by community feedback gathered through conference sessions, online review and a survey. Possible uses of the Criteria include helping organizations to develop requirements for their digital preservation storage, evaluating digital preservation storage solutions, raising awareness about digital preservation storage, and providing training materials to inform practitioners and others, including a game to demonstrate how the Criteria might be adapted for use. A Usage Guide accompanied the release of the current public iteration of the Criteria to help apply the Criteria. This iteration of the Criteria contains 61 criteria grouped into categories: Content Integrity, Cost Considerations, Flexibility, Information Security, Resilience, Scalability and Performance, Support, and Transparency. The unreleased draft, Version 4, includes an additional category: System Security. In addition to introducing the Criteria and providing background about their evolution, this article highlights new areas of development. First, the preliminary results from an ongoing effort to map the Criteria to relevant international digital preservation and information technology standards are presented. Second, updates to the Usage Guide are discussed. The Usage Guide is a supplement to the Criteria that provides the contextual information necessary for implementing the Criteria and includes sections on considerations such as risk management, cost, understanding independence and ensuring bit safety. Finally, examples of using the Criteria in various contexts are provided to encourage organizations to apply the Criteria to their own situation. The Criteria, the Usage Guide, the Criteria game and related documents are open and available for review at https://osf.io/sjc6u/, where future additions and updates will be shared. © The Author(s) 2021."

S. Sugimoto; C. Wijesundara; T. Mihara; M. Nagamori,2022,A generalized data model for digital archiving in cultural and historical domains,"There are many digital collections of cultural and historical resources, which are called digital archives in this chapter. Development of digital archives started as digital collection building at memory institutions in early 1990s. Since then, the domains of the digital collection have been expanded, and the technologies used for digital archives have progressed with the development of the Internet and Web. The authors had a question “What real-world object is presented as an item of a digital archive?” from their experiences in previous metadata-centric studies on a database of the Japanese Media Art, metadata for digital archives of disasters, and a data model for digital archives of intangible cultural heritage. The authors learned that current metadata for digital archives is designed based on conventional metadata schemes used at memory institutions and is primarily oriented to describe items held by the institutions. Based on this understanding, the authors propose a generalized data model to describe heterogeneous archived digital objects in a homogeneous framework of metadata. This chapter first describes the background and research questions. Then, following the descriptions of the experiences of the three projects, it shows the proposed data model. © 2022 Francisco-Javier Calzada-Prado. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

T. Balogun; T. Kalusopa,2022,Web archiving of indigenous knowledge systems in South Africa,"The purpose of the paper was to highlight the digitization of Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) in institutional repositories in South Africa with a view to develop a framework for Web archiving IKS-related websites in South Africa. Anchored on the interpretivist paradigm, the qualitative research method was adopted for this research. The multiple case study research strategy was considered appropriate for the study. Data was gathered through face-to-face in-depth interviews and content analysis. Interviews were conducted with eight IKS staff at the IKS Documentation Centres across four provinces in South Africa. The study revealed that although there are efforts to digitize IKS and make them accessible through some channels online, there are no specific digital preservation policies guiding the project. Apart from the fact that there are policies in place to support any Web archiving initiative, the concept of Web archiving was generally unfamiliar to the respondents. The respondents admitting to the lack of a standard policy guiding the digitization project also admitted to a lack of knowledge or in-depth understanding of Web archiving and its prospect as a digital preservation measure. The research, therefore, proposes a Web archiving framework that should be incorporated in the digital preservation policy framework. This research will be useful to policymakers and all stakeholders in South Africa and other parts of Africa. © The Author(s) 2021."

For this we need special software tools, of which there are many available, both paid and free. Since every conversion results in the loss of a certain part of the information within a single unit of digital records, we wanted to find answers to the key question of which software tools to use in order to minimize these losses. In the research, we also included software tools that can be used to check the suitability of conversions of digital records from one format to another. The key goal of the research was to find suitable software tools for converting individual types of digital records and verifying these conversions, thereby facilitating the conversion process especially for creators of archival digital records. © 2022, Maribor Provincial Archives.

T. K. Gireesh Kumar,2022,"Identification, documentation and promotion of cultural heritage: problems and prospects in the Indian context","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to overview the current state of affairs of the Indian heritage treasures, which are being identified, restored, preserved and promoted by various organizations at national and international levels with an emphasis on its documentation aspect. Lack of information about the heritage sites, structures and its significance, especially unprotected and unidentified, leads to its permanent loss. One of the prominent measures to safeguard from such irrevocable cultural deprivation is its documentation. Further, the study aims to examine the significant challenges associated with identifying unrevealed heritage assets of the country in the context of its preservation, documentation and promotion. As a suggestive measure, the study aims to propose the need for developing a comprehensive cultural heritage register assisted with technological aids focusing on community participation in taking stock of the heritage items they possess and enable them to effectively document. Design/methodology/approach: The present study extracts the cultural heritage data available with the UNESCO belongs to Indian heritage assets inscribed in its World Heritage portal. The collected data has been analyzed and interpreted to overview the country's recognition at the global level. The data collected from the official portal is further explored and customized to have a lucid account. The details about the organizations and institutions working on heritage conservation and preservation activities in India are also collected. A review of published literature on the related areas has also been performed to identify the issues and challenges associated with the documentation of heritage assets to support this study. The study also included the researcher’s experience in working with cultural heritage documentation. Findings: India holds a substantial quantity of cultural as well as natural heritage items. However, an exhaustive effort to document them at the national level is not being accomplished to its full potential. Many of the assets, inheritances or sites of cultural importance have not been fully identified, preserved or documented; hence, it is unrecalled forever once lost. Some organizations and individuals working on cultural heritage lack clarity in its function and do not follow any common standards in its documentation. For any conservation activity, documentation is prime, and the local community's support is also essential. Means of international collaboration for managing and promoting the heritage are required to be encouraged. Findings of the study demand the need for utilizing digital technologies to assist the documentation process. It emphasizes the requirement of having a web-based single window online gateway where an individual or community can dispense the knowledge and resources they possess hence contributing to heritage conservation, preservation and sustainability. Research limitations/implications: The study limited to Indian scenario and the data on the heritage sites are collected from UNESCO's World Heritage portal. Only the documentation and promotional aspects of the cultural heritage are discussed. There are many lesser-known and unprotected cultural heritage in different parts of the country with artistic value. The unique characteristics that have not been recorded anywhere are to be documented systematically to reduce the frequency and severity of losses. The implication of the study highlights the present scenario of cultural heritage documentation in India and the need for a comprehensive heritage information gateway supported with a register facility to precisely document and retrieve. Practical implications: Aspects of culture which are inherited from the past to the present are to be preserved for future generations. Digital archives of cultural heritage and the use of digital tools to document them are effective mechanisms to protect and store the data on endangered heritage items. For any such conservation effort, documentation is its first step. Developing and f cilitating access to an exclusive database of cultural heritage at risk boast its sustainability and can be enriched by the involvement of local communities. Public access to such a database would greatly support administrators, tourist departments, culture departments, development administration and conservation activists to gather the details of unprotected heritage items of the country, its present condition, risk of damage, etc. which further helps in its preservation, conservation, sustainability and promotion in a constructive manner. Originality/value: To the authors' best knowledge, no such single and comprehensive mechanism in the country allow the individuals to contribute to the inventory list holding information about the identified, unprotected and unidentified heritage assets which are having a risk of damage, threat, decay, vulnerable, neglect, lack of use or inappropriate maintenance and development. Developing such a system with technological and data infrastructure helps to pool all the cultural heritage resources under one umbrella. It imparts the value and significance of protecting and promoting heritage inheritances and a safe haven of them from the risk of its chronic loss. The system can also support all the activities related to heritage protection and bring the local community to timely support and initiate such heritage conservation activities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
T. Kinoshita; T. Onuma,2022,Digital Preservation at GLAMs in Japan,"In recent years, many GLAMs have come to hold more digital materials than ever before, and the long-term digital preservation of these materials has become an issue. The National Diet Library of Japan (NDL) has actively conducted research into and shared information about digital preservation with other domestic institutions. The implementation of effective preservation measures requires an appropriate understanding of the present state of digital preservation, yet a comprehensive survey targeting the GLAM sector in Japan has never been attempted thus far. Given this background, we conducted a questionnaire survey on digital preservation activities that targeted nearly all GLAMs in Japan. A total of 5,409 institutions were surveyed, and 2,921 responses were received. The results show that while the majority of GLAMs in Japan hold digital materials intended for long-term preservation, few have established relevant policies or implemented plans to put effective digital preservation measures in practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
T. Osterland; T. Rose,2022,Maintain the Persistence of a Distributed Ledger for Future Generations,"Blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) guarantees revision safety of transaction logs independent from usage scenarios. Thus, trust is ensured by DLT in a long-term perspective. Hence, one can pose the question, whether DLT is an attractive technology for long-term archiving of data. In this paper we juxtapose distributed ledger and data preservation approaches as two candidates for continuous archival workings. We show that, although the DLT seems to be a viable solution for the long-term preservation of data from a naive perspective, long time effects and efficiency considerations prevent the effective use of DLTs. We discuss hidden costs of transactions, that are not reflected in current price structures. We conclude that data stored on the distributed ledger might not be as preserved for future generations as usually assumed. In fact, data preservation in an archivist's perspective resembles the trust preservation in DLTs. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery."
T. Sriraman,2022,Affective Activism and Digital Archiving: Relief Work and Migrant Workers during the Covid-19 Lockdown in India,"This article traces what I term the affective activism of volunteers, civil society organizations, and lorry drivers engaged in relief work to assist stranded migrant workers wanting to travel home during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic and national lockdown in India. I define affective activism as an archival practice that is driven by relief figures’ affects of fear, anger, and aspirations—in this instance, toward their legal and administrative accountability to funders. Drawing on my ethnographic work in a relief network and using independent interviews I conducted, this article critically compares two modalities of digital archiving conducted by relief figures: collecting migrant workers’ Aadhaar—unique biometric number identifiers issued to Indians—and digitally archiving their relief efforts through videos, voice-notes, and WhatsApp Messenger screenshots. I argue that relief figures expressed their anxieties in the form of talismanic beliefs that records of Aadhaar and their material infrastructure would keep safe the migrant workers they were trying to help. Alternately, and sometimes, concomitantly, they performatively deployed Whatsapp artifacts to support their accountability in the face of bureaucratic and political specters. Both forms highlight the desire of relief figures to exceed paper forms and state practices in their archival impulses.

U. Ferretti; R. Quattrini; M. D’alessio,2022,A Comprehensive HBIM to XR Framework for Museum Management and User Experience in Ducal Palace at Urbino,"Digitization of Cultural and Museum Heritage represents one of the most engaging challenges that would ensure a sustainable and ethical approach for next generations; digital technology’s pervasiveness imposes a comprehensive management of architectural heritage by producing facsimiles of buildings and artworks and by testing robust methodologies, with the final result of providing effective multipurpose models. In this context, the main goal of the present paper is to develop a semantically aware HBIM model that includes an intelligent objects parametrization, leveraging Extended Reality (XR) technologies and digital curation of contents to pursue the preservation of Cultural Heritage (CH) as a whole. This research is implemented in the case study of the Ducal Palace of Urbino that houses the National Gallery of Marche. It was chosen as a remarkable example of a museum located in an architectural complex with a relevant historical background and fine detail of shapes and mouldings. In Italy, as in other European scenarios, museums and their collections need suitable dissemination and management systems that take advantage of the recent digital paradigms. The challenging approach is to exploit existing platforms and software and to adopt a cognitive modelling process, able to develop tools supporting managers and museum curators while enabling user experiences using immersive and interactive features. In order to stress the workflow, this work proposes the use of families with high Level of Detail (LOD) and high Level of Information (LOI). The present article provides, as well, an accurate data enrichment process specifically designed for a gallery’s artworks such as paintings and sculptures, in line with the national and international policies. The study presents a robust and reproducible methodology for digital musealization and management, focusing, as future overall objectives, towards a greater merging between the HBIM approach and XR technologies, also facilitated by training new professional figures with more in-depth digital skills. © 2022 by the authors.

U. M. Borghoff; E. Pfeiffer; P. Rödig,2022,Long-Term Lifecycle-Related Management of Digital Building Documents: Towards a Holistic and Standard-based Concept for a Technical and Organizational Solution in Building Authorities,"The long-term lifecycle-related management of digital building information is essential to improve the overall quality of public built assets. However, this management task still poses great challenges for building authorities, as they are usually responsible for large, heterogeneous and long-lived built assets with countless of data sets and documents that are increasingly changing from analogue to digital representations. These digital collections are characterized by complex dependencies, by numerous different, sometimes highly specialized and proprietary formats and also by their inappropriate organization. The major challenge is to ensure completeness, consistency and usability over the entire lifecycle of buildings or their associated digital data and documents. In this paper, we present an approach for a holistic and standard-based concept for a technical and organizational solution in building authorities. Holistic means integrating concepts for the long-term usability of digital building information, taking into account the framework conditions described in building authorities, including the introduction of BIM (building information modeling). To this end, we outline how the concepts of the consolidated and widely accepted ISO-standardized reference model OAIS (open archive information system) can be applied to a building-specific information architecture. First, we sketch the history of electronic data processing in the building sector and introduce the essential concepts of OAIS. Then, we illustrate typical major actors and their (future) IT systems, including systems intended for OAIS-compliant long-term usability. Next, we outline major (future) software components and their interactions and assignment to lifecycle phases. Finally, we delineate how the generic information model of OAIS can be used. In summary, ensuring the long-term usability of digital information in the building sector will remain a grand challenge, but our proposed approach to the systematic application and further refinement of the OAIS reference model can help to better organize future discussions as well as research, development and implementation activities. We conclude with some suggestions for further research based on the concepts of the OAIS reference model, such as refining information models or developing information repositories needed for long-term interpretation of digital objects. © 2022 ACM."

W. Buranasing; W. Lilakiataskun,2022,Semantic Relation Extraction from Cultural Heritage Archives,"Digital preservation technologies are now being increasingly adopted by cultural heritage organizations. This cultural heritage data is often disseminated in the form of digital text through a variety of channels such as Wikipedia, cultural heritage archives, etc. To acquire knowledge from digital data, the extraction technique becomes an important part. However, in the case of digital text, which has characteristics such as ambiguity, complex grammar structures such as the Thai language, and others, it makes it more challenging to extract information with a high level of accuracy. We thus propose a method for improving the performance of data extraction techniques based on word features, multiple instance learning, and unseen word mapping. Word features are used to improve the quality of word definition by concatenating parts of speech (POS) and word position is used to establish the accurate definition of a word and convert all of this into a vector. In addition, we use multiple instance learning to solve issues where words do not fully express the meaning of the triple. We also cluster the particular word to find the predicate word by removing words that are irrelevant between the subject and the object. The difficulty of having a new set of words that have never been trained before can be overcome by using unseen word mapping with subword and nearest neighbor word mapping.We conducted several experiments on a cultural heritage knowledge graph to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that our proposed technique outperforms existing models currently utilized in relation to extraction systems. It can achieve excellent accuracy since its precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.89, 0.88, and 0.89, respectively. Furthermore, it also performed well in terms of unseen word prediction, precision, recall, and F1 score, which were 0.81, 0.87, and 0.84, respectively. © 2022 River Publishers. All rights reserved."

Fu,2022,Effect of 11-year storage of GMO reference material at ultra-low temperature on nucleic acid detection of standard matrix sample of transgenic crop,"Reference material is indispensable for the reliability, comparability, and accuracy of transgenic detection results. In this paper, the effects of long-term preservation of matrix reference materials on PCR detection and the stability of low content reference materials were studied. The reproducibility and quantity stability of transgenic reference materials and transgenic samples with different contents were detected by three methods (common qualitative PCR, real-time fluorescent PCR, and droplet digital PCR). The result showed that the transgenic reference material with 0.1% GM content could still be clearly amplified after 9 years of storage, and the Ct value was about 36. The digital PCR revealed that the quantity of GM matrix reference materials remained stable for long storage time. There was no effect on the detection of transgenic elements in sample mixed with soybean, corn and rice powder which stored at -70 to -75℃ for 11 years. In summary, the long-term storage of GM matrix reference materials at low temperature would not affect the detection of each transgenic component and its application as a positive control for transgenic nucleic acid detection."

Y. D. López,2022,Digital documents and Archival Legislation: the case of Mexico and Cuba,"The Documentary Heritage of a nation has a strong component of digital documents that is generated to-day in public administration. Its management, treat-ment and access to this documentary specificity are subject to regulation and protection by law. The ar-chival laws of Latin America have in these supports an inescapable challenge. Mexico (2018) and Cuba (2020) are the most contemporary legal bodies and they already evoke these records. With this premise, the objective of this article is to comparatively ana-lyze the legal regulations of digital documents, based on the Archival Legislation of Mexico and Cuba, in order to obtain conclusive assessments that serve as a norm for the Latin American territory. The methodology and techniques used were those inherent to the theoretical-legal field, comparative, analytical-deductive and technical analysis of legal documents. An evaluative comparison of both corpus was ob-tained regarding this object of protection and rec-ommendations are inferred, in this sense for Latin America. It was concluded that digital documents are an indissoluble part of the Documentary Heri-tage; the Mexican and Cuban position of legal protection of the digital document and its archive, in a normative spirit, is not to contemplate the support. © 2022, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Y. Li; D. H. C. Du; L. Ou; B. Li,2022,HL-DNA: A Hybrid Lossy/Lossless Encoding Scheme to Enhance DNA Storage Density and Robustness for Images,"With the storage's demand for high density and long-term preservation, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) has become a promising candidate to satisfy the requirement of archival storage for rapidly increased digital volume. However, due to the biochemical constraints, DNA storage faces critical issues of low practical capacity and robustness. In this paper, we target image applications and propose to apply approximation to DNA storage to improve the overall encoding density and robustness of DNA storage by using a hybrid lossy and lossless encoding scheme (called HL-DNA). Several lossy and lossless encoding schemes (lossy and lossless codes) are proposed and used to encode incoming binary sequences. These two types of codes are coordinated to balance the encoding density and errors. The lossless codes are used to limit the errors and the lossy codes are used to improve the encoding density. Moreover, the introduced approximation and newly proposed hybrid encoding schemes in one DNA strand can improve the robustness of DNA storage. Finally, the experimental results indicate that the proposed HL-DNA improves the encoding density of DNA storage and makes it much close to the ideal case. Also, HL-DNA achieves higher robustness to the injected errors than other DNA storage codes. © 2022 IEEE."

Through the Memory of the World research network that could be forged globally, UNESCO aims for concerted efforts in mediating, safeguarding, and even promoting cultural heritage by new means of information communicating technologies [2]. Nonetheless the efforts, although commendable, have been more focused on the digital documentation instead of promotion of cultural heritage. Concurrently, as China attaches great importance to “entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship” education, college students’ innovation and entrepreneurship education has become an important field of research in China. This study defines intangible cultural heritage, explains digitization of intangible cultural heritage, points out the limitations of the efforts on digital preservation, overviews entrepreneurship education for college students in China, and proposes a pedagogical model targeted at new media art in higher education which seeks to propagate the efforts to digitally preserve and promote intangible cultural heritage under the values of innovation and entrepreneurship. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Z. Wang; K. Wang; Y. Wang; Z. Wen,2022,A Data Management Model for Intelligent Water Project Construction Based on Blockchain,"The engineering construction-related data is essential for evaluating and tracing project quality in industry 4.0. Specifically, the preservation of the information is of great significance to the safety of intelligent water projects. This paper proposes a blockchain-based data management model for intelligent water projects to achieve standardization management and long-term preservation of archives. Based on studying the concrete production process in water conservancy project construction, we first build a behavioral model and the corresponding role assignment strategy to describe the standardized production process. Then, a distributed blockchain data structure for storing the production-related files is designed according to the model and strategy. In addition, to provide trust repository and transfer on the construction data, an intelligent keyless signature based on edge computing is employed to manage the data's entry, modification, and approval. Finally, standardized and secure information is uploaded onto the blockchain to supervise intelligent water project construction quality and safety effectively. The experiments showed that the proposed model reduced the time and labor cost when generating the production data and ensured the security and traceability of the electronic archiving of the documents. Blockchain and intelligent keyless signatures jointly provide new data sharing and trading methods in intelligent water systems. © 2022 Zhoukai Wang et al."

A. Baillot,2023,From handwriting to footprinting: Text and heritage in the age of climate crisis,"How do we currently preserve and access texts, and will our current methods be sustainable in the future? In From Handwriting to Footprinting, Anne Baillot seeks to answer this question by offering a detailed analysis of the methods that enable access to textual materials, in particular, access to books of literary significance. Baillot marshals her considerable expertise in the field of digital humanities to establish a philological overview of the changing boundaries of 'access' to literary heritage over centuries, deconstructing the western tradition of archiving and how it has led to current digital dissemination practices. Rigorously examining the negative environmental impact of digital publishing and archiving, Baillot proposes an alternative model of preservation and dissemination which reconciles fundamental traditions with the values of social responsibility and sustainability in an era of climate crisis. Integrating historical, archival and environmental perspectives, From Handwriting to Footprinting illuminates the impact that digitisation has had on the dissemination and preservation of textual heritage and reflects on what its future may hold. It is invaluable reading for anyone interested in textual history from a linguistic or philological perspective, as well as those working on publishing, archival and infrastructure projects that require the storing and long-term preservation of texts, or who want to know how to develop a more mindful attachment to digitised material. © 2023 Anne Baillot."

A. G. Campbell; L. Becel; C. Cornuez,2023,Digital Preservation of Experiences in Virtual Worlds: Using Metaverse Worlds to Preserve VR Research Worlds,"Over 20 years after Second Life's debut, marking the first metaverse concept, the term has evolved beyond a buzzword. Many virtual worlds now have mature APIs for various applications, imbuing the term with real meaning as more than just a marketing term for online virtual worlds. During this same period, the use of 3D worlds for academic research has become much more prevalent. These worlds tend to have very ethereal existences, exploring one area of human-computer interaction and not engineered in any way for longevity due to being built. This paper is part of a trilogy of short papers exploring this topic, aimed at different audiences. This middle paper is aimed at game developers and academics to start a discussion of how it could be possible to preserve research within metaverse platforms such as VRChat or built from the ground up for these platforms. Metaverse platforms, of course, can be just as ethereal, but in the future, if such platforms became mainstream, they would potentially still offer a longer period of accessibility. The paper reports on the recreation of a VR experience designed to explore the effect of immersive experiences on changing people's opinions on climate change, and a second VR experience was written just for this paper to explore the conversion process starting with an application. These examples are used to illustrate the process, and a performance test is conducted to show the impact of using the VRChat API, which from these tests, demonstrates it is not a significant bottleneck in terms of performance, could limit some UI interactions options for the researcher, and ultimately does create applications that could be easier to share with the community. © 2023 IEEE."

A. K. Sinha; S. Kumar; H. M. Singh,2023,A Framework for Designing Long Term Digital Preservation System,"Now a days, we are moving towards smart urbanized world wherein rich and easily assessable information system can help to manage the dynamic changing urban world. Digital data preservation plays an important role to make strategies for smart cities. Digital preservation system is composed of policies, approaches and actions with the aim of keeping the digital objects authentic and accessible to users for a long period of time irrespective of challenges like failures, disasters or attacks. This has become a key issue in recent years. due to continuous increase in the amount of digital assets and advancement in technological structure, there is obsolescence of hardware and software required to store and access of the digitized information. So, there is a need to preserve the data for long term which could be easly accessed from anywhere and anytime to support the strategic decisions in making urban cities smart. This paper first, presents a method as Research Strategy to carryout system study analysis of its current operational status with respect to existing preservation practices for its digital data towards long term.

A. Kriesberg,2023,Examining Social Media Policy and Records Management in Massachusetts Municipal Governments,"This paper reports on an exploratory analysis of the social media policies of municipal governments in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. With a strong Public Records law and language clearly indicating that social media posts are government records, Massachusetts provides a framing for research into municipal policy on social media use, retention, preservation, and access. Of the 351 municipalities in the Commonwealth, just 87 have publicly accessible Social Media policies. These policies indicate that municipal governments take their responsibilities around social media records management seriously, they do not offer many specifics around how they will engage directly with posts from privately-owned social media platforms. Implications of these findings suggest that the digital preservation community must continue to develop tools and methods to preserve social media records the support broader efforts around government transparency and accountability, as well as advocate for platforms to include features to support responsible public sector social media use.

A. Nogueira; C. G. Marques; A. Manso; P. Almeida,2023,NFTs and the Danger of Loss,"This research contributes to the discussion around the importance of the long-term preservation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and minted digital artworks. The paper is based on a review of the literature on blockchain in art and heritage management and conservation, with particular attention to references related to the production, marketing, maintenance, and distribution of NFT-based digital art. The aims of this paper involve anticipating potential problems in the oversight of NFTs and setting out good long-term management principles and practices as well as specific preservation strategies. Despite the fact that it also discusses issues over authorship, copyright, creative commons, and open access, the paper is particularly devoted to raising concerns about the high energy consumption associated with blockchain technology and its impact on climate change. It also highlights how the preservation of NFTs cannot be neglected, despite the belief that they last forever. Most studies dedicated to analysing the impact of blockchain technology on the cultural heritage sector ignore the most important issue: preserving not only the minted digital artworks themselves but also the respective blockchain networks. Overall, this paper seeks to foster a collective awareness of the need to reflect on blockchain-related art practices and their implications for the long-term protection of cultural property. © 2023 by the authors."
A. P. García; M. I. C. Plaza,2023,The digital preservation of audiovisual heritage on magnetic media at the National Library of Spain,"The Biblioteca Nacional de España (BNE, the National Library of Spain) is well aware of the dangers facing its audiovisual heritage due to the instability, vulnerability, and degradation of the media on which it is stored. This is so even though the materials are preserved under controlled environmental conditions. For this reason, the library is allocating part of its resources to the digitization of this heritage as a preservation measure. In this paper we outline the main tasks involved. We stress the importance of selecting the material to be digitized, especially in the case of a collection as voluminous as the one belonging to the National Library. We also discuss the diwculties in deciding the formats and digitization parameters, and how these decisions will depend largely on the quality of the originals and the available resources. Lastly, we highlight the importance of recording information in metadata Vles and the steps that need to be taken to preserve this digital collection in the long term. © 2023 Universitat de Barcelona.

A. Solovyev; I. Tarkhanov,2023,A Systematic Approach to Long-Term Storage of Documents Using Digital Twin Technologies,"The article discusses the modeling of the use of digital twin technologies (a digital twin) for the task of organizing long-term storage of various types of documents. A digital twin in this respect differs from a digital copy, which has no connection with the real original object. A review of the problem was carried out. We argue that, despite the active use of digital twin technology in various areas, its applications in the area of long-term storage of documents remain limited. At the same time, the task of increasing the durability of documents during long-term storage remains important and largely unresolved. The complexity of solving the problem of long-term storage of documents is considered, and a formal statement of the problem of long-term storage using digital twin technologies is carried out. Destructive factors that affect long-term storage documents and significantly reduce their durability have been identified. A system of indicators has been developed to assess the durability (preservation) of documents. The modeling of the use of digital twin technology in the organization of long-term preservation within the framework of Industry 4.0 was carried out. In the course of modeling, the goals and the strategies of long-term storage were established. Primary mathematical models for controlling destructive factors as well as technological solutions for digital twin long-term storage are proposed. It is assumed that the key part of this technology is the Industrial Internet of Things. The effectiveness of the use of digital twin technologies for solving the problem was assessed. The spheres of application and further ways of research are determined. © 2023 by the authors."

This paper investigates the construction of a multimodal database for cultural heritage sites, which aims to preserve 3D data, images, videos and other materials along with multilingual text data. 3D scanning is widely used for efficient and accurate digitization of cultural heritages. However, some sites have been damaged entirely or partially, or sometimes, it is impossible to conduct 3D scanning of a portion of a site that is hidden from sight. At the Borobudur temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site, there are buried reliefs that are hidden at the basement and inaccessible for 3D scanning. Currently available data for these inaccessible portions of the site include old photos, computer-aided design (CAD) drawings and historical written descriptions. To digitally reconstruct 3D models of hidden parts, we introduce a method that use a single monocular photo. We constructed “Borobudur Visual Archives” to store, access, view and retrieve Borobudur-related digital assets, including the 3D data that we created. © Author(s) 2023."

Based on our analysis of the COURAGE (Cultural Opposition—Understanding the CultuRal HeritAGE of Dissent in the Former Socialist Countries) Registry about cultural dissent under state socialism in Eastern Europe in the second half of the twentieth century (and focusing on collections about environmental issues in this registry), we seek to understand how different private, amateur, and professional archivists have shaped the scientific and public legacy of cultural dissent under state socialism. The COURAGE Registry conveys a unique view of the history of the Soviet Bloc, providing an assemblage of documents concerning people, groups, institutions, events, and pieces from the time. Together, they tell an alternative story of cultural opposition under socialism, shedding light on important—but until now marginalized—problems, topics, and actors. Our results have shown that cultural opposition in the Registry is understood and constructed as a wide range of forms of engagement and activities, and it is not limited to specific high-cultural or direct political products. The structure of the COURAGE Registry creates a balance among collections that are very diverse in form, and its linked data structure helps connect the information and stories compiled in it. The COURAGE Registry enables researchers to use it as a tool with which to build their own scientific narratives about dissent under socialism. © 2022 Sage Publications."

Palmer,2023,The Medical Institutional Repositories in Libraries (MIRL) Symposium: a blueprint designed in response to a community of practice need,"Background: Health sciences libraries in medical schools, academic health centers, health care networks, and hospitals have established institutional repositories (IRs) to showcase their research achievements, increase visibility, expand the reach of institutional scholarship, and disseminate unique content. Newer roles for IRs include publishing open access journals, tracking researcher productivity, and serving as repositories for data sharing. Many repository managers oversee their IR with limited assistance from others at their institution. Therefore, IR practitioners find it valuable to network and learn from colleagues at other institutions. Case Presentation: This case report describes the genesis and implementation of a new initiative specifically designed for a health sciences audience: the Medical Institutional Repositories in Libraries (MIRL) Symposium. Six medical librarians from hospitals and academic institutions in the U.S. organized the inaugural symposium held virtually in November 2021. The goal was to fill a perceived gap in conference programming for IR practitioners in health settings. Themes of the 2021 and subsequent 2022 symposium included IR management, increasing readership and engagement, and platform migration. Post-symposium surveys were completed by 73/238 attendees (31%) in 2021 and by 62/180 (34%) in 2022. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Discussion: Participant responses in post-symposium surveys rated MIRL highly. The MIRL planning group intends to continue the symposium and hopes MIRL will steadily evolve, build community among IR practitioners in the health sciences, and expand the conversation around best practices for digital archiving of institutional content. The implementation design of MIRL serves as a blueprint for collaboratively bringing together a professional community of practice. © 2023, Medical Library Association. All rights reserved."
B. Girotti; P.

It is called TyPAL (Teatro y Política en América Latina) and it is hosted as a fonds inside the Audiovisual Archive of the Gino Germani Research Institute at the University of Buenos Aires. Within the framework of this issue’s dossier, we aim to approach some of the productive tensions that emerge when working with the archive, and that are connected to its definition as an audiovisual theatrical archive. We organized our reflections on a series of pairings that condense these productive tensions-theatrical research/archive; theatrical/audiovisual; analogical/digital; personal archives/institutional archives- and that allowed us to analyze some of the specific circumstances and conceptual discussions in which the TyPAL is framed and that let us address issues of performing arts research in the context of the growing archival interest widespread in contemporary culture. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.

B. Jurca,2023,Process of Analogue Film Tape Digitization,"Most of film archival material is originally written on analogue film tape. Digitization is a process of converting or transcribing analogue signal into a digital code and is for the time being one of the most efficient ways of preserving contents recorded on film tapes. Digitization enables long-term preservation of film archival records as well as usability of such records in contemporary digital environment. The optimum time for digitization of the original analogue film tape is when the content recorded on the tape is still well-preserved. It is also imperative that enough is known about the film tape itself, which enables us to prepare it for image and sound capture. The article describes the individual stages involved in film tape digitization: preparation of the original materials, capture of image and sound, control, processing, and submitting of digital film archival material to archivists in charge of entering it into databases. The article describes digitization process as it is conducted since 2020 at the Slovenian Film Archives. © 2023, Maribor Provincial Archives. All rights reserved."

The research sample consists of 1589 journals from nine Central European countries registered in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Results show that of the 1589 journals, 69% of them have an archiving policy. In terms of the number of indexed journals, Poland ranks first with 592 journals. Switzerland is at the forefront of digital archiving with 89% of archived journals. It was also found that Portico and national libraries are the most widely used archives, and that 19% of the preserved journals are archived in more than one archive. A preliminary analysis was also conducted to investigate the possible existence of a relationship between journal rank and digital archiving. The results show a higher number of JCR indexed titles, as well as a higher ranking, among archived journals. The paper also compares the status of archiving policies among Asian and Central European countries. The results reveal that archived journals are significantly more represented in Central European countries. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

Hodges,2023,Algorithmic futures: the intersection of algorithms and evidentiary work,"The role of algorithms in decision-making is now so consequential that we agree that algorithmic systems must be designed, implemented, and managed in ways that are understandable to interested parties. Anchored in a tradition of capturing, contextualizing, and preserving evidence of analog and digital technologies, this article draws out the roles adopted or tried on by the recordkeeping professions to account for algorithmic systems as they communicate and represent meaning in the world. We begin by delineating a promising role for recordkeeping professions as algorithmic conceptualizers. We show how expertise in evaluating recorded information provides a method to conceive or model algorithms from an accountability and transparency perspective. Then we delineate a breakthrough role for recordkeeping professionals as algorithmic historicizers, revealing how the professions’ curation of records of human actions extends to the capture and preservation of algorithms for purposes of critical review. Finally, we delineate an emerging role for recordkeeping professionals as algorithmic sponsors involved in harnessing algorithmic tools to manage and make accessible other forms of digital evidence at scale. In articulating such roles, our goal is to examine the opportunities inherent in harnessing the relationships that form at the intersection of algorithmic activity and evidentiary work. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
C. D. Olteanu; C. V. Doicin; N. Ionescu; A. M. Țîțu,2023,Contributions Regarding the Implementation of the Digital Archiving Process in a Public Organization,"The scientific paper presents original research on implementing the digital archiving process within a public organization. Current archiving is mainly done in physical format, which is not beneficial. Physical archiving involves using significant material resources, physical space resources, time resources, and additional human resources. The research proposed by the authors follows the orientation of the current society towards the digitization of the activities of a public organization and the implementation of digital archiving, considerably reducing the resources used for physical archiving and, finally, the quality of the services offered to citizens can increase significantly. In this scientific paper, we have proposed mathematical modeling that respects a dedicated research methodology and is carried out with experimental data analysis software. Later I processed and interpreted the experimental data. More, an estimate was made for 20 years of the number of files that should be archived. The digital capacity required for the digital archiving of the scanned documents, the estimation of the time needed for the scanning documents, and the estimation of the energy consumption required for the scanning documents for archiving were also estimated. At the end of the paper, the conclusions that emerge from this essential and helpful research to be effectively implemented are presented. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

From this discussion and the comparison of the data processing of an emblematic Mexican object, the Piedra de Sol, we show the positive consequences of adopting specific standardization processes and of proposing a strategy of interoperability between repositories, as well as the results of standardization with metadata schemas. Some recommendations are also made to consolidate a future digital preservation program for Mexico's cultural heritage, which should be agreed upon by researchers, administrators, institution managers, and other agents in the cultural sphere."
C. Neudecker,2023,Digital curation and AI: Opportunities and risks for cultural heritage institutions,"Numerous use cases, from text recognition to image analysis or classification to contextualization, have already demonstrated how digitization and curation can benefit from the use of AI.

D. Ilie; C. Moldoveanu; O. L. Balota,2023,"DIGITAL CONSERVATION OF HERITAGE BUILDINGS USING A UAV SYSTEM CONFIGURED FOR LATERAL SCANNING AND IMAGES, COMBINED WITH A HYBRID PROCESSING METHOD","The preservation of heritage buildings is essential in a modern society that understands the importance of architecture, culture, and history. The lack of reconstruction funds or the vision of the decision-makers can delay the realization of the works to protect these buildings. The digital conservation of these buildings can be a solution for a later reconstruction or for the creation of a realistic virtual museum. The article presents the rigorous setup and calibration of an airborne side scanner mounted on a UAV platform. Acquiring fine architectural details involves the use of more precise scanning sensors, with substantially higher costs, leading to delays. The present study shows that medium precision scanning sensors can also be used for digitizing architectural details. The side scan solution can be applied successfully in the digital preservation of buildings with a medium degree of detail, but it can also be useful in complex cases. Using optimal processing methods greatly improves the internal accuracy of the modelling with little loss in accuracy. The proposed methodology can be applied even when using superior sensors, leading to exceptional results."
D. M. Piotrowski; P. Marzec,2023,Digital curation and open-source software in LAM-related publications,"The changing conditions in which LAM institutions operate require constant monitoring of the development of solutions dedicated to different forms of their activities. This article aims at an analysis of the literature related to LAM institutions on open-source software used in digital curation. The undertaken research was an attempt to check the interest in this issue in publications registered in the BASE multi-search database.

D. Novák; A. Oniszczuk; B. Gumbert,2023,Digital Archaeological Archiving Policies and Practice in Europe: the EAC call for action,"The digital transition in archaeology is often taken for granted, yet the process is far from complete. The topic of digital archiving has been addressed by both the EAC Working Group for Archaeological Archives and the SEADDA COST Action. These two entities joined forces to produce a special issue of Internet Archaeology, bringing together contributions on digital archiving practices from over two dozen countries. The articles were later analysed by EAC and SEADDA to compare the international situation. The results reveal both shared difficulties associated with the issue of documentary archives worldwide and examples of good practices that help to overcome these problems. A questionnaire survey was also carried out to complement the findings resulting from the interpretation of the published articles, with supporting data covering the whole European area in a balanced way. The survey allowed for the compilation of an overview of the situation in 27 countries (30 regions) of Europe. All respondents were experts involved in digital archiving and/or heritage data management in individual countries. Based on the collected information, the discrepancy between the value of archaeological data and its position within heritage management practice is already proving to be a major shortcoming. There are imbalances in the level of attention - and the resulting level of protection - given to archives of (digital) archaeological documentation. If we want to find a way to improve the situation, it is necessary to initiate systemic changes, which should manifest themselves on a number of levels. However, these changes are conditional on a political decision that will give the whole process legitimacy, the necessary resources, a clear framework, and the required tools. It is needed to formulate general principles and co-create an environment, including a legislative one, in which archaeological archiving can be carried out in a sustainable and meaningful way in order to bring the highest possible public benefit. Compared with other initiatives, we consider it essential to primarily follow the systemic changes (top-down approach) rather than strive for change in the individual practice of researchers. It is the only way to achieve the real persistence of irreplaceable archaeological data. This article summarises the results achieved and presents proposed approaches to improve the situation in digital archaeological archiving. It concludes, among other things, by proposing a set of guiding principles for archiving primary archaeological data. © 2023 Council for British Archaeology. All rights reserved."
D. R. Donaldson; S. V. Russell,2023,Trustworthy Digital Repository Certification: A Longitudinal Study,"Increasingly, government policies are directing federal agencies to make the results of federally funded scientific research publicly available in data repositories. Additionally, academic journal policies are progressively recommending that researchers deposit the data upon which they base their articles in repositories to ensure their long-term preservation and access. Unfortunately, having the necessary technical, legal, financial, and organizational resources for digital preservation is a significant challenge for some repositories. Repositories that become certified as Trustworthy Digital Repositories (TDRs) demonstrate to their stakeholders (e.g., users, funders) that an authoritative third party has evaluated them and verified their trustworthiness. To understand the impact of certification on repositories’ infrastructure, processes, and services, we analyzed a sample of publicly available TDR audit reports (n = 175) from the Data Seal of Approval (DSA) and Core Trust Seal (CTS) certification programs. This first longitudinal study of TDR certification over a ten-year period (from 2010 to 2020) found that many repositories either maintain a relatively high standard of trustworthiness in terms of their compliance with guidelines in DSA or CTS standards or improve their trustworthiness by raising their compliance levels with these guidelines each time they get recertified. Although preparing for audit and certification adds to repository staff’s dockets of responsibilities, our study suggests that certification can be beneficial. Therefore, we advocate for more specific policies that encourage certification and the use of TDRs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

One of the research objectives is to define a methodological and operational workflow for developing a virtual environment designed using a social virtual environment. The use of social worlds in virtual reality (VR) is one of the possible entry points to the metaverse, understood as a way of experiencing digital reality. The possibility of creating a digital space that replicates real space offers not only the opportunity for people to gather in a virtual place but also allows designers to provide a parallel and augmented experience in terms of content.The case study aims to create the digital twin of the temporary Phygital Exhibition, which opened in July 2022 at the Sordevolo Passion Museum in the Church of Santa Marta. Unlike the permanent collection, which recounts the tradition of popular theatre in Sordevolo for the performance of the Passion of Christ, the Phygital Exhibition focuses on documenting the activity related to the design and construction of the scenography. In the virtual environment, the physical space is replicated with a low level of detail to emphasize the VR exhibition, composed of a series of panels with the possibility to interact with historical documentation, drawings, and pictures. The virtual space is also enriched by video and 3D models not available in real space, which documents the transformation of the scenography over the years. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

E. C. Mater; L. Ö. Şahin,2023,An examination of the challenges and awareness presented by the transfer of born-digital records in the public sector: A case study of Türkiye,"In the Turkish public sector, official policy, and practice on the transfer of digital records to the Turkish State Archives has yet to be implemented, and the consequences of this have yet to be fully identified or comprehended. As such there is a need for research and recommendations on this problem. The purpose of this study is to provide a situational analysis of the transfer process of born-digital records to the national archives in Türkiye, by identifying the challenges faced in the digital transfer process, with the aim of raising awareness among public bodies. The survey method was used to collect data about the digital transfer process in Türkiye. A total of 120 public bodies participated in the survey. The originality value of this study can be said to be significant as of the target population, 120 Turkish public sector bodies were surveyed to determine their challenges and level of awareness regarding the born-digital transfer process. In addition to the high number of Turkish public bodies surveyed, this is the first study of its kind in Türkiye on digital transfer and its processes. The findings of the research revealed that public bodies in Türkiye are not currently ready for digital transfer. The findings also highlighted that the legal and technical infrastructure required for digital transfer in the public sector was inadequate. The research findings also concluded that staff working in the public sector require training in the processes related to the transfer of digital records. In line with the research data recommendations have been made regarding the digital transfer process in Türkiye. © The Author(s) 2023."

Nelson,2023,It’s Not Just GitHub: Identifying Data and Software Sources Included in Publications,"Paper publications are no longer the only form of research product. Due to recent initiatives by publication venues and funding institutions, open access datasets and software products are increasingly considered research products and URIs to these products are growing more prevalent in scholarly publications. However, as with all URIs, resources found on the live Web are not permanent. Archivists and institutions including Software Heritage, Internet Archive, and Zenodo are working to preserve data and software products as valuable parts of reproducibility, a cornerstone of scientific research. While some hosting platforms are well-known and can be identified with regular expressions, there are a vast number of smaller, more niche hosting platforms utilized by researchers to host their data and software. If it is not feasible to manually identify all hosting platforms used by researchers, how can we identify URIs to open-access data and software (OADS) to aid in their preservation? We used a hybrid classifier to classify URIs as OADS URIs and non-OADS URIs. We found that URIs to Git hosting platforms (GHPs) including GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge, and Bitbucket accounted for 33% of OADS URIs. Non-GHP OADS URIs are distributed across almost 50,000 unique hostnames. We determined that using a hybrid classifier allows for the identification of OADS URIs in less common hosting platforms which can benefit discoverability for preserving datasets and software products as research products for reproducibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

However, GHP URIs are vulnerable to the same reference rot that plagues the Web at large. The disappearance of software hosting platforms, like Gitorious and Google Code, and the source code they contain threatens research reproducibility. Archiving the source code and development history available in GHPs enables the long-term reproducibility of research. Software Heritage and Web archives contain archives of GHP URI resources. However, are the GHP URIs referenced by scholarly publications contained within the Software Heritage and Web archive collections? We analyzed a dataset of GHP URIs extracted from scholarly publications to determine (1) is the URI still publicly available on the live Web?, (2) has the URI been archived by Software Heritage?, and (3) has the URI been archived by Web archives? Of all GHP URIs, we found that 93.98% were still publicly available on the live Web, 68.39% had been archived by Software Heritage, and 81.43% had been archived by Web archives. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."

For archival documents, there are national and international norms and standards that advocate the use of Reliable Digital Archival Repositories. The object of this work introduces the premises of a trusted repository and its requirements and highlights the main repositories available in the area. Through an exploratory and qualitative research, three repositories will be analyzed, they are: Archivematica, Repository of Authentic Digital Objects and DSpace that are presented and evaluated regarding the requirements of a Reliable Digital Archival Repository. In the comparative research presented, it is observed that Archivematica and the Repository of Authentic Digital Objects are considered Reliable Digital Archival Repositories and DSpace is more used as a storage repository. Archivematica stands out for being the most used, in addition to the more extensive bibliography. It is concluded that in addition to the use of a Reliable Digital Archival Repository, it must be understood within a well-designed and widespread Digital Preservation Policy and combined with an access tool that is also compatible with archival standards and norms."
F. K. Ngongo; A. Bagula; O. Ajayi,2023,Archiving 4.0: Dataset Generation and Facial Recognition of DRC Political Figures Using Machine Learning,"It is widely recognized that digital archiving represents many advantages compared to manually preserved documents. These include i) reduced risk of losing data, ii) eco-friendliness, iii) data security, iv) faster access to data, v) simple data management, vi) overall costs saving, and vii) potential for data recovery. However, in contrast to developed nations, which have experienced a steady maturity in the field, digital archiving is still in its infancy in developing countries, especially in Africa, where years of slavery, colonization, both economic and political issues, and wars have deprived nations of their history. Building around techniques of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR), this paper addresses this gap by proposing a digital archiving model called “Archiving 4.0”. The model curates a dataset of images of political figures in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from different sources and classifies these images using machine learning techniques to achieve facial recognition that will help recognize historical people in photographs and videos. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed dataset constitutes the first attempt at digital archiving in the political space of the DRC and provides an example that can be emulated to spin out related works on the African continent where digital archiving is needed for political research studies and also for the preservation of the history of nations. Through performance evaluation, accuracy, precision, recall, and loss; the paper reveals that Transfer learning outperforms traditional machine learning on different metrics of interest when using the generated dataset: 93% of validation accuracy. © 2023, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."

Paletta,2023,Digital information management possible paths,"Introduction: Since its beginnings, society has sought to register its information and thus information technology tools occupy a prominent place in society, and are considered indispensable for scientific, social, technological and economic advancement. Objective: With this common thread, this article seeks to present a reflection on the concepts of Digital Information Management starting from the characteristics, problems and challenges of digital information. Methodology: The methodology consists of a bibliographic-documentary survey, composed of published materials, among them: books, theses, dissertations, texts on internet sites and articles in scientific journals, constituting a literature review, which mainly addresses works of expression in the area, published by authors who research the theme of digital information and its management, opening a way for new discussions on this theme. Results: In this way, the collected data are processed through qualitative analysis, and later, structured in thematic sections, point out the main theoretical mishaps. Conclusion: The results point to a major challenge that must be overcome for efficient data management, which are the existing restrictions on digital preservation both in terms of technology and software obsolescence, file formats, availability and perpetuity of repositories. Another issue that has to be considered is the one referring to the PGPD data protection legislation that imposes and regulates a series of rules for the recovery, treatment and use of personal information of natural individuals. © 2023 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

Ward,2023,CSD <i>Communications</i> of the Cambridge Structural Database,"The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) is a collection of over one million experimental three-dimensional structures obtained through crystallographic analyses. These structures are determined by crystallographers worldwide and undergo curation and enhancement by scientists at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) prior to their addition to the database. Though the CSD is substantial and contains widespread chemical diversity across organic and metal-organic compounds, it is estimated that a significant proportion of crystal structures determined are not published or shared through the peer-reviewed journal mechanism. To help overcome this, scientists can publish structures directly through the database as CSD Communications and these structural datasets are made publicly available alongside structures associated with scientific articles. CSD Communications contribute to the collective crystallographic knowledge as nearly two thirds are novel structures that are not otherwise available in the scientific literature. The primary benefits of sharing data through CSD Communications include the long-term preservation of scientific data, the strengthening of a widely data-mined world repository (the CSD), and the opportunity for scientists to receive recognition for their work through a formal and citable data publication. All CSD Communications are assigned unique digital object identifiers (DOIs). Contributions as CSD Communications currently comprise about 3.89% of the total CSD entries. Each individual CSD Communication is free to view and retrieve from the CCDC website."
G. Oberhiri-Orumah; E. E. Baro,2023,The extent of building and managing local contents in institutional repositories: a survey of tertiary institution libraries in Nigeria,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the development of institutional repositories (IR) in tertiary institution libraries in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a survey research method. Online questionnaire and IR site investigation methods were used to collect data from 25 university libraries in Nigeria. Findings: The study revealed that only 25 (14.7%) universities out of the 170 universities in Nigeria have successfully developed IRs and registered their presence in OpenDOAR. Other tertiary institutions such as Polytechnics and Colleges of Education investigated in Nigeria are yet to develop IRs. Contents such as theses and dissertations, conference proceedings and journal articles ranked highest being the most popular contents in the various IRs. The results showed that the development of IR saves space in the library, increases readership, increases access to local contents, minimizes damage to the original material, facilitates the dissemination of scholarly research and assists in globalization of Nigerian research findings. The IRs site investigation revealed that only few IRs have clearly defined access policy, content policy, submission policy and digital preservation policy. The study identified challenges such as inadequate facilities, unstable internet connectivity, lack of fund, irregular power supply, challenge of collecting materials for the IR, lack of skilled ICT personnel, copyright issues and absence of IR policies. Practical implications: The results from the study will provide important data and insight into the development of institutional repositories in tertiary institution libraries in Nigeria, and generate suggestions for University Librarians, College Librarians, Polytechnic Librarians, tertiary institutions management and policy makers for developing institutional repositories in Nigeria and other developing countries. Originality/value: The study investigated IR development in tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The findings will inform other tertiary institutions in developing countries that the development of IR provides an opportunity for the visibility of local contents emanating from institutions and make them see the reason to embrace this laudable development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Moreover, the U-Net-based method can extract puppet heads with multiple materials. However, the extraction of metal parts is inaccurate because of metal artefacts in the X-ray CT images and insufficient learning data. © 2023 The Author(s).

The relics of Taiwanese indigenous settlements with thousands history are widely distributed in deep forestry mountains with inconvenient transportation. Kapayuwanan is the original place of paiwan indigenous people. Firstly, UAV photogrammetry is applied for mapping supayuan settlement of 8 hectares and those stone houses invisible under dense forest are drawn by in-site investigation. Then UAV photogrammetry and LiDAR are used to document the larger area of Kapayuwanan of 36 hectares and terrestrial Lidar for the area of 1.2 hectares sorted out. It can not only obtain the accurate topography, landscape with architecture but also reveal the hidden settlements, such as roads, stone slab houses, irrigation landscape under the dense forest. Accuracy mapping is fundamental for future preservation planning and virtual conservation.Shaping the future is from revealing the Past. That is crucial to document, understand, and preserve the precious cultural heritage. Documenting with immediacy, high resolution, high manoeuvrability become possible because of the rapid developments of digital technologies in the recent two decades. It's astonishing, in the case of Taiwanese indigenous archaeological settlements sites, UAV photogrammetry and Lidar can successfully reveal the relics of stone slab houses in such a sever site-steep slopes, dense forestry with plantation in biodiversity. The reveal of settlements with reclaimed landscape verifies oral transmission of indigenous people as well . Digital technologies support the contention of archaeology, anthropology, heritage preservation, and cultural landscape, indispensable for revealing the past and shaping the future. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

J. A. Hodges; C. B. Trace,2023,"Preserving algorithmic systems: a synthesis of overlapping approaches, materialities and contexts","Purpose: This article aims to advance a multifaceted framework for preserving algorithms and algorithmic systems in an archival context. Design/methodology/approach: The article is based on a review and synthesis of existing literature, during which the authors observe emergent themes. After introducing these themes, the authors follow each theme as manifest in existing digital preservation projects, starting with algorithms' earliest conceptual starting points and moving up through themes' eventual implementation within a complex social environment. Findings: The authors find current literature is largely divided between that which addresses algorithms primarily as computational artifacts and that which views them instead as primarily social in nature. To bridge this gap the authors propose that “the algorithm,” as the algorithm is frequently deployed in popular discourse, is best understood as not as either the algorithm's technical or social components, but rather the sum total of both. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited by its methodology as a literature review. However, the findings point toward a new framing for future research that is less divided in terms of social or material orientation. Practical implications: Creating multifaceted records of algorithms, the authors argue, enables more effective regulation and management of algorithmic systems, which in turn help to improve their levels of fairness, accountability, and trustworthiness. Originality/value: The paper offers a wide variety of case studies with the potential to inform future studies, while contextualizing the studies together within a new framework that avoids prior limitations. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

McGonagill,2023,"PRESERVING the HISTORY of AFRICAN AMERICAN EDUCATION: DIGITAL DOCUMENTATION of ROSENWALD SCHOOLS-A CASE STUDY on the TANKERSLEY SCHOOL in HOPE HULL, ALABAMA, USA","Established across the American South between 1917 and 1932, Rosenwald Schools were crucial for providing education to African American children during segregation. Now, many of these structures are abandoned and deteriorating, in urgent need of digital documentation and preservation. This paper introduces an innovative approach for using Matterport technology to capture immersive virtual tours and enhance Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) with high-resolution imagery. The Tankersley Rosenwald School in Hope Hull, Alabama serves as the case study. Additionally, this paper features traditional Reality Capture techniques, such as Terrestrial Laser Scanning and aerial photogrammetry, in combination with Matterport technology to create a detailed HBIM model of the historic school. This model enables architectural and structural analysis, informing suitable stabilization, conservation, and restoration strategies. It also acts as a powerful visualization tool, allowing stakeholders to safely examine the school's architectural, structural, and historical aspects. The virtual tour produced through Matterport provides valuable data for developing an accurate HBIM model in Revit, leading to more effective conservation approaches. The integration of these technologies showcases the potential for digital preservation of built heritage and emphasizes the importance of innovative methods in cultural heritage documentation. By digitally preserving these historically significant schools, this research supports the conservation and restoration of a vital aspect of African American educational history and raises awareness of their cultural importance. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

J. Shivottam; S. Mishra,2023,Tirtha - An Automated Platform to Crowdsource Images and Create 3D Models of Heritage Sites,"Digital preservation of Cultural Heritage (CH) sites is crucial to protect them against damage from natural disasters or human activities. Creating 3D models of CH sites has become a popular method of digital preservation thanks to advancements in computer vision and photogrammetry. However, the process is time-consuming, expensive, and typically requires specialized equipment and expertise, posing challenges in resource-limited developing countries. Additionally, the lack of an open repository for 3D models hinders research and public engagement with their heritage. To address these issues, we propose Tirtha, a web platform for crowdsourcing images of CH sites and creating their 3D models. Tirtha utilizes state-of-the-art Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques. It is modular, extensible and cost-effective, allowing for the incorporation of new techniques as photogrammetry advances. Tirtha is accessible through a web interface at https://tirtha.niser.ac.in and can be deployed on-premise or in a cloud environment. In our case studies, we demonstrate the pipeline's effectiveness by creating 3D models of temples in Odisha, India, using crowdsourced images. These models are available for viewing, interaction, and download on the Tirtha website. Our work aims to provide a dataset of crowdsourced images and 3D reconstructions for research in computer vision, heritage conservation, and related domains. Overall, Tirtha is a step towards democratizing digital preservation, primarily in resource-limited developing countries. © 2023 ACM."

Costa,2023,Study on Contexts and Stages of Digital Content Curation Models: Guidelines for Use in Qualitative Analysis Software,"Researchers have shown interest in using software in scientific investigations, expanding literature review strategies in the organization, collection, analysis, and data triangulation. These aspects revealed possibilities for discussions related to digital content curation in Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS). The choice and organization of qualitative data in scientific research are affected by this complexity of information, which involves planning, contextualization, and ethical dilemmas of sharing, among other aspects that permeate the investigations. Thus, this study aims to contribute to the reflection and analysis of models of digital content curation that can be used in CAQDAS. A qualitative descriptive methodology was used to achieve this goal, made possible by a critical literature review of scientific works about digital content curation. It was based on searches in two academic databases (Scientific Electronic Library Online - SciELO - and Scopus) and two gray literature databases. As a result, few digital content curation models with similar stages are employed in different contexts, and that some authors are interested in reflecting on such models. It was also found that the digital content curation models can be redefined and explored based on specific guidelines that consider the context of the organization of qualitative data in CAQDAS."

K. Etemad; F. Samavati; P. Dawson,2023,Multi-scale physicalization of polar heritage at risk in the western canadian arctic,"The digital preservation of heritage resources has emerged as an essential method for communicating the significance of artifacts, buildings, and landscapes to descendant communities and the wider public. While virtual representations are becoming more commonplace, physical representations (physicalization) of heritage sites via 3D printing are used to a lesser degree. Physicalization provides new perspectives through the interplay between touch and vision and can facilitate a deeper understanding of the history being conveyed. This paper discusses how the physical models of heritage buildings and landscape features on Qikiqtaruk/Herschel Island Territorial Park were created from terrestrial laser scanning and UAV photogrammetry data. We demonstrate how to use this physicalization of polar heritage to communicate the significance of the buildings and landscape of the island to the local Indigenous communities and global audiences, as well as how they are being threatened by climate change. We also explore the transformation of a cove on the island into puzzles and data sculptures. In addition to the Cove, the fabricating of important buildings on larger scales has been a requirement. This multi-scale printing raises the issue of connecting the large-scale buildings with their small instances/copies on the Island (similar to focus + context visualization in the digital form). Due to the limitation of physicalization compared with digital representations, new methods, metaphors and designs are needed for supporting focus + context visualization. We have designed and implemented several such methods in our specific physicalization of heritage buildings and landscape on Qikiqtaruk/Herschel Island. We presented our physicalizations to the members of the Inuvialuit community of Aklavik NWT and received a positive response. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
K. May; J. S. Taylor; C. Binding,2023,Stratigraphic Analysis and The Matrix: connecting and reusing digital records and archives of archaeological investigations,"Stratigraphic data and relationships form the backbone of all the related archaeological records from each excavated site and, along with the phasing and interpretive information derived through stratigraphic analysis, are essential for chronological modelling, broader synthesis of inter-site phases and periods and, we argue in this paper and elsewhere, stratigraphic data should be a required component in digital archives of the growing body of archaeological information and reports generated through the commercial archaeological sector in the UK and internationally. Not every site has complex stratigraphy, but understanding the nature of the stratigraphy, be that deep or shallow, complex or otherwise, enables researchers to piece together the underlying details of how the excavator(s) arrived at the interpretations they have made about the site. The stratigraphic record, including associated relationships and data, which in the case of complex stratigraphy are usually visualized in the form of a stratigraphic matrix diagram, acts as a primary, if not the primary evidence for how, and in what order, the site was excavated. As such the stratigraphic data can be the key mechanism that enables anyone less familiar with the site, to re-visit and re-use the excavation records; understand what data is most relevant for addressing certain research questions; or grasp the nature of the chronological sequence encountered; and piece together the underlying details of how the excavator(s) arrived at their interpretations. However such records are often only held on paper or as scanned image copies (as PDFs) of matrix diagrams that cannot easily be re-used with all the associated data. This article presents outcomes from The Matrix project (AHRC AH/T002093/1) that address the current problems caused by the lack of standardized approaches to digital archiving of archaeological data using the case study of stratigraphic and phasing data. © 2023 Authors.

K. Perera,2023,Heritage at risk: Digital preservation of traditional cultural heritage (tch) in sri lanka,"Traditional cultural heritage (TCH) can be defined as diverse type of intangible and tangible heritage related to our ancestors in the ancient time such as cultures, beliefs, practices, ceremonies, indigenous knowledge etc. etc. Novel methods are being used to preserve the dying traditional knowledge in the field of medicine, agriculture, arts and sciences. Moreover, this can be treated as a part of the community and it belongs to the community. Furthermore, it is used in an informal way and practiced as a living heritage. Most of the time TCH has been transmitted orally from one person to another person or to a group of persons. This uniqueness helps to build cultural identity of TCH without undermining its cultural value. Thus, it is important to digitally preserve traditional cultural heritage with the help of novel technologies for the benefit of the present and future generations. With the emergence of new information technologies libraries, archives, museums and information centers have taken action to digitally preserve such priceless intangible and tangible heritage by way of collecting, organizing, managing and providing access to present and future generations as these heritages are at high risk. However, digital preservation is challenging task as it needs funds, trained staff, and the technology. Further, in this electronic era.There are various types of technologies that support for preservation of TCH. © 2023 K. Perera."
L. da Silva Batista; G. de Oliveira Souza; M. J. V. Jorente,2023,"Digital Curation in the postmodern social perspective: curatorial facets, concepts and participatory techniques","Information and Communication Technologies transform the spaces for presenting cultural heritage information and communication from brick-and-mortar spaces into hybrid environments: both on-site and digital-virtual. This transformation demands a more specific Digital Curation on the Web 2.0 context, platform on which participatory approaches emerge in the curatorial process, such as Social, Collective and Citizen Curations, which use crowdsourcing and storytelling. In this scenario, this article questions the difference between Digital Curation and other participatory curations which have emerged in postmodernity. The objective was to explore the Digital Curation facets in the participatory approach in the scope of Information Science. The scientific relevance of the paper was justified by the need for stakeholders’ participation in the curation of cultural contents and the necessary approach by Information Science. The methodology was qualitative in nature, theoretical and exploratory. The theoretical research was carried out on the proposed themes, and their similarities and differences were explored. Digital Curation expands by presenting new curatorial facets - Social, Citizen and Collective-, which present different levels of social involvement and can converge with each other, according to the objective of the proposed curation project.

L. Yuan; J. Kang; L. Feng; Z. Zhang; B. Wu,2023,Surface structured light sensor with simultaneous color mapping,"To obtain geometric information and color texture simultaneously, a surface structured light sensor consisting of a monochrome camera, a color camera, and a projector is proposed. The sensor uses a color camera to acquire surface color information while using it as a geometric measurement unit and matching with the monochrome camera to obtain geometric information. Due to the Bayer array and demosaicing algorithm of the color camera, pixel RGB components are always coupled with interference from other channels. However, existing color de-crosstalk in reconstruction is merely applied to the decoupling of color composite patterns, ignoring the intensity errors present in color fringe patterns under monochrome illumination. In our sensor, de-crosstalk of monochromatic patterns is considered to guarantee the reconstruction accuracy. The high-accuracy measurement of the sensor is validated by reconstructing standard steps, yielding a mean absolute error of 0.008 mm for distance measurements. In addition, the reconstruction experiment of a terracotta warrior verifies that the proposed sensor has potential application in the digital preservation of cultural relics. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd."

M. Aturban; M. Klein; H. Van de Sompel; S. Alam; M. L. Nelson; M. C. Weigle,2023,Hashes are not suitable to verify fixity of the public archived web,"Web archives, such as the Internet Archive, preserve the web and allow access to prior states of web pages. We implicitly trust their versions of archived pages, but as their role moves from preserving curios of the past to facilitating present day adjudication, we are concerned with verifying the fixity of archived web pages, or mementos, to ensure they have always remained unaltered. A widely used technique in digital preservation to verify the fixity of an archived resource is to periodically compute a cryptographic hash value on a resource and then compare it with a previous hash value. If the hash values generated on the same resource are identical, then the fixity of the resource is verified. We tested this process by conducting a study on 16,627 mementos from 17 public web archives. We replayed and downloaded the mementos 39 times using a headless browser over a period of 442 days and generated a hash for each memento after each download, resulting in 39 hashes per memento. The hash is calculated by including not only the content of the base HTML of a memento but also all embedded resources, such as images and style sheets. We expected to always observe the same hash for a memento regardless of the number of downloads. However, our results indicate that 88.45% of mementos produce more than one unique hash value, and about 16% (or one in six) of those mementos always produce different hash values. We identify and quantify the types of changes that cause the same memento to produce different hashes. These results point to the need for defining an archive-aware hashing function, as conventional hashing functions are not suitable for replayed archived web pages. © 2023 Aturban et al.

The collaboration's results included the dissemination of historical research and the digital documentation of buildings (carried out through the Scan-To-BIM process), which were intended to be pivotal events in the site's cultural rehabilitation. In order to prevent significant portions of a nation's history from being forgotten by the populace, historical recollections were thus encouraged. The purpose of this contribution is to use digital technologies to highlight the history of the most important area for the Brazil's Independence, which is situated in São Paulo on the banks of the Ipiranga stream, in the location where Dom Pedro I would have declared Brazil's independence from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves on September 7, 1822. The primary tasks established by the project's partners were the dissemination activities. They attempted to value the cultural characteristics of the location, dealing with both the preservation of memories and long-Term preservation of the monuments while always staying within the bounds of reliable science. The information gathered was subsequently put together in an online platform (in Portuguese language) that could explain the major outcomes and next steps to a larger audience (local population). © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

However, there is much that remains unknown, including how many OA books there are and to what degree they are included in preservation coverage. The purpose of this study is to contribute towards filling this knowledge gap in order to advance both research and practice in the domain of OA books.Design/methodology/approachThis study utilized open bibliometric data sources to aggregate a harmonized dataset of metadata records for OA books (data sources: the Directory of Open Access Books, OpenAIRE, OpenAlex, Scielo Books, The Lens, and WorldCat). This dataset was then cross-matched based on unique identifiers and book titles to openly available content listings of trusted preservation services (data sources: Cariniana Network, CLOCKSS, Global LOCKSS Network, and Portico). The web domains of the OA books were determined by querying the web addresses or digital object identifiers provided in the metadata of the bibliometric database entries.FindingsIn total, 396,995 unique records were identified from the OA book bibliometric sources, of which 19% were found to be included in at least one of the preservation services. The results suggest reason for concern for the long tail of OA books distributed at thousands of different web domains as these include volatile cloud storage or sometimes no longer contained the files at all.Research limitations/implicationsData quality issues, varying definitions of OA across services and inconsistent implementation of unique identifiers were discovered as key challenges.

M. Lorenz; M. Konečný,2023,Digital Archives as Research Infrastructure of the Future,"While a new paradigm of scientific research based on data centres and research infrastructures is gaining ground in science, and convergence between infrastructures and scientific domains is growing in cyberspace, epistemic cultures, particularly conservative in some fields, play a significant role in the dynamics of knowledge production in general and the adoption of data-intensive scientific practices in particular. In the present study, we focus on the transformations of scholarly communication through the perspective of digital curation of research data in the humanities, which certainly belong to these conservative epistemic cultures. The aim of this paper is to explore perspectives on the evolution of data curation in the context of the transformation of scholarly communication and research infrastructure in the humanities, specifically static archives, into living, continuously enriched data archives supported by artificial intelligence tools. To explore this perspective, we have chosen to compare scholarly communication in the humanities and in high-energy physics, in addition to analysing the practices of data curation itself. We further thematize the identified differences in terms of virtual research environments that can help humanities scholars exploit the potential of data-intensive research infrastructures. © 2023 by the author(s).

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the strengths and vulnerabilities of the cultural heritage sector and the need to accelerate its digital transformation to make the most of the opportunities it provides. The Commission Recommendation on the digitisation and online accessibility of cultural material and digital preservation (2011/711/EU) concluded that there is an urgent need to protect and preserve European cultural heritage, and, in particular, endangered cultural heritage is still present. However, the diversity of legal approaches to cultural heritage by the Member States discourages the creation of a common European data space for cultural heritage as the European Commission recently proclaimed. In Greece, there have been significant efforts in recent decades to digitise and digitally preserve cultural heritage goods. However, the attention was not drew upon the accessibility and reuse of the digitized cultural heritage content. According to the relevant regulatory framework the existing rules on the use of digital technologies for the reproduction, use and preservation of cultural heritage content is obviously outdated. According to the paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 46 of the Greek Code for the protection of antiquities and cultural heritage in general (Law 4858/2021), a previous permission granted by the Ministry of Culture is required for the production, reproduction and dissemination to the public of impressions, copies or depictions of monuments belonging to the Public Sector, or immovable monuments that are located within archaeological sites and historical places or are isolated, or movable monuments that are kept in museums or public collections, in any way and by any means whatsoever, including Information Communication Technologies. Such permission is granted to natural or legal persons for a fee paid to the Hellenic Organization of Cultural Resources Development (HOCRED) upon the decision of the Minister of Culture, while the decision also specifies the temporal validity of the permission, the terms on which the permission is granted and the fee that must be paid. The production, reproduction and use of the aforementioned goods for other purposes, such as artistic, educational or scientific purposes, is again allowed for a fee paid to HOCRED, however, the fee can be waived upon the decision of the Minister of Culture. This Paper will examine the existing Greek legal framework and will attempt to propose an appropriate framework that will ensure open access to the digitized cultural heritage assets, enhance the recovery and transformation of the cultural heritage sector and support cultural heritage institutions in becoming more empowered and more resilient in the future. © 2023, The Author(s)."
M. Polchow,2023,Integrating preservation into librarian workflows,"The core mission of libraries is to ensure perpetual access to the record of knowledge. As a review of the NASIG webinar (formerly North American Serials Interest Group), 'Integrating Preservation into Librarian Workflows', by Jill Emery and Sunshine Carter, this article examines working models constructed to sustain perpetual access for their institutional communities. In reflecting on these data-intensive practices, both presenters now recognize that previously impactful collection development business decisions were being made in the dark. Reviewing the webinar also reveals that this issue of preservation access has two critically distinct aspects, which should not be conflated as interchangeable. One is concerned with long-term preservation and the other addresses a library's ability to provide post-cancellation access to its user community, given budgetary or physical space constraints. The following is an analysis of how effective the processes explored in the webinar are in addressing both post-cancellation access and long-term perpetual access goals. Based on a 2018 NASIG survey, results indicated that many organizations in scholarly communications lacked preservation policies. In June 2022, as a result of the survey, NASIG released the model digital preservation policy as a template to guide consequential and explicit decision-making by addressing issues including scope, roles, responsibilities, tools and techniques. These policy issues are important for librarians to understand before negotiating content licenses, in sustaining long-term discovery and access, and when developing collaborative access frameworks to address collection development and maintenance challenges. © 2023 Michelle Polchow."

M. Vuković; T. Štefanac,2023,"Digital Cultural Heritage, Cybersecurity, and the Human Factor","Digital heritage, with its intellectual and cultural identity value, constitutes a significant asset. This also makes it an important asset in the cyber market. Cultural heritage institutions, recognising the vital role of digital assets, confront various information security risks and must adopt cyber threat related strategies to counter potential cyber-attacks. This paper first investigates the susceptibility of digital heritage objects to cyber threats by examining their distinctive characteristics. The study subsequently poses research enquiries concerning the cybersecurity proficiency and general awareness of cultural heritage professionals. A conducted survey in Croatia among these professionals analyses their information and computer practices related to the storage and preservation of digital cultural heritage. Findings reveal that while overall cybersecurity awareness is commendable, there exists a deficiency in cybersecurity and data protection training among cultural heritage professionals, even at the basic level. Additionally, the study highlights insufficient technical support and equipment for cybersecurity within cultural heritage institutions. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

Ismail,2023,Intangible Cultural Dance Preservation Using Virtual Reality 360-Degree Video,"Virtual Reality provides users with an unparalleled sense of presence, making them feel as if they are physically present in the virtual environment. It enables the digital preservation of cultural artifacts and artworks beyond conventional methods. Cultural artworks including cultural dance that descended from ancestors are increasingly forgotten. The younger generation is unaware of the value of carrying on the predecessors' legacies. VR experiences through 360-degree video may encourage future generations to explore and learn about their cultural heritage. Thus, introducing a VR 360-degree video for cultural preservation is proposed in this study. This paper presents the usage of virtual reality, the development of 360-degree videos, and an evaluation study to determine how well young people might use the videos. The 360-degree VR video followed stepwise approach in video production processes from pre-production, production, and to post-production. A software usability scale (SUS) was adopted to assess how usable this video is among youngsters. Fifty participants were involved in the testing. The result showed that the 360-degree VR video has an acceptable level of usability. This study has generally demonstrated that virtual reality has a positive outcome that could result in a larger and more extensive deployment for cultural heritage preservation activities. © 2023 IEEE."
N. Pintarić; D. Vujević,2023,OPEN RESEARCH DATA IN THE FIELD OF ARCHAEOLOGY,"Aim. Open research data is becoming an important factor in the research process in all scientific disciplines, including archaeology, which is the subject of this paper. Thereby, they are also part of the process of forming new knowledge. The aim of this research is to identify and describe the factors shaping research data related to archeology and Open science that can influence the improvement of the quality of open research data for the purpose of their reuse in new research and within the archaeological community. Approach/methodology/design. The research was conducted using the method of content analysis of the available articles and publications resulting from the scientific research and projects in the field of archeology and Open science. Findings. The research and content analysis of relevant articles indicated the most significant determinants of research data and the tradition of applying digital technology in archaeology. Through the research, seven stages of the application of digital technology were defined, which can be perceived as degrees of maturity of the application of digital technology. Open research data and their reuse are of interest to the research community as well as to the wider community. The research data factors in archeology were identified as follows: archaeological data, archaeological record, life cycle of research data, digital object, structured and linked open data, citation of open research data, digital repository and quality of open research data. For each of the mentioned factors, individual phenomena were investigated, described and connected. The process is important because it is the only way to ensure users’ trust in research data for reuse, that is, to ensure the necessary level of quality of open research data. Further areas of research were identified with regard to the granularity of the permanent identifier in the field of archeology and dimensions of the quality of research data for reuse. Research limitations. Within this research, only the works published in Croatian or English were considered, so the results of relevant research presented in other languages were not included. The research on open research data is in its early stage in many countries. Most of the research that has been carried out and published in publications in the field of archeology is based on case studies or on convenient samples. This research did not explore metadata in more detail. Practical implications. The creation of open research data requires the involvement of researchers or experts from the field of archaeology as well as from information sciences. The results of this research can help them understand the application of digital technology and improve the process of creating, storing, long-term preservation, sharing, and reusing open research data. Originality/value. The research on open research data in Croatia is in its initial stage. There is a lack of studies on how to create open research data and how to reuse them. This paper contributes to expanding knowledge about the digital workflow of storing research data in archaeology, the factors that shape open research data, and the dimensions of quality for their reuse. © 2023, Hrvatsko Knjiznicarsko Drustvo.

N. Sheriff; R. Sevukan,2023,Discovering research data management trends from job advertisements using a text-mining approach,"In today’s data-driven culture, research data management (RDM) is essential for the research community. The demand for reusing research datasets is a challenging and diverse process for the scientific community. Despite this, it is essential in RDM to discover trends and themes using text mining, which is scarce. The purpose of this study is to employ text mining to discover insights from job advertisements associated with RDM profiles, which collected 810 advertisements. We found RDM-related patterns using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and identified three key contexts. The first is ‘research services in libraries’, with the topics of research services, research information, research universities, collection processes and library services. The second context is ‘research data’, which includes RDM, business data, university data, research data, health research, science research, social science research, data centres, data services, statistical software, digital scholarship and digital preservation. The third context is ‘workplace environment’, and the topics are leadership, work development and scientific position. Job title normalisation reveals names such as ‘data librarian’, ‘librarian’, ‘director’, ‘data curator’, ‘data manager’, ‘research data librarian’, ‘data specialist’ and ‘data officer’ are frequently employed. Focusing on titles with a single or double occurrence is new and interesting for developing nations. Reputable institutions such as Harvard, Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, are the major participants in RDM practises and services. This discovery will assist higher education institutions, RDM stakeholders, which aid in the formulation of curriculum, and job seekers to familiarise themselves with the themes. © The Author(s) 2023."
P. Aftabi; S. F. N. Bahramjerdi,2023,Developing a decision-making framework within the management of historical cities: Towards integrated conservation and development of the Roudaki neighbourhood,"Urban management is fraught with challenges, particularly when it comes to devising a decision-making system that is efficient and broadly supported by all stakeholders. This procedure is considerably more demanding in urban heritage administration, involving a diverse range of conservation and development actors. In addition, with cities and urban regions becoming more complex in recent decades, governments are increasingly seeking to understand the significance of cultural heritage in encouraging long-term sustainable development initiatives. Following these concerns, this paper extensively analyses the relevant literature to create a theoretical decision-making framework for the integrated conservation and development of heritage cities. Through both quantitative and qualitative methods, this research investigates decision-making strategies by analysing the tactics, actions, and impacts of conservation and development initiatives in the Roudaki neighbourhood, with a particular emphasis on the perspectives of key participants in the process. Upon identifying research indicators using the theoretical framework, this study adopts a quantitative methodology to collect questionnaires from three influential groups of actors. This phase is carried out by calculating correlations between variables in SPSS in order to delve into the connections between the research's criteria in a specific case study, resulting in a detailed analytical framework for the classification of decision-making priorities in district administration. To proceed to the qualitative stage, semi-structured interviews were arranged with urban officials to get a sense of the district's current state and to conduct a comparative analysis of the collected data from both phases of the research. The results suggest that while participatory decision-making approaches and integrated management techniques can be beneficial for urban heritage administration, it is essential to identify the decision-making priorities and resolve inconsistencies between implemented policies and actors' demands and perceptions. Accordingly, this procedure unifies conflicting interests, facilitates the proper execution of integrated management strategies, and ensures the long-term preservation of historical cities. © 2023"

Lazzeretti,2023,The role of digital technologies for culture-driven local development in Europe: A policy review,"The use of new technologies in the digital age has transformed the ways of producing, preserving, and participating in the cultural heritage of the territories. Consequently, the culture-driven approach to local development takes on a hybrid dimension, where culture, local and digital development interrelate in physical and digital spaces. The research aims to identify the themes in which the EU’s policies for cultural heritage, local development, and digital transformation meet to understand the areas in which the use of new technological applications for culture-driven local development is supported in Europe. To do that, a qualitative investigation of policies was conducted using NVivo 14. The results show that the EU policies recognize the importance of enhancing the local tourist experience through digital cultural content, the digital preservation of the local cultural heritage, and the participation in cultural heritage in the digital space. © 2023, eum - Edizioni Universita di Macerata.

P. Chintan; J. Gohil,2023,Between quandary and squander: an analysis of preservation practices of vernacular literature at university libraries,"Purpose Vernacular materials present stories of different cultures and people. Management of these resources is not just about storing records for history and research; they also represent the democratic credentials of the government. Libraries play a crucial role here. The purpose of this study is to look into the existing preservation practices at university libraries, such as digitisation. Design/methodology/approach This study has applied descriptive research methods for the systematic literature analysis along with structured questionnaires for the primary data collection. The research sample was 50 university libraries spread in different provinces in India. Findings The analysis critically describes the strategies of implementing the preservation practices and factors of deterioration of the old and rare materials. The findings of the study revealed that the majority of the university libraries are using digitisation of rare materials, and binding, de-acidification and pest control were common practices of restoration. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, based on the literature analysis, the primary investigation and research gap indicated that no attempts have been made to explore the digitisation practice and other restoration approaches among university libraries. Preservation practices vary from case to case; however, such common practices at these university libraries provide evidence-based examples which is useful for the larger group of people to choose more suitable conservation techniques. This study will help researchers of conservationists to identify the factors of preservation and conservation practices at university libraries in India in special respect to the rare vernacular literature."
P. Derudas; F. Nurra; A. Svensson,2023,New AIR for the Archaeological Process?

Methods: Two qualitative perspectives are considered in the case study: the practice turn and the perspective of the study of behavior and informational practices to study the strategy and informational interactions of the collaboration model developed between a research center with more than 200 integrated researchers (CHAM – Center for the Humanities) and the specialized Digital Development of Research Services (DDRS) team from the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of Universidade NOVA de Lisboa. Methods such as document analysis, observation and analysis of informational practices were used. Results: The collaboration model is analyzed in its main strategic characteristics and informational practices: active and continuous dialogue between the research community, supported by DDRS coaching activities, focused on obtaining a generalized but flexible consensus around the research, digital curation, and preservation. Its implementation results from a double Top-down strategy, guaranteeing organizational support and information governance, and Bottom-up, constituting a community-led process, developing two interrelated actions: a pilot data management test experience and the evaluation collection of research project sites with recommendations for their sustainability, interoperability, digital preservation, and curation. Conclusions: The construction of the strategy centered on shared critical reflection perspective of joint solutions and synergies for the construction of participatory digital preservation policies. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

P. Zippert; F. Binder; T. Hausotte,2023,Preserving Fragile History: Assessing the Feasibility of Segmenting Digitized Historical Documents with Modulation Depth Analysis,"Historical documents are often severely damaged, making it impossible to open them manually without causing further damage. To address this challenge, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-destructive method to explore the inside in a different way. However, the use of ionising radiation in CT scanning raises concerns about its impact on fragile historical documents. This study presents a methodology that uses a test object to conduct preliminary investigations to evaluate the capability of a CT scanner for digital preservation of historical documents. By assessing the feasibility and determining the setting parameters in advance, the X-ray exposure to historical documents can be minimised. For this purpose, a large dataset of inter-page distances was obtained from CT scans of a specially developed test object. The results obtained show a consistent correlation between the page-to-page distances and the derived modulation depths. This method offers great potential for assessing the separability of the pages of historical documents even before they are exposed to radiation for digitisation. Overall, this study helps to reduce the impact of X-ray radiation on sensitive historical documents during digitisation using CT, with the aim of preserving this fragile cultural heritage for future generations. © 2023 by the authors."

R. A. Tabib; D. Hegde; T. Anvekar; U. Mudenagudi,2023,DeFi: Detection and Filling of Holes in Point Clouds Towards Restoration of Digitized Cultural Heritage Models,"In this paper, we propose DeFi: a novel perspective for hole detection and filling of a given deteriorated 3D point cloud towards digital preservation of cultural heritage sites. Preservation of heritage demands digitization as cultural heritage sites deteriorate due to natural calamities and human activities. Digital preservation promotes acquisition of 3D data using 3D sensor or Multi-view reconstruction. Unfortunately, 3D data acquisition finds challenges due to the limitations in sensor technology and inappropriate capture conditions, leading to formation of missing regions or holes in the acquired point cloud. To address this, we propose a pipeline consisting of detection of hole boundaries, and understanding the geometry of the hole boundaries to fill the region of the point cloud. Recent research on hole detection and filling fails to generalize on complex structures such as heritage sites, as they find challenges in differentiating between the hole boundary and non-hole boundary points. To address this, we propose to detect boundary points of point cloud and learn to classify them into hole boundary""and ""non-hole boundary""points. We generate a synthetic dataset based on ModelNet40 to learn the detection of hole boundaries. We demonstrate the results of the proposed pipeline on (i) ModelNet40 dataset, (ii) Heritage 3D models generated via photogrammetry, and compare the results with state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 IEEE."""

R. Ahmad; M. Rafiq,2023,Digital preservation practices for information resources in university libraries of Pakistan,"Purpose: The digital contents (d-contents) are vulnerable to various threats either natural or manmade. Digital preservation is the plethora of a wide array of strategies necessary for the long-term preservation of digital objects. This study was carried out to assess the digital preservation practices for information resources in university libraries of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey based on a structured questionnaire was carried out to conduct the study. The questionnaire containing two sets of strategies (general and technical) was distributed amongst the whole population and received 90% response rate. Findings: Overall, progressive implementation of general digital preservation practices was noted in these libraries like checking the digital collections for viruses, keeping the digital media in fire/water/theft proof locations, restricting unauthorized access, maintaining ideal humidity and temperature, and checking the digital media for functionality. Amongst the technical practices, only replication was in practice at a progressive rate, followed by metadata recording and media refreshing that was sometimes practiced in these libraries. The other technical practices were rarely or never practiced in these libraries. Significant variances in general and technical digital preservation practices were noted based on their physical locations (regional distribution). Research limitations/implications: The study contributes a comprehensive set of digital preservation practices divided into general and technical types to conduct similar studies in other parts of the world. Practical implications: The findings stress the need for national and institutional policies, funding streams and skill enhancement of library staff.

R. Ahmad; M. Rafiq,2023,Global perspective on digital preservation policy: A systematic review,"Policy provides a roadmap for actions to be taken in any task. It plays an important role in successful implementation of any program. Similarly, the presence of policy also plays a key role in implementation of digital preservation program. The organizations having such policy hold an edge for carrying out their digital preservation activities in an organized manner. This paper provides an explicit overview regarding preparedness of libraries and other organizations across the world in terms of availability of policies for digital preservation. The paper also attempts to map the data geographically. The empirical studies were reviewed systematically, and the extracted data was synthesized for producing meaningful insight about this phenomenon. The meta-analysis affirms that libraries and other organizations seem to have realization about importance of policies for implementation of digital preservation program. Although some studies highlight the availability of digital preservation policies in a good number of organizations yet, as a whole, most of the studies point out passive organizational attitude toward the development of such policies. The data mapping affirms that the studies conducted worldwide and North American region show a satisfactory situation in terms of availability of digital preservation policies. However, the studies conducted in European countries, African region, China, and New Zealand identify a gap regarding presence of such policies. © The Author(s) 2022."

R. Gadot; D. Tsybulsky,2023,Digital Curation as a Pedagogical Approach to Promote Critical Thinking,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education aims to develop creative, broadminded, and inquisitive graduates who think critically. Critical thinking (CT) is conceptualized as purposeful, self-regulatory judgment involving thinking skills such as analysis, evaluation, and inference. This research, designed as an exploratory study, presents a theoretical digital curation (DC) model enabling a comprehensive pedagogical framework for developing and utilizing CT in a digital environment in higher education. The database was composed of digital collections created by undergraduate and graduate students (n = 94) from three Israeli universities. The research questions were: (1) whether and in what ways the engagement of students in the DC activity required CT, (2) whether a significant difference in the level of CT would be found between undergraduate and graduate students in the DC activity, (3) whether a significant difference in the level of CT would be found between students provided with instruction on DC before the DC activity and a control group that received no instruction. Factor analysis of the students’ strategies produced 3 factors corresponding to evaluation, analysis, and inference that accounted for 75.34% of the total explained variance. These results suggest that as a pedagogical approach, DC can tap the key features of CT. Further statistical analyses showed that the graduate students had higher scores on evaluation than the undergraduates and that academic level and previous instruction in DC improved the quality of the DC. The factor that most influenced the quality of the digital curation was the analysis variable. Thus, DC can create a rich, active environment that promotes CT. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Vigliermo,2023,"Knowledge extraction, management and long-term preservation of non-Latin cultural heritages - Digital Maktaba project presentation","The services provided by today’s cutting-edge digital library systems may benefit from new technologies that can improve cataloguing efficiency and cultural heritages preservation and accessibility. Below, we introduce the recently started Digital Maktaba (DM) project, which suggests a new model for the knowledge extraction and semi-automatic cataloguing task in the context of digital libraries that contain documents in non-Latin scripts (e.g. Arabic). Since DM involves a large amount of unorganized data from several sources, particular emphasis will be placed on topics such as big data integration, big data analysis and long-term preservation. This project aims to create an innovative workflow for the automatic extraction of information and metadata and for a semi-automated cataloguing process by exploiting Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and data management techniques to provide a system that is capable of speeding up, enhancing and supporting the librarian’s work. We also report on some promising results that we obtained through a preliminary proof of concept experimentation. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."

Giannoukou,2023,Digital transition strategies and training programs for digital curation of museum,"Small and medium-sized museums have been particularly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as they often have limited resources and staff to manage the challenges posed by the pandemic. In order for them to survive during the pandemic but also embracing the extensive use of technology in our everyday lives, museums have to adapt to this new reality. The aim of the Museum-Next project is to provide small and medium-sized museums with a new generation of specialised EU professionals working in the Cultural Heritage sector, equipped with a recognised, cross-cutting and high-level digital skillset: The Digital Curators. In the digital age, museum digital curators play a critical role in preserving, organising, and presenting museum collections online. As part of the project, our research performed a desk analysis on the state of the art on museum digital transition strategies and museum digital curator training programs already implemented at EU scale in order to map good practices and tools already existing so as to highlight the current situation and the gaps that may appear in the topic. © 2023 R.

R. Shiozaki,2023,Existential dependence relations of documents in the context of preservation,"Purpose: This paper re-examines the ontology of documents, especially digital ones, in the context of preservation, which presumes the actual existence of things. It also explores which aspects of documents are retained or lost over the course of time. Design/methodology/approach: This study detangles the complexities of existential dependence relations of documents, by selectively reviewing literature on digital preservation, document theory, John Searle's social ontology, Maurizio Ferraris' documentality, and Amie Thomasson's categorial ontology. Findings: The author argues that (1) existing objects can be documents, insofar as perceivers regard them as such; (2) documents are social objects as they depend on other objects, including creators, perceivers, and other documents; and (3) preserving digital documents entails the curation of dependence relations since they inherently have technologically dependent relations. Practical implications: A clarification of the existential dependence relations of documents can aid documentary heritage institutions in determining preservation goals and strategies. Future research must address how, and to what extent, such dependence relations can be curated. Originality/value: This paper clarifies that the preservation of documents entails the curation of dependence relations, and the critical issue in preservation is how to best preserve the dependence relations of documents, especially since digital documents available on the Internet inherently have technological and dynamic dependence relations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

S. Aizada; B. Arshad,2023,Knowledge Graphs in Healthcare,"The healthcare domain has many analytical applications with genomic and clinical datasets. The relationships between the genomic and clinical datasets can be easily represented as graphs using nodes and edges. Biological concepts such as genes and chromosomes can be organized relatively modestly using taxonomical hierarchies and, in turn, giving us knowledge graphs. This gives immediate benefits in terms of the knowledge which can be extracted from the datasets using graph algorithms and machine learning techniques. Furthermore, exploiting knowledge graphs for decision-making processes based on the provenance of datasets provides a deeper understanding and knowledge of the processes involved and generates trust in the results. We frame our discussion around unifying the representation of a human genome and its variations using graphs and then organizing the data into knowledge graphs for different applications. We also discuss how knowledge graphs find their intrinsic value when integrating clinical datasets for the long-term preservation of data and clinical reporting. We also note potential avenues for future work within the field of genomics and clinical data science. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Sanju Tiwari, Fernando Ortíz-Rodriguez, Sarra Ben Abbés, Patience Usoro Usip and Rim Hantach; individual chapters, the contributors."
S. Akau; J. McKinney; R. McNellis,2023,PREFERRED PRESERVATION FORMATS FOR DIGITAL MUSIC SCORES: A SURVEY OF UNIVERSITY MUSIC FACULTY,"Digitally notated music scores are widely created and distributed. But the collaborative nature of the online environment and variety of file formats and software choices, both proprietary and open-source, present unique challenges for archivists when it comes to sharing, preserving, and providing access to these digital scores now and into the future. This article addresses the advantages and disadvantages of file formats for digital notated music scores that offer the greatest potential for long-term preservation, sustainability, and future accessibility. These formats, outlined in the Library of Congress’s Recommended Formats Statement, are MusicXML, the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) schema, and PDF/ UA/A. The authors conducted a survey of eighty-nine music professors at twenty-two universities to determine the extent to which they utilize these different file formats as well as digital preservation best practices in their work. All respondents who create musical scores use digital notation software. While most utilize PDF and discuss this format with their students, far fewer use MusicXML and MEI. Only 46 percent were aware of the principles of digital preservation. The article concludes with a detailed analysis of the results from this survey, which revealed ways in which information professionals can educate faculty about responsible measures that will ensure the long-term accessibility and research potential of digital music scores in an ever-changing digital world. © 2023 Music Library Association.

S. Allegrezza,2023,Web and Social Media as new Sources for History,"This paper aims at highlighting how interest in the issues of web and social media archiving and preservation has grown enormously, in parallel with the awareness of the importance of these ‘resources’ as privileged sources for reconstructing the history of our era. How will the historians of the future be able to reconstruct the historical period we are living through if memory institutions are not able to archive and preserve the websites and social media of institutions, public bodies, parties, associations, government bodies, political figures, and famous people in general, given that everything is now conveyed through these channels? The fragility of the web, then, would require immediate action and the launch of ‘web and social media archiving’ initiatives without delay, on pain of the disappearance of all that has been made available online in recent years, but on this point the situation in Italy-with a few exceptions-appears to lag far behind other European countries and enormously behind the Anglo-Saxon countries. There is therefore an urgent need to launch initiatives to raise awareness on these issues and to train the skills and professionalism required to conduct web and social media archiving and preservation projects. © 2023, University of Bologna Department of Classical and Italian Philology, Alma Mater Studiorum.

S. Ferro; M. Pelillo; A. Traviglia,2023,Ai-Assisted digitalisation of historical documents,"Preserving historical archival heritage involves not only physical measures to safeguard these valuable texts but also providing for their digital preservation. However, merely digitising manuscripts and codexes is not enough. A further step is needed: The digitalisation of their content, i.e.The verbatim transcription of scanned texts. This process enables the accurate preservation of their textual content, making it easier to search for information and conduct further analyses. With the help of artificial intelligence, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), automatic handwriting recognition can be performed. In this study, we employed a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), an established type of DNN, to determine the minimum amount of labelled data required to automatically transcribe five different historical datasets that vary in language and time period. The results show that a Character Error Rate (CER) lower than 10% can be achieved with just a few hundred labelled text lines in almost all cases. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

S. Govindraj; P. Ranade; T. Goswami,2023,Proposal of an ARVR-Enabled Digital Archive: Preserving Archaeological Data Through Emerging Technologies,"Archaeology is the field of study that aims at identifying and understanding human existence and past cultures through ancient remnants. Ideally, a significant amount of information in this division is gathered through analysing and studying the existing artefacts found during excavations through a different set of manuals as well as tech-based procedures. There are three stages of archaeology that are of utmost importance, the primary one being field investigation and identification of the site, the second stage comprising the actual excavation and the tertiary stage encompasses data gathering, evaluation and retrieval of artefact along with ensuring that it is safely transported to the final destination. There is a demand for immense workforce, funds and high-tech machines during this process. Archaeology is a vast domain branching into different sectors such as landscape, nautical, primatology, biblical, and paleo archaeology, among others. Each of these sectors has its own set of challenges, the one being common to all is the need to preserve and conserve the procured data so that it can be accessed easily at any point in time with minimal effort. This paper aims to propose a virtual design concept for archaeologists and history buffs that allows the digital preservation of archaeological data with the help of emerging technologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023."

ALBERT RIVER LOTS),"Climate change has become, among countless pressures, a dominant threat to heritage places. It is critical to identify, analyse, assess, and mitigate immediate risks, and manage unforeseeable, unavoidable, and adverse impacts of climate on heritage values. There is an urgency in the heritage field to identify practical, efficient, and repeatable ways to document and monitor the condition of diverse heritage resources and develop climate adaptation strategies. Digital technologies, cloud computing, and digital preservation of heritage places can play a vital role in support of condition assessment, conservation planning, and sustainable management of heritage resources. This paper discusses a pilot project that experiments with the application of this idea on a selected case study, St. Albert River Lots in Alberta, Canada, and examines the challenges and opportunities of employing Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other Cloud-based applications. The project aimed to prepare a 3D model, as a foundation for recording current conditions and a tool for monitoring the impacts of climate change on heritage aspects and values in order to assist with the preparation of a detailed conservation management plan for the place in a digital format and contribute to the interpretive programming activities and raising public awareness. © 2023 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Duller,2023,XLUM: an open data format for exchange and long-term preservation of luminescence data,"The concept of open data has become the modern science meme, and major funding bodies and publishers support open data. On a daily basis, however, the open data mandate frequently encounters technical obstacles, such as a lack of a suitable data format for data sharing and long-term data preservation. Such issues are often community-specific and best addressed through community-tailored solutions. In Quaternary sciences, luminescence dating is widely used for constraining the timing of event-based processes (e.g. sediment transport). Every luminescence dating study produces a vast body of primary data that usually remains inaccessible and incompatible with future studies or adjacent scientific disciplines. To facilitate data exchange and long-term data preservation (in short, open data) in luminescence dating studies, we propose a new XML-based structured data format called XLUM. The format applies a hierarchical data storage concept consisting of a root node (node 0), a sample (node 1), a sequence (node 2), a record (node 3), and a curve (node 4). The curve level holds information on the technical component (e.g. photomultiplier, thermocouple). A finite number of curves represent a record (e.g. an optically stimulated luminescence curve). Records are part of a sequence measured for a particular sample. This design concept allows the user to retain information on a technical component level from the measurement process. The additional storage of related metadata fosters future data mining projects on large datasets. The XML-based format is less memory-efficient than binary formats; however, its focus is data exchange, preservation, and hence XLUM long-term format stability by design. XLUM is inherently stable to future updates and backwards-compatible. We support XLUM through a new R package xlum, facilitating the conversion of different formats into the new XLUM format. XLUM is licensed under the MIT licence and hence available for free to be used in open- and closed-source commercial and non-commercial software and research projects."
S. Liu; H. Feng; W. Zhou,2023,Rethinking Supervision in Document Unwarping: A Self-consistent Flow-free Approach,"In recent years, the proliferation of smartphones has led to an upsurge in the digitization of document files via these portable devices. However, images captured by smartphones often suffer from distortions, thereby negatively affecting digital preservation and downstream applications. To address this issue, we introduce DRNet, a novel deep network for document image rectification. Our approach is based on three key designs. Firstly, we exploit the intrinsic geometric consistency inherent in document images to guide the learning process of distortion rectification. Secondly, we design a coarse-to-fine rectification network to leverage the representations derived from the distorted document image, thereby enhancing the rectification result. Thirdly, we propose a unique perspective for supervising the learning of rectification networks, where undistorted document images are employed for supervision, which is free of warping mesh as ground truth in existing methods. Technically, both low-level pixel alignment and high-level semantic alignment jointly contribute to the learning of the mapping relationship between deformed document images and distortion-free ones. We evaluate our method on the challenging DocUNet Benchmark dataset, where it sets a series of state-of-the-art records, demonstrating the superiority of our approach compared to existing learning-based solutions. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive series of ablation experiments to further validate the effectiveness and merits of our method. IEEE"

Objective: The research described in this article sought to identify Digital Curation actions being implemented by the Institutions that are part of the Brazilian Network of Studies and Adapted Collections (REBECA). Methodology: As for the methodological procedures, it was characterized as descriptive research, with a quantitative and qualitative approach. As a data collection instrument, a questionnaire was applied, with seventeen questions, elaborated based on the DCC & U digital curation lifecycle model. Results: It was found that curatorship or digital preservation actions are not performed uniformly across the Network. However, although there is no standardization, all actions that are configured as stages of the digital curation life cycle were identified in at least one HEI, the most frequent being: community participation and monitoring and the description and representation of information, through the specification and attribution of metadata to the produced accessible digital objects. Conclusion: Digital curation and preservation are still emerging issues in the Network's discussions, even though many of the actions present in the curatorship lifecycle models are already carried out in the production process of Accessible Digital Objects."

Pravin Savaridass,2023,AI Based Tamil Palm Leaf Character Recognition,"An extensive study aimed at analyzing characters from old Tamil manuscripts written on palm leaves corresponds to Tamil Palm Leaf Character Recognition. These culturally and historically valuable manuscripts require extensive processing in order to effectively extract characters because they are frequently affected by chronological and degradation. The process begins with the capturing of a clear photograph of the manuscript, which is then preprocessed to remove imperfections like stains and smudges. Before preprocessing, the digitalized manuscripts are cropped vertically into three parts to improve the preprocessing quality. To remove color differences and compress the data, the image is converted to grayscale. subsequently noise is removed using specialized filtering algorithms. The image is refined through further morphological processes, which fill in small gaps and blurs character borders. Binarization makes it easier to distinguish the characters from the surroundings. Line segmentation is applied to the previously divided image to separate out individual lines of text for improved character recognition. Finally, the preprocessed scripts are trained by using CNN model. In the proposed model the Tamil characters are effectively recognized with an accuracy of 91%, and resulting in the digital preservation and comprehension of these precious palm leaf written works. © 2023 IEEE."
S. Xiong; W. Yang,2023,The Application of Digital Virtual Images in the Protection and Dissemination of Cultural Heritage,"Digital resources, as an effective means of digital storage, can be preserved for a long time. On the one hand, it provides high-quality data sources for the implementation of salvage protection of intangible cultural heritage. On the other hand, it can compensate for the problems of resource heterogeneity, single storage method, and currently undefined protection level and priority in the rescue protection of intangible cultural heritage. Due to the complexity of intangible cultural heritage and the liveliness of its cultural space, ensuring the long-term preservation, visibility, and readability of digital images is a problem that image recorders need to consider. In the process of transforming dynamic cultural heritage into digital images, it is necessary to restore and reproduce the original ecological behavior of intangible cultural heritage. This article explores how digital imaging can be applied to the protection of intangible cultural heritage. Through the virtual reality technology integration of computer graphics, multimedia, digital animation, network communication and modern technology cloud storage service system, real scenes and virtual objects are superimposed in real time, and innovation is the inheritance and development of intangible cultural heritage solutions. © 2023, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

T. Qi; L. Ma; W. Zhou; L. Dai,2023,"Traditional village digital archival conservation: a case study from Gaoqian, China","Archiving in traditional villages has been carried out for nearly 20 years in China. The conventional practice is to establish registration records for the basic information and cultural heritage of traditional villages combined with collecting historical records. This research develops a digital archival model to strengthen traditional village conservation. The theoretical framework of this model arises from a case study of Gaoqian, a typical traditional Chinese village with 1000 years of history. Through field investigation and document analysis, Gaoqian’s experience is summarized into a paradigm of traditional village digital archival conservation. There are three modules in this paradigm: a digital archival resource system, a digital archival management system, and a digital archival service system adhering to the culture-centred principle. This model transforms the initial cultural resources to digital archival resources and then to digital cultural products through strict life-cycle management. The whole working process needs the cooperation and participation of multiple subjects. The case of Gaoqian demonstrates that traditional village digital archival conservation is simultaneously universal and scene-oriented, which can provide replicable solutions for traditional villages or rural landscape conservation in other regions during ongoing world urbanization, with the appropriate archival perspective and methods. © 2022 Archives and Records Association."

This study is part of a research project focusing on the development of methods for the digital preservation of historic instruments. Part of the study is to investigate the spectral and temporal characteristics of this square piano in comparison to the virtual instrument under development and further to a modern Steinway B-211 piano. A solenoid is used to collect the necessary data sets from both real pianos. The spectral analysis includes the evaluation of the spectrogram, the spectral centroids and the spectral slope. The temporal analysis evaluates the correlation between velocity and loudness. These tests are used to validate the results of the project and to compare the historic square piano with a modern Steinway B-211 grand piano. The comparison shows deficits in the loudness curve of the virtual square piano. These deficits have to be compensated. Furthermore, the biggest difference between the Steinway B-211 and the square piano is the emphasis on the fundamental frequency. The lower emphasis on the fundamental frequency of the square piano results in a colder and harsher sound.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

X. Wang; K. Wu; Y. Zhang; Y. Xiao; P. Xu,2023,A GAN-based Denoising Method for Chinese Stele and Rubbing Calligraphic Image,"Chinese calligraphic images have important artistic and historical values. However, subjected to hundreds of years of natural weathering, corrosion and man-made destruction, Chinese calligraphic images inevitably contain some special noise, such as dotted noise, flake corrosion noise and scratch noise. How to denoise this special noise is a challenge for digital preservation of Chinese calligraphic. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end calligraphic image denoising algorithm based on a well-designed generative adversarial network. The generator contains a recurrent network and a denoising autoencoder. By introducing an attention mechanism, we use a recurrent network with multiple progressive network units to generate a noise attention map. Through the noise attention map, the denoising autoencoder can restore the noisy calligraphic image into a clean image with reduced noise or even no noise. The extensive experiments results show that the results of our method are better than those of other comparison methods in terms of visual effects, PSNR and SSIM. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
Y. Huang; S. Yang,2023,Spatio-temporal evolution and distribution of cultural heritage sites along the Suzhou canal of China,"The Grand Canal is one of the most important hydraulic engineering projects in Chinese history. The city of Suzhou has abundant and concentrated cultural heritage sites in the southern section of the Grand Canal. However, due to natural hazards, anthropogenic damage, and lack of human management, the cultural heritage sites have suffered irreversible damage. Digital preservation of these sites will make it possible to maintain their aesthetic and cultural value. This paper takes cultural heritage sites along the Suzhou Canal as its research subject and establishes a cultural heritage dataset using geographical information system (GIS). The paper uses geocoding and spatial analysis methods based on GIS, including nearest neighbor analysis, kernel density analysis, center of gravity analysis, and standard deviation ellipse. The paper explores the distribution of 104 cultural heritage sites along the Suzhou Canal across six historical periods and discusses the influencing factors for evolution of the distribution. The results show that: (1) major constructions on the Grand Canal water system were started in the Pre-Sui period and completed in the Sui and Tang Dynasties; (2) the degree of clustering of the distribution has increased since the Sui and Tang Dynasties until Modern Times; (3) the high-density area has been centered around the ancient city since the Pre-Sui period, and has shown a migration trend towards the Shantang Canal since the Ming Dynasty; (4) the center of gravity first moved from northwest to southeast along the Canal and then moved northeast towards the ancient city; (5) the aggregation of the sites peaked in the Qing dynasty (1636 CE-1911 CE), and the elliptical direction of distribution has become stable since then; and (6) the types of the cultural heritage in the evolution process are affected by the joint effects of natural and human factors, namely, elevation, canals, population, water transportation, and intangible cultural heritage, among which the canal characteristics play the decisive role. This study reveals the internal evolution mechanisms of the cultural heritage in the Suzhou Canal area and presents a scientific basis for the protection and utilization of the cultural heritage in other parts of the world. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Y. Li; Y. Du; M. Yang; J. Liang; H. Bai; R. Li; A. Law,2023,A review of the tools and techniques used in the digital preservation of architectural heritage within disaster cycles,"Architectural heritage is vulnerable to disasters. Digital technologies can fight destruction and can ensure integrity by monitoring, managing and protecting architectural heritage from disasters. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between disasters, digitalization and architectural heritage conservation for the sustainability of cultural heritage. This study used the PRISMA process, and bibliometric tools VOSviewer and Citespace to explore the potential of digital technologies in the protection of architectural heritage—especially during disaster cycles, from the perspectives of both universal and typicality; the results revealed that digital twins, deep learning, and preventive conservation are currently hot topics in digital preservation research (especially that research which relates to disaster cycles). On this basis, this paper summarizes the relevant technologies involved in architectural heritage preservation from the perspective of the disaster cycle and the digital phase, and proposes three future research directions: accurate prediction of multi-disasters, automatic early warning of structural damages, and intelligent monitoring of human–computer interaction. This paper constructs a new research frame for digital preservation of architectural heritage during disasters, providing theoretical reference and practical guidance for architectural heritage conversation. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
Y. Lu,2023,2022 Annual review of Huayu studies,"Based on the summary and analysis of the Huayu research results in 2022, this paper finds that compared with previous studies, the research concept has been updated, the research theory has been deepened and the research level has been improved. This is reflected in the following aspects: First, the depth and breadth of Huayu ontology research have been expanded. Some scholars have combed and summarized the research model of Huayu ontology and verified it with the help of language facts. Secondly, at the application level, the issue of three education""has received continuous attention and accumulated many research results; We have accumulated some successful experience in Huayu planning and have promoted it. Third, the relatively weak theoretical construction and empirical research of Huayu and the construction and application of Huayu corpus have made new breakthroughs. The former is mainly manifested in the formation of some new understanding through the investigation of Huayu facts; The latter is mainly reflected in the construction and application of the Huayu diachronic corpus, that is, the digital preservation and research of the century-old Nanyang Huayu resources. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."""
Z. Wenjun; S. Benpeng; F. Ruiqi; P. Xihua; C. Shanxiong,2023,EA-GAN: restoration of text in ancient Chinese books based on an example attention generative adversarial network,"Ancient Chinese books are of great significance to historical research and cultural inheritance. Unfortunately, many of these books have been damaged and corroded in the process of long-term transmission. The restoration by digital preservation of ancient books is a new method of conservation. Traditional character restoration methods ensure the visual consistency of character images through character features and the pixels around the damaged area. However, reconstructing characters often causes errors, especially when there is large damage in critical locations. Inspired by human’s imitation writing behavior, a two-branch structure character restoration network EA-GAN (Example Attention Generative Adversarial Network) is proposed, which is based on a generative adversarial network and fuses reference examples. By referring to the features of the example character, the damaged character can be restored accurately even when the damaged area is large. EA-GAN first uses two branches to extract the features of the damaged and example characters. Then, the damaged character is restored according to neighborhood information and features of the example character in different scales during the up-sampling stage. To solve problems when the example and damaged character features are not aligned and the convolution receptive field is too small, an Example Attention block is proposed to assist in restoration. Qualitative and quantitative analysis experiments are carried out on a self-built dataset MSACCSD and real scene pictures. Compared with current inpainting networks, EA-GAN can get the correct text structure through the guidance of the additional example in the Example Attention block. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity (SSIM) value increased by 9.82% and 1.82% respectively. The learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) value calculated by Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network and AlexNet decreased by 35.04% and 16.36% respectively. Our method obtained better results than the current inpainting methods. It also has a good restoration effect in the face of untrained characters, which is helpful for the digital preservation of ancient Chinese books. © 2023, The Author(s)."

A. Wielocha,2024,Collections of (An)archives: Towards a New Perspective on Institutional Collecting of Contemporary Art and the Object of Conservation,"The immanent features of contemporary art, understood as a new paradigm of artistic practice, call for new approaches to the institutional collecting and all interrelated practices, including conservation. The identity of a contemporary artwork is distributed between physical objects and processes, and concepts and contexts, which shape an artwork throughout its career. These intangible agents often exist in, and thus might be transmitted only through, various kinds of documents. The resulting documentation does not only contain information about an artwork’s provenance, history, meanings and character but it hosts an important part of the artwork itself. As decisions about the future presentations of artworks, and hence their interpretations, are made on the basis of documentation, the latter not only shapes but also determines the future of contemporary artworks. Still, in today’s museum practice the documentation is often secondary when compared to physical objects and undervalued within the hierarchy of museum priorities. This essay traces emergent institutional attempts to link, both conceptually and practically, museum collections and collection-related documentation. Its aim is to demonstrate that these approaches, while initially developed to address needs differing from traditional conservation, can serve as sources of inspiration for the development of long-term preservation strategies for contemporary art. © The Author(s) 2024."

Nackerud,2024,Preserving What We Publish Findings from the Library Publishing Coalition Preservation Task Force,"Library publishing programs have the potential to be a critical component of the community-controlled infrastructure pushing the scholarly publishing landscape toward more open and equitable practices. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that long-term preservation is particularly problematic for open access publications,1 and the products of library publishing programs are unfortunately not immune. While preservation is a significant challenge for small publishing programs generally, in many ways library publishers are in a better position to meet it than their non-library-affiliated peers. Libraries have long been centers for preservation and have invested in individuals, tools, and partnerships that are at the forefront of the preservation effort. Yet the expertise available in libraries often seems disconnected from the library publishing practitioners who could benefit from it. © 2024 Association of College and Research Libraries, a division of the American Library Association."

Traviglia,2024,X-ray computed microtomography: A non-invasive and time-efficient method for identifying and screening Roman copper-based coins,"This study utilises X-ray Computed Micro-Tomography (μXCT) as a non-destructive and non-invasive method to recover the original surface features and reveal the characteristics of encrusted, illegible Roman copper-based coins before any physical cleaning process is performed. The coins were retrieved from the topsoil during an archaeological survey in the countryside of the ancient city of Aquileia, Italy, and were severely degraded, covered with accumulated matter and pronounced encrustations developed over centuries of aging buried in soil. Despite their condition, most of the coins were identified from a numismatic standpoint using tomographic data alone, with the aid of reference images. They were subsequently cleaned using traditional manual methods and the results compared with μXCT. X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis of the coins after the physical cleaning confirmed their numismatic attribution and revealed information regarding the influence of different alloy compositions on the applicability of the μXCT method, as well as on the corrosion process of the coins. This study showcases how the application of μXCT on fragile corroded metal artifacts prior to any intrusive manual procedures can expedite the identification process, mitigating the risk of information loss caused by physical handling and cleaning. This approach proves particularly valuable when dealing with large numbers of coins that would typically require restoration for identification purposes. It also emphasises the numerous advantages of using μXCT for coin identification, provenance determination, dating, virtual restoration, digitisation, and long-term preservation. © 2023"
I. Aciobanitei; S.-C. Arseni; E. Bureaca; M. Togan,2024,A Comprehensive and Privacy-Aware Approach for Remote Qualified Electronic Signatures,"The current shift towards digital transactions emphasizes the need for robust Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) frameworks that safeguard integrity and privacy. Having the potential to become the leading type of adopted QES, the main challenge that Remote QESs present to end users is choosing between transmitting the entire document or only its digest to the Trust Service Provider (TSP). The first option compromises the document's confidentiality, while the second one requires the development of signature applications compliant with advanced signature formats, a task that often needs additional time and resources. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive strategy for remote QESs, designed for seamless integration with current client applications, while simultaneously maintaining user privacy. The main topics approached in this paper are the following: a comprehensive architecture for privacy-aware remote QES systems, relevant standards and legislation, integration scenarios for clients, and remote QES standard protocols to assure communication between client and TSP environments. Furthermore, we also explore the integration of our proposed solution with an enhanced long-term preservation service that uses Ethereum smart contracts and methodologies to implement signature applications with advanced electronic signatures via open-source libraries while ensuring document privacy. The main result of this work is a flexible on-premise module that provides the ability to sign, validate, and preserve documents, with a minimal integration effort."

K.-E. Marstein; J.-A. Grytnes; R. J. Lewis,2024,ECKOchain : A FAIR blockchain-based database for long-term ecological data,"Open data practices in ecology are increasingly accepted, yet primary long-term ecological data remain hard to find. Barriers preventing open long-term ecological data include social and economic constructs such as a sense of data proprietorship and fear of misuse of complex datasets. To incentivise open primary ecological data and ensure long-term preservation, we propose a decentralised data management approach using blockchain technology. The blockchain-based database is governed by transparent and immutable data management protocols, agreed on by members of the network. Specialised protocols ensure agreement in the network before new data is accepted, and no entity can single-handedly alter existing data. We introduce the ECKOchain, a 'proof of concept' ecological blockchain-based database created with the Hyperledger Fabric framework. While metadata and access policies are distributed to all network members, primary data remains with data owners and are served on-demand to approved parties according to specified usage licences. Details of data requests are preserved indefinitely on the blockchain and serve as auditable data usage agreements. With the distributed blockchain-based database we advocate for open science and transparency in long-term management of ecological data. The ECKOchain is also suitable for other scientific fields where auditability and transparency are considerations to long-term data management."

This research focuses on the San Su Shrine—a quintessential example of Xishu Garden—and explores the application of digital technologies in the commemorative research and quantitative preservation of these gardens. By integrating terrestrial laser scanning and terrestrial digital photogrammetry, we acquired quantitative data and constructed digital models to innovate upon the methodological approach to garden conservation. The innovation of this study is its analysis of Xishu Garden’s commemorative spaces through both temporal and spatial dimensions. 1) Temporally, this study examines the evolution and stratification of the garden's commemorative elements across various historical periods. 2) Spatially, it explores the interconnectedness of commemorative elements within the garden's buildings, rockery stones, water landscape and plant landscape. This dual-faceted approach yields novel insights and methods for assessing the universal value of the commemorative aspects of Xishu Garden. Moreover, it promotes the application of digital technology in the study and preservation of Xishu and other Chinese classical gardens. © The Author(s) 2024."
M. P. Eve,2024,Digital Scholarly Journals Are Poorly Preserved: A Study of 7 Million Articles,"Introduction: Digital preservation underpins the persistence of scholarly links and citations through the digital object identifier (DOI) system. We do not currently know, at scale, the extent to which articles assigned a DOI are adequately preserved. Methods: We construct a database of preservation information from original archival sources and then exam-ine the preservation statuses of 7,438,037 DOIs in a random sample. Results: Of the 7,438,037 works examined, there were 5.9 million copies spread over the archives used in this work. Furthermore, a total of 4,342,368 of the works that we studied (58.38%) were present in at least one archive. However, this left 2,056,492 works in our sample (27.64%) that are seemingly unpreserved. The remaining 13.98% of works in the sample were excluded either for being too recent (published in the current year), not being journal articles, or having insufficient date metadata for us to identify the source. Discussion: Our study is limited by design in several ways. Among these are the facts that it uses only a subset of archives, it only tracks articles with DOIs, and it does not account for institutional repository coverage. Nonetheless, as an initial attempt to gauge the landscape, our results will still be of interest to libraries, publishers, and researchers. Conclusion: This work reveals an alarming preservation deficit. Only 0.96% of Crossref members (n = 204) can be confirmed to digitally preserve over 75% of their content in three or more of the archives that we studied. (Note that when, in this article, we write “preserved,” we mean “that we were able to confirm as preserved,” as per the specified limitations of this study.) A slightly larger proportion, i.e., 8.5% (n = 1,797), preserved over 50% of their content in two or more archives. However, many members, i.e., 57.7% (n = 12,257), only met the threshold of having 25% of their material in a single archive. Most worryingly, 32.9% (n = 6,982) of Crossref members seem not to have any adequate digital preservation in place, which is against the recommendations of the Digital Preservation Coalition. © 2024 The Author(s)."
N. Botica; L. Luís; P.

The Archaeological Park of the Côa Valley has meticulously documented these rock art motifs, employing various techniques including direct tracing processes on the rocks, using both natural and artificial lighting. However, this intensive work is highly demanding, especially considering that many of the rocks are not easily accessible. In the context of the Open Access Rock Art Repository"" (RARAA) project, this paper presents a methodology for the three-dimensional (3D) survey of rocks with rock art motifs, as well as the subsequent production of orthophotos from the resulting 3D models, accomplished through photogrammetry. These orthophotos serve as the foundation for the vector drawing of the motifs. Remarkably, the level of detail captured in these records has shown that most of the motifs are visible and can be accurately represented through the orthophotos. This has significantly reduced the time required for field surveys. However, in certain cases where specific small areas of the panel are affected by challenging lighting conditions, further fieldwork is still necessary, analogous to the direct tracing process. Additionally, this study introduces an information system designed to integrate the vector graphics and the motifs characterisation data; this supports enhanced research in the area and promotes improved open access for potential reuse in new interpretations or integration into future projects. By creating highly detailed 3D models, the authors complement the two-dimensional drawings of the surfaces and ensure the digital preservation of both the rocks and the associated iconography. These records serve as highly detailed digital surrogates that facilitate the monitoring efforts of the rocks and motifs; they also guarantee the availability of valuable resources for future research and analysis, even if natural or deliberate changes occur. © UPV, SEAV, 2015"""

This has given rise to folksonomies or social indexing, and the duty of information services to integrate user participation in the organization of their digital collections, and thus incorporate folksonomies in their information organization practices. This article presents a case study of the involvement of users of an academic museum and archive in the indexing of a set of resources within a project on digital preservation. The main objective of this study was to analyse the labels or tags suggested by a group of six students from several scientific areas who participated in the experience, and explain the criteria they used to choose and assign the terms to represent the content of the documents. The responses were categorized based on content analysis. The labels assigned by the students were also compared with the indexing terms used by information professionals. Although the students were not familiar with the methods of information professionals, they gained enough sensitivity to understand the need for term validation and recognize that term selection is a subjective choice. © The Author(s) 2024."

Methods: Two qualitative perspectives are considered in the case study: the practice turn and the perspective of the study of behavior and informational practices to study the strategy and informational interactions of the collaboration model developed between a research center with more than 200 integrated researchers (CHAM - Center for the Humanities) and the specialized Digital Development of Research Services (DDRS) team from the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of Universidade NOVA de Lisboa. Methods such as document analysis, observation and analysis of informational practices were used. Results: The collaboration model is analyzed in its main strategic characteristics and informational practices: active and continuous dialogue between the research community, supported by DDRS coaching activities, focused on obtaining a generalized but flexible consensus around the research, digital curation, and preservation. Its implementation results from a double Top-down strategy, guaranteeing organizational support and information governance, and Bottom-up, constituting a community-led process, developing two interrelated actions: a pilot data management test experience and the evaluation collection of research project sites with recommendations for their sustainability, interoperability, digital preservation, and curation. Conclusions: The construction of the strategy centered on shared critical reflection perspective of joint solutions and synergies for the construction of participatory digital preservation policies."
S. Allegrezza,2024,File formats conversion issues in digital libraries,"The issue of file format conversion is critical in the realm of digital libraries. In fact, a digital library can include text, still images, audio, video, digital documents, or other digital media formats. These digital objects are encoded in the most diverse file formats, but they are eventually doomed to become obsolete (and in some cases have already done so). As a result, the challenge of identifying when file format conversion is required, which formats to choose for conversion, and which approaches to apply from an operational standpoint begins to emerge. However, while being theorized as one of the most successful digital preservation solutions, format conversion has yet to be sufficiently practiced. Even when the need to transfer digital objects from an obsolete format to a more modern format is adequately felt, the process is often delayed due to a lack of knowledge and expertise, as well as a lack of clear and precise guidelines and advice on how the conversion should be carried out, including technical-operational methods. This paper attempts to address this problem by emphasizing the rationale for format conversion (Why), the circumstances under which it must occur (When), and the methods by which it can be done (How), citing both international norms and guidelines and the Italian Guidelines on the creation, management, and preservation of electronic documents,"" published by the Italian Agency for Digital Government. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."""

These teachings imply that practitioners are meeting a professional standard of recordation that will stand the test of time, but the ongoing digital revolution is changing the way records and data are created and preserved. Best practices for the management and use of digital archaeological records have been published, and devoted digital archives offer these services. However, the ability of traditional archaeological repositories to adopt best practices or pay for digital curation is poorly understood. This article presents the results of a survey asking how the flood of digital records and data has impacted the ability of archaeological repositories to collect, manage, preserve, use, and make accessible digital archaeological records and data. Are repositories adopting the best practices that have been outlined? What kinds of challenges do repositories face regarding digital records and data? Are they being overcome successfully? The survey results offer a snapshot of current practice and point to future directions that should be pursued to ensure that the discipline is meeting its professional obligations.

This knowledge is a significant resource which could contribute to the sustainability development of rural communities and society at large. Given that this valuable knowledge is irreplaceable, its promotion and protection is critical. Digital preservation has become a popular method for revitalization and safeguarding indigenous knowledge in recent years. The purpose of this study was to determine how digital preservation can be used in enhancing long-term access to indigenous knowledge for sustainable development of indigenous communities in South Africa. This study used literature review to investigate strategies being established in South Africa and different parts of the world to revitalize and digitally preserve indigenous knowledge for the benefits of indigenous communities. This study established that indigenous knowledge owners and their communities do not have mechanisms and policy being put in place for effective digital preservation of their indigenous knowledge. The study thus recommends that anticolonial strategies and policy in the protection of indigenous knowledge systems be implemented and be the subject of a real training and awareness raising programme for community members. © 2023, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2023 Tlou Maggie Masenya."
V. Pasqui,2024,Digital curation and long-term digital preservation in libraries,"For over twenty years public institutions and foundations committed in cultural heritage curation and preservation worked up methodologies, strategies and techniques for long-term digital preservation of digital resources. Thanks to a relevant number of initiatives and services carried on by international institutions and specialized agencies, public and private libraries reached a high level of awareness in this field which requires continuous adaptation due to the constant evolution of publishing industry and the rapid emergence of Open Science. After a quick review of digital preservation milestones, this article looks at some emerging trends and issues which charac-terize the constant transformation of digital preservation landscape. Dynamic generated digital contents and Open Science to fulfil findability, accessibility, interoperability and reuse (FAIR) of digital assets are engaging new challenges for existing digital preservation services. Digital curation and digital preservation are deeply merged and proceed in parallel to assure long-term usage of digital resources and data. How to select and deploy digital preservation platforms is another complex area where Cloud services can offer the opportunity to reduce the costs of technical infrastructures maintenance and man-agement. Policy and decision making institutional levels need more awareness to draw up digital preservation strategies and to activate services to assure digital contents and data long-term access and reuse. Finally the paper suggests to promote “digital preservation by design” as a new base rule to be applied since the conception of every project and initiative in the cultural heritage, scientific and academic contexts. © 2024, The Author(s)."
X. Wang,2024,Research on the Protection and Dissemination of Intangible Cultural Heritage with Regional Cultural Characteristics in Shaanxi under the Background of Big Data,"Cultural heritage is a response to the characteristics of a society and deserves to be protected and passed on to future generations, but there is still a lack of knowledge and skills related to it in the methodology of digital preservation of intangible cultural heritage. This paper aims to digitally preserve intangible cultural heritage in Shaanxi by utilizing methods such as feature point description, image edge detection, and visual feature extraction. The scale space expression algorithm is applied to keep the feature point scale of the intangible cultural heritage unchanged, and the scale space of the image is obtained by convolving the Gaussian convolution kernel with the image. The Sobel operator is employed to evaluate the significance of pixels in the non-heritage image to identify the edge effect of the image. Focusing on analyzing the digitization types of Shaanxi's non-legacy, we explored the role of images in the protection of non-legacy and formulated the dissemination path of Internet+Non-legacy for the current situation of Shaanxi's non-legacy. The results show that among the 12 NHs in Shaanxi, the number of textual materials is the largest, accounting for 43.33% of all digital materials, followed by the proportion of images at 33.33%, and the current digitization of NHs needs the supplementation of audiovisual materials the most, with audiovisual materials accounting for only 23.33%. The value of images for the protection of non-heritage cultural heritage reflects the non-heritage characteristics intuitively, and the range of Shaanxi non-heritage image dissemination index is in the range of 21-89 interval, and with the change of time, people pay more and more attention to Shaanxi non-heritage. © 2024 Sciendo.
